Okay, so I need to find the radius of the smaller semicircle in this geometry problem. Let me start by understanding the given information and visualizing the figure.

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
First, there's a circle with center Q, and radii AQ and BQ form a right angle. That means the angle between AQ and BQ is 90 degrees, so the sector formed by points A, Q, and B is a quarter-circle. The radius of this main circle is given as 14 inches. 

Now, there are two smaller regions that are tangent semicircles. Since they are semicircles and they are tangent, they must each be touching the other and possibly the sides of the sector. The figure is shown, but since I can't see it, I need to imagine or sketch a diagram based on the description. 

Let me try to visualize: in the right angle sector (since AQ and BQ are radii forming a right angle), there are two smaller semicircles. Each of these semicircles is tangent to each other and also tangent to the two radii AQ and BQ. Additionally, they might be tangent to the arc AB of the main circle. Wait, but the problem says "the two smaller regions are tangent semicircles". Hmm, maybe the semicircles are each sitting in the corner formed by the two radii and the arc?

Based on execution_1.1:
Let me try to sketch this mentally. If you have a quarter-circle (sector with 90 degrees), and inside it, two semicircles are placed such that each is tangent to the two radii and to each other, and perhaps also tangent to the arc AB. But since they are semicircles, their diameters must lie along the radii AQ and BQ.

Wait, if they are semicircles, then their flat sides would be along the radii, and the curved parts would be inside the sector. Since they are tangent to each other, their centers must be separated by a distance equal to the sum of their radii.

Let me denote the radius of the smaller semicircle as r and the radius of the larger semicircle as R. But wait, the problem mentions "the two smaller regions".

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to model this. Suppose the two semicircles are arranged such that one is in the corner near A and the other is near B, each tangent to their respective radii, to each other, and to the arc AB. Let me think.

Wait, maybe there's only one smaller semicircle? Wait, the problem says "the two smaller regions are tangent semicircles". So there are two semicircles, both smaller than the main circle, and they are tangent to each other. The main circle has radius 14, so maybe the two semicircles fit into the quarter-circle, each touching the two radii, each other, and the arc AB. But since they are semicircles, their diameters must be along the radii. Wait, but if their diameters are along the radii, then their centers would be at a distance of r from the center Q, right?

Wait, let's clarify. If the semicircles are tangent to both radii AQ and BQ, then their centers must be at a distance equal to their radius from each of these radii. Since AQ and BQ are perpendicular, the centers of the semicircles would lie along the angle bisector, which in this case is the line at 45 degrees from AQ and BQ. But since there are two semicircles, maybe one is closer to point A and the other closer to point B? 

Wait, perhaps each semicircle is tangent to one radius and the other radius, but also tangent to the arc AB. But since they are semicircles, their flat side is along the radius. Let me try to model this.

Wait, the problem says "the two smaller regions are tangent semicircles". So maybe there are two semicircles, both smaller than the main circle, and both tangent to each other. Since the main circle has radius 14, perhaps the two semicircles are each in one of the two quadrants formed by the two radii? But since they are semicircles, their diameters would have to be along the radii or along the arc. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me try to clarify.
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
Let me consider the quarter-circle with radius 14. The two semicircles must fit inside this quarter-circle, each touching the two radii, each other, and the arc. 

Wait, but semicircles have their diameter on a straight line. If the semicircles are tangent to both radii AQ and BQ, then their centers must be at a distance equal to their radius from each of these radii. Since AQ and BQ are perpendicular, the centers of the semicircles would lie along the angle bisector, which in this case is the line at 45 degrees from AQ and BQ. 

But if there are two semicircles, they must be placed such that one is closer to point A and the other closer to point B. Let me denote the radius of the smaller semicircle as r and the radius of the larger one as R. However, the problem states "the two smaller regions", so maybe both semicircles are smaller than the main circle, but one is smaller than the other. Wait, the problem says "the two smaller regions are tangent semicircles". So perhaps both semicircles are smaller than the main circle, but one is smaller than the other. Wait, but the problem might just be referring to both being smaller semicircles, but not necessarily each other's sizes. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify that.
</execution_2.3>

<execution_2.4>
Since the semicircle is tangent to both radii, which are perpendicular, the center must lie along the angle bisector, which in this case is the line y = x if we consider Q at the origin, A along the x-axis, and B along the y-axis. So the center of the smaller semicircle would be at (r, r), and the center of the larger semicircle would be at (14 - R, R), but wait, no. Wait, if the larger semicircle is also tangent to both radii, its center would be at (R, R) but since it's a different size. Wait, maybe not. Wait, if the semicircle is tangent to both radii, then the distance from the center to each radius must equal the radius of the semicircle. So if the semicircle is in the corner, its center is at (r, r) if the radii are along the x and y axes. Similarly, the other semicircle would also be in the corner, but maybe on the other side? Wait, but there are only two semicircles. Wait, maybe one is in the corner near A and the other is in the corner near B. But if they are both tangent to each other, then their centers must be separated by a distance equal to the sum of their radii.

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Let me try to draw this mentally. Suppose we have a quarter-circle with center Q, radii AQ and BQ forming a right angle, and the arc AB. Inside this quarter-circle, there are two semicircles. Each semicircle is tangent to both radii (so their centers are at a distance equal to their radius from each radius) and also tangent to each other. Additionally, they might be tangent to the arc AB. 

Wait, but if they are semicircles, their flat sides would be along the radii, right? So the diameter of each semicircle would lie along one of the radii. For example, the smaller semicircle might have its diameter along a segment of AQ, and the larger one along a segment of BQ, but that might not make sense because they need to be tangent to each other.

Wait, perhaps the two semicircles are arranged such that each is tangent to both radii and to the arc AB, and also to each other. But since they are semicircles, their curved parts would be inside the quarter-circle, and their diameters would be along the radii.

Based on execution_2.4:
So let's denote the smaller semicircle's radius as r and the larger one as R. Wait, but the problem mentions "the two smaller regions".

Wait, but if the diameter is along the radius, then the center of each semicircle would be at a distance equal to their radius from the center Q. Wait, no. If the diameter is along AQ, then the center would be at a distance of r from the endpoint of the diameter. Wait, maybe I need to clarify.

Let me consider the smaller semicircle. If its diameter is along a segment of AQ, then the center of the semicircle would be at the midpoint of the diameter. So if the diameter is of length 2r (since the radius is r), then the center is r units away from each end. But since the semicircle is inside the quarter-circle, the center of the smaller semicircle would be at a point along AQ, but also must be a distance r from the other radius BQ. Wait, but if the diameter is along AQ, then the semicircle would extend towards BQ. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I need to set up coordinates.

Let's place the center Q at the origin (0,0), radius AQ along the positive x-axis, and radius BQ along the positive y-axis. The quarter-circle then occupies the first quadrant. The two smaller regions are tangent semicircles. Let's assume that one semicircle is tangent to the x-axis, the y-axis, and the arc AB. Similarly, the other semicircle is also tangent to the x-axis, y-axis, and arc AB, but on the opposite side? But since there are only two semicircles, maybe they are arranged such that one is in the lower part and the other in the upper part of the quarter-circle. Wait, but the problem says "the two smaller regions", so maybe both are inside the quarter-circle, each tangent to both radii and the arc, and tangent to each other.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
Wait, maybe there's a misinterpretation here. Wait, the problem says "the radius of the smaller semicircle", so perhaps there is only one smaller semicircle and another larger one, but both are smaller than the main circle. Wait, but the problem mentions "the two smaller regions", which implies that there are two regions, both smaller, and they are the semicircles. Wait, maybe the main circle is divided into three regions: the two semicircles and the remaining region. But the problem states that the two smaller regions are the tangent semicircles. So the main circle's area is divided into three parts: two semicircular regions (the smaller ones) and the remaining region. But the problem is about finding the radius of the smaller semicircle.

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
Let me try to model this. 

If a semicircle is tangent to both the x-axis and y-axis, its center must be at (r, r), and its equation would be (x - r)^2 + (y - r)^2 = r^2, but since it's a semicircle, perhaps only the upper half or the right half? Wait, if the diameter is along the x-axis from (0,0) to (2r, 0), then the semicircle would be above the x-axis, centered at (r, 0), but that wouldn't be tangent to the y-axis. Wait, maybe I need to reconsider.

Wait, if the semicircle is tangent to both the x-axis and y-axis, then its center must be at (r, r), and the semicircle would have a diameter that is the line segment from (0, r) to (r, 0), but that doesn't form a standard semicircle. Wait, perhaps the semicircle is oriented such that its diameter is along the line y = x, from (0,0) to (2r, 2r), but then the center would be at (r, r), and the semicircle would curve outward. However, this might not be tangent to both axes. Wait, maybe this approach is not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the semicircles are each tangent to one radius and the arc AB. For example, the smaller semicircle is tangent to radius AQ (the x-axis), radius AB (the arc of the main circle), and the larger semicircle. Similarly, the other semicircle is tangent to radius BQ (the y-axis), radius AB, and the smaller semicircle. But this configuration might form a chain of semicircles, which seems unlikely.

Based on execution_3.2:
Alternatively, perhaps the two semicircles are both tangent to each other and to the two radii, and also to the arc AB. In that case, each semicircle is in a corner formed by the two radii and the arc. But since the two semicircles are tangent to each other, their centers must be separated by a distance equal to the sum of their radii. Let me try to model this.

<execution_4.1>
Wait, maybe each semicircle is tangent to both radii and the arc AB. Let me think again.

If a semicircle is tangent to both radii AQ and BQ (which are along the x and y axes) and also tangent to the arc AB of the main circle, then its center must be at (r, r), and the distance from the center to the origin Q must be equal to 14 - r, since the semicircle is inside the main circle. Wait, the distance from Q (0,0) to the center of the semicircle (r, r) is sqrt(r^2 + r^2) = r*sqrt(2). This distance plus the radius of the semicircle (r) should equal the radius of the main circle (14). So:

r*sqrt(2) + r = 14

r (sqrt(2) + 1) = 14

r = 14 / (sqrt(2) + 1)

Rationalizing the denominator:

r = 14 (sqrt(2) - 1) / ( (sqrt(2) + 1)(sqrt(2) - 1) ) = 14 (sqrt(2) - 1) / (2 - 1) = 14 (sqrt(2) - 1)

But this would be the radius of a single semicircle tangent to both radii and the arc. However, the problem mentions two semicircles. So perhaps there are two such semicircles, each tangent to both radii and the arc, but on opposite sides? But in a right angle sector, there's only one such position where a semicircle can be tangent to both radii and the arc. So maybe this approach is incorrect.
</execution_4.1>

<execution_4.2>
Let me set up a coordinate system with Q at (0,0), radius AQ along the x-axis, and radius BQ along the y-axis. The main circle has radius 14, so the arc AB is part of the circle x² + y² = 14². 

Now, let's consider the smaller semicircle. If it's tangent to both the x-axis and y-axis, its center must be at (r, r), where r is its radius. Similarly, the larger semicircle would be tangent to both axes and have its center at (R, R), where R is its radius. However, since there are only two semicircles, and they are tangent to each other, the distance between their centers should be equal to r + R. 

The distance between (r, r) and (R, R) is sqrt[(R - r)^2 + (R - r)^2] = sqrt[2(R - r)^2] = (R - r)√2. 

But since the semicircles are also tangent to each other, this distance should equal r + R. Therefore:

(R - r)√2 = r + R

Let me solve this equation:

√2(R - r) = R + r

√2 R - √2 r = R + r

Bring terms with R to one side and terms with r to the other:

√2 R - R = √2 r + r

Factor out R and r:

R(√2 - 1) = r(√2 + 1)

Therefore, R = r * (√2 + 1)/(√2 - 1)

To rationalize the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (√2 + 1):

R = r * (√2 + 1)^2 / [(√2 - 1)(√2 + 1)] 

Denominator becomes ( (√2)^2 - (1)^2 ) = 2 - 1 = 1

Therefore, R = r * ( (√2)^2 + 2√2*1 + 1^2 ) = r * (2 + 2√2 + 1) = r*(3 + 2√2)

So R = r*(3 + 2√2)

Now, we also need to consider that the semicircles are tangent to the arc AB of the main circle. That means the distance from the center of each semicircle to the center Q must be equal to 14 - r (for the smaller semicircle) and 14 - R (for the larger semicircle), since they are tangent internally to the main circle.

Wait, but the center of the smaller semicircle is at (r, r), so the distance from Q (0,0) to (r, r) is sqrt(r² + r²) = r√2. This distance should equal 14 - r, because the semicircle is tangent to the main circle. Similarly for the larger semicircle, the distance from Q to (R, R) is R√2 = 14 - R.

Therefore, for the smaller semicircle:

r√2 = 14 - r

Similarly, for the larger semicircle:

R√2 = 14 - R

But since we already have R in terms of r, R = r*(3 + 2√2), let's use the equation for the smaller semicircle:

r√2 + r = 14

r(√2 + 1) = 14

Therefore, r = 14 / (√2 + 1)

Again, rationalizing the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (√2 - 1):

r = 14*(√2 - 1) / [ (√2 + 1)(√2 - 1) ] 

Denominator is 2 - 1 = 1

So r = 14*(√2 - 1)

But let's check if this satisfies the other equation. Let's compute R:

R = r*(3 + 2√2) = 14*(√2 - 1)*(3 + 2√2)

Let me compute this:

First, multiply (√2 - 1)(3 + 2√2):

= √2*3 + √2*2√2 - 1*3 - 1*2√2

= 3√2 + 4 - 3 - 2√2

= (3√2 - 2√2) + (4 - 3)

= √2 + 1

Therefore, R = 14*(√2 + 1)

Now, check the equation for the larger semicircle:

R√2 = 14*(√2 + 1)*√2 = 14*(2 + √2)

And 14 - R = 14 - 14*(√2 + 1) = 14 - 14√2 - 14 = -14√2

Wait, this gives R√2 = 14*(2 + √2) and 14 - R = -14√2, which are not equal. This is a problem. 

So there's a contradiction here. That suggests that my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the centers of the semicircles are not at (r, r) and (R, R). 

Wait, perhaps the semicircles are not tangent to both the x-axis and y-axis. Maybe they are tangent to one radius and the arc AB. Let me re-examine the problem statement. 

The problem says: "the two smaller regions are tangent semicircles". The main circle has radii AQ and BQ forming a right angle, so the sector is a quarter-circle. The two smaller regions (semicircles) are inside this quarter-circle. If they are semicircles, they might each be tangent to one radius and the arc AB, and also tangent to each other. 

Alternatively, perhaps each semicircle is tangent to one radius (AQ or BQ), the arc AB, and the other semicircle. 

Let me consider one of the semicircles. If it's tangent to radius AQ (the x-axis), the arc AB (which is part of the main circle x² + y² = 14²), and also tangent to the other semicircle. Similarly, the other semicircle is tangent to radius BQ (y-axis), arc AB, and the first semicircle. 

In this case, each semicircle would have its diameter along the radius, but curved towards the arc AB. 

Let me model the smaller semicircle tangent to the x-axis, the main arc AB, and the other semicircle. Let's denote the radius of the smaller semicircle as r. Its center would be at (r, k), where k is the y-coordinate. Since it's tangent to the x-axis, the distance from the center to the x-axis is k, which must equal the radius r. Therefore, k = r. So the center is at (r, r). 

Wait, but if the center is at (r, r), then the distance from the center to the origin Q is sqrt(r² + r²) = r√2. Since the semicircle is tangent to the main circle of radius 14, the distance from Q to the center of the semicircle plus the radius of the semicircle should equal 14. Wait, no. If the semicircle is inside the main circle and tangent to it, then the distance from Q to the center of the semicircle plus the radius of the semicircle equals 14. 

Wait, the main circle has radius 14, and the semicircle is inside it. The center of the semicircle is at (r, r), so the distance from Q (0,0) to (r, r) is r√2. The radius of the semicircle is r. Since they are tangent, the distance from Q to the center of the semicircle plus the radius of the semicircle should equal the radius of the main circle. 

Wait, but that would mean:

r√2 + r = 14

Which is the same equation as before. So r(√2 + 1) = 14, so r = 14 / (√2 + 1) = 14(√2 - 1)/ ( (√2 + 1)(√2 - 1) ) = 14(√2 - 1)/1 = 14(√2 - 1). 

But this is approximately 14*(1.4142 - 1) = 14*0.4142 ≈ 5.8, which seems reasonable. But earlier when considering the larger semicircle, there was a problem. 

Wait, perhaps there is only one semicircle? But the problem mentions two smaller regions. So maybe there are two semicircles, each tangent to one radius, the arc, and each other. 

Let me denote the smaller semicircle as having radius r and the larger one R. Both are tangent to their respective radii (r for the smaller one near AQ, R for the larger one near BQ), both are tangent to the main circle, and tangent to each other. 

So for the smaller semicircle (radius r), its center is at (r, r), distance from Q is r√2, which must equal 14 - r (since the semicircle is inside the main circle). So:

r√2 = 14 - r

Similarly, for the larger semicircle (radius R), its center is at (R, R), distance from Q is R√2 = 14 - R

But also, the two semicircles are tangent to each other, so the distance between their centers (r, r) and (R, R) must be equal to r + R. The distance between (r, r) and (R, R) is sqrt[(R - r)^2 + (R - r)^2] = sqrt[2(R - r)^2] = (R - r)√2. This distance should equal r + R. Therefore:

(R - r)√2 = R + r

So we have three equations:

1. r√2 = 14 - r
2. R√2 = 14 - R
3. (R - r)√2 = R + r

From equations 1 and 2, we can solve for R in terms of r. Let's solve equation 1:

r√2 + r = 14

r(√2 + 1) = 14

r = 14 / (√2 + 1) = 14(√2 - 1)/[(√2 + 1)(√2 - 1)] = 14(√2 - 1)/1 = 14(√2 - 1)

Similarly, equation 2 gives:

R = 14(√2 - 1) as well? Wait, but that would mean R = r, which contradicts the idea that there is a smaller and a larger semicircle. 

Wait, this suggests that both r and R are equal, which can't be correct. There must be a mistake here. 

Wait, perhaps my assumption that both semicircles are tangent to both radii and the arc is incorrect. Maybe each semicircle is tangent to one radius and the arc, but not both. Let me clarify.

Suppose the smaller semicircle is tangent to radius AQ (x-axis) and the arc AB, and the larger semicircle is tangent to radius BQ (y-axis) and the arc AB, and the two semicircles are tangent to each other. 

In this case, the smaller semicircle would have its diameter along AQ, but curved towards the arc. Wait, but if it's a semicircle tangent to the x-axis and the arc AB, its center would be somewhere above the x-axis. Similarly, the larger semicircle would be tangent to the y-axis and the arc AB, with its center somewhere to the right of the y-axis. 

Let me model the smaller semicircle. If it's tangent to the x-axis, then the distance from its center to the x-axis is equal to its radius, say r. So the y-coordinate of its center is r. Also, since it's tangent to the arc AB, which is part of the main circle of radius 14, the distance from Q (0,0) to the center of the smaller semicircle (let's call it (a, r)) must be equal to 14 - r. Because the semicircle is inside the main circle, so the distance from Q to the center plus the radius of the semicircle equals the main radius. 

Wait, no. If the semicircle is tangent to the main circle, then the distance between their centers plus the radius of the semicircle equals the main radius. Wait, actually, if two circles are tangent internally, the distance between their centers is equal to the difference of their radii. Since the main circle has radius 14, and the semicircle has radius r, the distance between Q and the center of the semicircle is 14 - r. 

So the center of the smaller semicircle is at (a, r), and the distance from (0,0) to (a, r) is sqrt(a² + r²) = 14 - r.

Additionally, the semicircle is tangent to the x-axis, so its center must be at a distance r from the x-axis, which it is (y-coordinate is r). But also, since it's a semicircle, its diameter must be along a line. Wait, if it's tangent to the x-axis and the arc AB, perhaps it's a semicircle whose diameter is along a line parallel to the y-axis. 

Alternatively, maybe the semicircle is constructed such that its flat side is along the x-axis, curving up into the main circle. In that case, the center would be at (r, r), but then the distance from the center to the origin would be sqrt(r² + r²) = r√2, which should equal 14 - r. So again, r√2 = 14 - r, leading to r = 14/(√2 + 1) = 14(√2 - 1). 

Similarly, the larger semicircle would have its center at (R, R), with distance R√2 = 14 - R, leading to the same value R = 14(√2 - 1). But this would mean both semicircles have the same radius, which contradicts the problem statement of having two smaller regions, one of which is smaller. 

Therefore, my initial assumption must be wrong. Perhaps the two semicircles are not both tangent to the arc AB. Maybe one is tangent to the x-axis and the other to the y-axis, and both are tangent to each other and to the main circle. 

Wait, let's consider that. Let's say the smaller semicircle is tangent to the x-axis and the main circle, and the larger semicircle is tangent to the y-axis and the main circle, and the two semicircles are tangent to each other. In this case, each semicircle would have its center along the x-axis and y-axis, respectively. 

For the smaller semicircle (tangent to x-axis and main circle):

Let its radius be r. Its center is at (r, 0). The distance from (r, 0) to Q (0,0) is r, so since it's tangent to the main circle of radius 14, the distance from Q to the center plus the radius of the semicircle equals 14. Wait, no. If the semicircle is inside the main circle and tangent to it, then the distance from Q to the center of the semicircle plus the radius of the semicircle equals 14. 

Wait, the center of the smaller semicircle is at (r, 0). The distance from Q to this center is r. The semicircle has radius r, so the distance from the center of the semicircle to the main circle's edge is 14 - r. But since the semicircle is tangent to the main circle, the distance from Q to the center of the semicircle plus the radius of the semicircle equals 14. 

Wait, that would be r (distance from Q to semicircle center) + r (radius of semicircle) = 14. So 2r = 14 => r = 7. But that can't be, because then the larger semicircle would also have radius 7, and they would overlap. 

Alternatively, maybe the distance from Q to the center of the semicircle is 14 - r. So sqrt((r)^2 + 0^2) = 14 - r => r = 14 - r => 2r = 14 => r = 7. Again, same result. 

But this would mean the smaller semicircle has radius 7, but the problem says there are two smaller regions. 

This suggests that my approach is flawed. Let me try a different method. 

Perhaps the two semicircles are arranged such that their centers lie along the angle bisector of the right angle, which is the line y = x in the coordinate system. Let me assume that the two semicircles are placed symmetrically with respect to the line y = x, but since they are two different regions, maybe not. 

Alternatively, perhaps the two semicircles are such that their centers lie along the line y = x, but each is tangent to one of the radii and the arc. 

Wait, let's consider the smaller semicircle. If it's tangent to the x-axis, the y-axis, and the arc AB, then its center would be at (r, r), and the distance from the center to the origin is r√2. Since it's tangent to the main circle of radius 14, we have r√2 + r = 14, which gives r = 14 / (√2 + 1) = 14(√2 - 1) ≈ 5.8. 

But then, if there's another semicircle, perhaps in the same position but on the other side, but the problem states "the two smaller regions are tangent semicircles", implying two distinct regions. 

Alternatively, maybe the two semicircles are arranged such that one is in the lower part and the other in the left part of the quarter-circle, each tangent to their respective radius, the arc, and each other. 

Let me model this. Let the smaller semicircle be tangent to the x-axis, the arc AB, and the larger semicircle. The larger semicircle is tangent to the y-axis, the arc AB, and the smaller semicircle. 

For the smaller semicircle (radius r), its center is at (r, r), distance from Q is r√2, which equals 14 - r (since it's inside the main circle). So:

r√2 = 14 - r → r = 14 / (√2 + 1) = 14(√2 - 1)

Similarly, the larger semicircle (radius R) would have its center at (R, R), distance from Q is R√2 = 14 - R → R = 14 / (√2 + 1) = same as r. 

But this would mean both semicircles have the same radius, which contradicts the problem's mention of "the smaller semicircle". 

Therefore, my assumption that both semicircles are placed in the same manner is incorrect. 

Perhaps the two semicircles are arranged differently. Maybe one is tangent to the x-axis and the arc, and the other is tangent to the y-axis and the other semicircle. 

Let me try this. Let the smaller semicircle (radius r) be tangent to the x-axis and the arc AB. Its center is at (r, r), distance from Q is r√2 = 14 - r → r = 14/(√2 + 1) = 14(√2 - 1). 

The larger semicircle (radius R) is tangent to the y-axis, the arc AB, and the smaller semicircle. Its center is at (R, R), distance from Q is R√2 = 14 - R → R = 14/(√2 + 1) = same as r. 

But again, this leads to R = r, which can't be. 

Alternatively, perhaps the larger semicircle is not placed at (R, R), but somewhere else. Wait, if the larger semicircle is tangent to the y-axis, the arc AB, and the smaller semicircle, its center might not be at (R, R). 

Wait, if the larger semicircle is tangent to the y-axis, its center must be at (R, k), where k is the y-coordinate. Since it's tangent to the y-axis, the distance from the center to the y-axis is R, so the x-coordinate is R. But it's also tangent to the arc AB, which is part of the main circle x² + y² = 14². Therefore, the distance from Q (0,0) to the center (R, k) is sqrt(R² + k²) = 14 - R (since the semicircle is inside the main circle). 

Additionally, the larger semicircle is tangent to the smaller semicircle. The distance between their centers (r, r) and (R, k) must equal r + R. So sqrt((R - r)^2 + (k - r)^2) = r + R. 

But this seems complicated. Let me see if there's a better way. 

Alternatively, perhaps the two semicircles are arranged such that their centers lie along the line y = x, but their positions are such that they are tangent to each other. 

Wait, let me consider the smaller semicircle with radius r and center at (r, r). The larger semicircle, with radius R, would then have its center at (R, R). The distance between centers is (R - r)√2, which equals r + R. So:

(R - r)√2 = R + r

Which leads to R = r*(3 + 2√2), as before. 

But then, both semicircles must satisfy their respective distance from the origin:

For smaller semicircle: r√2 = 14 - r → r = 14/(√2 + 1) = 14(√2 - 1)

For larger semicircle: R√2 = 14 - R → R = 14/(√2 + 1) = same as r. 

But this contradicts R = r*(3 + 2√2). 

This suggests that the assumption that both semicircles are placed at (r, r) and (R, R) is incorrect. 

Therefore, my initial approach is flawed. Let
