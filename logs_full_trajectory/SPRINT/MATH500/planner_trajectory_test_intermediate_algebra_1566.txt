Okay, so I need to find the sum a + b + c + d + e + f in terms of k, where d, e, f are the coefficients of the parabola obtained by reflecting the original parabola y = ax² + bx + c about the line y = k. The original parabola has vertex (h, k). Hmm, let me start by recalling some properties of parabolas and reflections.

First, the vertex form of a parabola is y = a(x - h)² + k, where (h, k) is the vertex. But the given equation is in standard form y = ax² + bx + c. Maybe I should convert the original equation to vertex form first to understand the reflection better.

<prompt_1.1> Convert the original parabola's equation from standard form to vertex form as per the above plan. </prompt_1.1>

Let me try that. 

So, starting with y = ax² + bx + c. The vertex form of a parabola is y = a(x - h)² + k, where h = -b/(2a) and k = c - b²/(4a). Wait, so the vertex (h, k) can be expressed in terms of a, b, c. But in the problem, the vertex is given as (h, k), so maybe I need to express h and k in terms of a, b, c? Or perhaps the other way around. Let me note that down.

Given the original parabola y = ax² + bx + c, the vertex is at (h, k) where h = -b/(2a) and k = c - b²/(4a). So that's the vertex. Now, reflecting this parabola about the line y = k. 

Reflection about a horizontal line y = k. How does reflecting a parabola about a horizontal line affect its equation?

Based on execution_1.1:
Let me think. If we reflect a graph over the line y = k, each point (x, y) on the original graph is mapped to (x, 2k - y) on the reflected graph. So, the reflection of the original parabola y = ax² + bx + c would be y = 2k - (ax² + bx + c). Let's compute that.

<prompt_2.1> Compute the reflected parabola's equation by reflecting y = ax² + bx + c over y = k as per the above plan. </prompt_2.1>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Starting with y = ax² + bx + c. Reflecting over y = k gives us y' = 2k - y. So substituting y from the original equation into this, we get y' = 2k - (ax² + bx + c). Therefore, the equation of the reflected parabola is y = -ax² - bx - c + 2k. 

Wait, but the problem states that the reflected parabola is y = dx² + ex + f. So comparing, we have:

d = -a

e = -b

f = -c + 2k

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Therefore, a + b + c + d + e + f would be a + b + c + (-a) + (-b) + (-c + 2k).

<prompt_3.1> Calculate the sum a + b + c + d + e + f using the expressions for d, e, and f as per the above plan. </prompt_3.1>

Wait, but let me check if this is correct. Because sometimes reflections can be tricky. Let me verify the reflection process again.

<prompt_3.2> Verify the reflection process and the result obtained for the sum a + b + c + d + e + f as per the above plan. </prompt_3.2>

But let me think again. Maybe there's a different way to approach this problem, just to confirm.

<prompt_3.3> Consider an alternative method to confirm the result of the sum a + b + c + d + e + f as per the above plan. </prompt_3.3>

But let me check with an example. Let's take a simple parabola and see if the result holds.

<prompt_3.4> Use a specific example to verify the result of the sum a + b + c + d + e + f as per the above plan. </prompt_3.4>

But let me try another example to be sure.

<prompt_3.5> Try another example to verify the result of the sum a + b + c + d + e + f as per the above plan. </prompt_3.5>

Wait, but let me think once more. Is there any step where I might have made an error? For instance, when reflecting the parabola, did I correctly compute the equation?

<prompt_3.6> Perform a final verification of the reflection process and the result as per the above plan. </prompt_3.6>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
Simplifying this: a - a + b - b + c - c + 2k = 0 + 0 + 0 + 2k = 2k. So the sum is 2k.

The reflection over y = k takes a point (x, y) to (x, 2k - y). Therefore, the original equation y = ax² + bx + c becomes, after reflection, y' = 2k - y. So substituting y from the original equation into this, we have y' = 2k - (ax² + bx + c). Therefore, rearranged, the equation is y = -ax² - bx - c + 2k. So yes, that gives d = -a, e = -b, f = -c + 2k. 

Therefore, adding a + b + c + d + e + f:

a + b + c + (-a) + (-b) + (-c + 2k) = (a - a) + (b - b) + (c - c) + 2k = 0 + 0 + 0 + 2k = 2k.

Alternatively, perhaps the reflection of the parabola about y = k can be found by considering the vertex. The original vertex is (h, k), and reflecting about the line y = k would map the vertex to itself, since it's on the line of reflection. Wait, that's interesting. So the vertex of the original parabola is (h, k), and reflecting about y = k would leave the vertex unchanged. 

But then, if the vertex remains the same, does that mean the reflected parabola has the same vertex? But that seems contradictory because reflecting the entire parabola over y = k should flip it vertically. Wait, but if the vertex is on the line of reflection, then the vertex remains the same, but the parabola is inverted. 

Wait, but in the original parabola, if the vertex is (h, k), then if a > 0, it opens upwards, and if a < 0, it opens downwards. After reflection over y = k, the parabola would still have the same vertex (h, k), but the direction would be reversed. So if the original parabola opens upwards (a > 0), the reflected one would open downwards (d < 0), and vice versa. 

But according to the reflection formula we derived earlier, the equation becomes y = -ax² - bx - c + 2k. So the coefficient d is -a, which makes sense because the parabola is inverted. The linear term remains the same? Wait, in the original parabola, the linear term is bx, and after reflection, it's still -bx? Wait, no. Wait, let's check again.

Original equation: y = ax² + bx + c. Reflecting over y = k gives y' = 2k - y. So substituting y = ax² + bx + c into this gives y' = 2k - ax² - bx - c. So the reflected equation is y = -ax² - bx + (2k - c). So the coefficients are:

d = -a

e = -b

f = 2k - c

Suppose we have a simple parabola with vertex at (0, k). Let's say k = 3. So the original parabola is y = a(x - 0)² + 3, which is y = ax² + 3. Then reflecting over y = 3 would leave the vertex at (0, 3), and the parabola would open downward if a was positive before. So the reflected parabola should be y = -ax² + 3. Let's see if that's the case according to the formula above.

Original equation: y = ax² + bx + c. Let's take the vertex at (0, 3). Then h = 0, so -b/(2a) = 0 => b = 0. So original equation is y = ax² + 3. Reflecting over y = 3, according to the reflection formula, would be y = -ax² - 0x - 3 + 2*3 = -ax² - 3 + 6 = -ax² + 3. Which matches our expectation. So the reflected equation is y = -ax² + 3, so d = -a, e = 0, f = 3. Then a + b + c + d + e + f = a + 0 + 3 + (-a) + 0 + 3 = 6. Which is 2*3 = 6. Correct. 

Another example: Let’s take a parabola that isn’t symmetric about the y-axis. Suppose original parabola is y = 2x² - 4x + 5. Let's find its vertex. h = -b/(2a) = 4/(4) = 1. Then k = 5 - (-4)^2/(4*2) = 5 - 16/8 = 5 - 2 = 3. So vertex is (1, 3). Reflecting over y = 3. The original equation is y = 2x² -4x +5. Reflecting over y = 3 would give y = -2x² +4x -5 + 2*3 = -2x² +4x -5 +6 = -2x² +4x +1. 

According to our formulas: d = -a = -2, e = -b = 4, f = -c +2k = -5 +6 =1. So reflected equation is y = -2x² +4x +1. Which matches. Then the sum a + b + c + d + e + f = 2 + (-4) +5 + (-2) +4 +1 = (2 -4 +5) + (-2 +4 +1) = 3 + 3 =6. Again, 2k =6. Perfect. 

Therefore, the formula seems to hold.

Suppose the original parabola is y = x², so a = 1, b = 0, c = 0. The vertex is at (0, 0). Reflecting over y = 0 (the x-axis) would give y = -x². So d = -1, e = 0, f = 0. Then a + b + c + d + e + f = 1 + 0 + 0 -1 + 0 + 0 = 0. According to the formula, 2k. Since the vertex is (0,0), k = 0, so 2k = 0. That matches. 

Another example: original parabola y = 2x² - 4x + 1. Let's find its vertex. h = -b/(2a) = 4/(4) = 1. k = c - b²/(4a) = 1 - (16)/(8) = 1 - 2 = -1. So vertex is (1, -1). Reflecting over y = -1. The original equation is y = 2x² -4x +1. Reflecting over y = -1 would give y = -2x² +4x -1 -2*1? Wait, let's compute it properly. 

Using the reflection formula: y' = 2*(-1) - (2x² -4x +1) = -2 -2x² +4x -1 = -2x² +4x -3. So the reflected equation is y = -2x² +4x -3. Therefore, d = -2, e =4, f = -3. Then a + b + c + d + e + f = 2 + (-4) +1 + (-2) +4 + (-3) = (2 -4 +1) + (-2 +4 -3) = (-1) + (-1) = -2. And 2k = 2*(-1) = -2. That also matches. 

So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, the answer is 2k.

Let's take the standard parabola y = ax² + bx + c. The reflection over y = k is obtained by reflecting each point (x, y) to (x, 2k - y). So the original equation y = ax² + bx + c becomes 2k - y = ax² + bx + c. Solving for y, we get y = 2k - ax² - bx - c. So yes, that's correct. Therefore, the reflected parabola is y = -ax² - bx - c + 2k. Therefore, coefficients are d = -a, e = -b, f = -c + 2k. 

Therefore, adding a + b + c + d + e + f = a + b + c -a -b -c + 2k = 0 + 2k = 2k. So the answer is 2k. Hmm, that seems straightforward. But let me check with another example to be thorough. 

Suppose the original parabola is y = x². So a = 1, b = 0, c = 0. The vertex is at (0, 0). Reflecting over y = 0 (the x-axis) would give y = -x². So d = -1, e = 0, f = 0. Then a + b + c + d + e + f = 1 + 0 + 0 -1 + 0 + 0 = 0. But according to the formula, 2k, since k = 0 here, so 2*0 = 0. That matches. 

Another example: original parabola y = x² + 2x + 1. This is (x + 1)^2, vertex at (-1, 0). So k = 0 here. Reflecting over y = 0. The original equation is y = x² + 2x + 1. Reflecting gives y = -x² - 2x -1 + 0? Wait, no. Wait, according to the formula, f = -c + 2k. Here, c = 1, so f = -1 + 2*0 = -1. So the reflected parabola is y = -x² -2x -1. Let's see, vertex is still at x = -1, plugging in: y = -(-1)^2 -2*(-1) -1 = -1 +2 -1 = 0. So vertex at (-1, 0), which is the reflection of the original vertex over y = 0. Correct. Then a + b + c + d + e + f: original a=1, b=2, c=1; reflected d=-1, e=-2, f=-1. Sum is 1+2+1-1-2-1 = 0. Which is 2k = 0. 

Another example where k is not zero. Let's take original parabola with vertex (h, k) = (1, 2). Let's say the original equation is y = a(x -1)^2 + 2. Let's choose a = 1, so y = (x -1)^2 + 2. Expanding this: y = x² - 2x + 1 + 2 = x² -2x +3. So a=1, b=-2, c=3. Reflecting over y = 2. The reflected parabola should be y = -1(x -1)^2 + 2. Expanding: y = - (x² - 2x +1) +2 = -x² + 2x -1 +2 = -x² + 2x +1. So d=-1, e=2, f=1. Now, sum a + b + c + d + e + f: 1 + (-2) +3 + (-1) +2 +1 = 1 -2 +3 -1 +2 +1 = (1-2) + (3-1) + (2+1) = (-1) + (2) + (3) = 4. And 2k = 2*2 =4. Correct. 

Therefore, the answer is 2k.
