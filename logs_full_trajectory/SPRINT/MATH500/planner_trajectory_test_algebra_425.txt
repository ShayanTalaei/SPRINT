Okay, so I need to solve the equation |x - 4| - 10 = 2 and find the product of all possible values of x. Let me start by understanding what this equation means. The absolute value function can sometimes make equations have two solutions, so maybe there are two values of x here. Let me work through it step by step.

First, I should isolate the absolute value term. The equation is |x - 4| - 10 = 2.
To isolate |x - 4|, I can add 10 to both sides.

So, adding 10 to both sides gives me |x - 4| = 12.

Now, the absolute value of something equals 12. That means the expression inside can be either 12 or -12.
So, I can split this into two separate equations: x - 4 = 12 and x - 4 = -12.

Let me solve each of these.

Starting with x - 4 = 12. Adding 4 to both sides, I get x = 16.

Then the second equation: x - 4 = -12. Adding 4 to both sides here gives x = -8.

So the two solutions are x = 16 and x = -8.
The problem asks for the product of all possible values of x. So I need to multiply 16 and -8 together.

Let me check that again. 16 times -8 is... 16 * 8 is 128, and since one is negative, the product is -128.

Wait, but let me verify if I did everything correctly. Let me substitute the values back into the original equation to make sure they work.

<prompt_1.1> Verify the solutions by substituting them back into the original equation. </prompt_1.1>

So the product is indeed -128.

Hmm, but just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way this could be approached. Maybe squaring both sides or something?

<prompt_1.2> Consider if there are alternative methods to solve the equation and confirm the solution. </prompt_1.2>

Alternatively, could there be only one solution? Suppose if the absolute value was zero, but here it's 12, which is positive, so there must be two solutions.
So I think my answer is correct.

First, let's check x = 16. Plugging into |16 - 4| - 10. That's |12| - 10, which is 12 - 10 = 2. That's correct.

Now x = -8. Plugging into |-8 - 4| - 10. That's |-12| - 10, which is 12 - 10 = 2. That also works.

<execution_1.2>
Let's see. If I have |x - 4| = 12, squaring both sides would give (x - 4)^2 = 144. Expanding that, x^2 - 8x + 16 = 144. Then x^2 - 8x + 16 - 144 = 0, so x^2 - 8x - 128 = 0. Factoring this quadratic, does it factor into (x - 16)(x + 8) = 0? Let's check: x * x = x^2, then 16 and -8 multiply to -128 and add to -8. Yes, 16 -8 = 8, but with the signs, it's (x -16)(x +8) = x^2 +8x -16x -128 = x^2 -8x -128. So the roots are 16 and -8, same as before. So the product of the roots of the quadratic equation is c/a, which here is -128/1 = -128. So that confirms the product is -128.

<Final_answer>
Therefore, the product of all possible values of $x$ is $\boxed{-128}$.
