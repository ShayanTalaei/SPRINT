Okay, so I need to find the range of the function f(x) = (arccos x)^2 + (arcsin x)^2. Hmm, let's start by recalling the domains and ranges of the arccos and arcsin functions. Both arccos x and arcsin x are defined for x in the interval [-1, 1]. So the domain of f(x) is also [-1, 1]. That means I only need to consider x values between -1 and 1.

Now, let's think about the ranges of arccos x and arcsin x.

<prompt_1.1> Determine the range of the function f(x) by considering the ranges of arccos x and arcsin x. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
The range of arccos x is [0, π], and the range of arcsin x is [-π/2, π/2], but actually, since x is in [-1, 1], arcsin x ranges from -π/2 to π/2. Wait, no, arcsin x is defined from -π/2 to π/2, but when x is in [-1, 1], arcsin x is in [-π/2, π/2]. However, arccos x is specifically in [0, π]. Also, there's a relationship between arccos x and arcsin x. I remember that arccos x + arcsin x = π/2. Let me verify that. If x is in [-1, 1], then yes, for example, if x = 1, arccos 1 = 0 and arcsin 1 = π/2, so 0 + π/2 = π/2. Similarly, if x = -1, arccos(-1) = π and arcsin(-1) = -π/2, so π + (-π/2) = π/2. So that identity holds. Therefore, arcsin x = π/2 - arccos x. So maybe I can express f(x) in terms of a single variable. Let's try that.

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Let me set θ = arccos x. Then, since arccos x + arcsin x = π/2, arcsin x = π/2 - θ. Therefore, f(x) can be written as θ² + (π/2 - θ)². Let's expand that.

<prompt_2.1> Simplify the expression for f(x) using the substitution θ = arccos x. </prompt_2.1>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
So θ² + (π/2 - θ)² = θ² + (π/2)² - πθ + θ² = 2θ² - πθ + (π/2)². So f(x) = 2θ² - πθ + π²/4. Now, θ is arccos x, which ranges from 0 to π. So θ ∈ [0, π]. Therefore, f(x) is a quadratic function in terms of θ, where θ is in [0, π]. Alternatively, maybe I can write this quadratic in terms of θ and find its minimum and maximum over the interval [0, π].

Based on execution_2.1:
Let me consider the quadratic function g(θ) = 2θ² - πθ + π²/4. To find its range over θ ∈ [0, π], I need to find its vertex and evaluate it at the endpoints.

But wait, let me check with specific values. Let's test x = 0.

<prompt_3.2> Verify the range by evaluating f(x) at specific points: x = 0, x = 1, and x = -1. </prompt_3.2>

But let me check another point. For example, take x = sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.707. Then arccos x = π/4, arcsin x = π/4, so f(x) = (π/4)^2 + (π/4)^2 = 2*(π²/16) = π²/8 ≈ 1.2337. Wait, but according to the previous conclusion, the minimum is π²/8 and the maximum is π²/4. So that's consistent.

Another test: x = -1/2.

<prompt_3.3> Further verify the range by evaluating f(x) at x = -1/2 and analyze the quadratic function's behavior. </prompt_3.3>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
The quadratic is in the form aθ² + bθ + c, where a = 2, b = -π, c = π²/4. Since a is positive, the parabola opens upwards, so the vertex is the minimum point. The vertex occurs at θ = -b/(2a) = π/(4). Let's check if θ = π/4 is within [0, π]. Yes, it is. So the minimum value of g(θ) is g(π/4) = 2*(π/4)^2 - π*(π/4) + π²/4. Let's compute that:

First term: 2*(π²/16) = π²/8

Second term: -π*(π/4) = -π²/4

Third term: π²/4

So adding them up: π²/8 - π²/4 + π²/4 = π²/8. So the minimum value is π²/8.

Now, the maximum value will occur at one of the endpoints of the interval [0, π]. Let's evaluate g(θ) at θ = 0 and θ = π.

At θ = 0: g(0) = 2*0 - 0 + π²/4 = π²/4 ≈ 2.4674

At θ = π: g(π) = 2*(π)^2 - π*(π) + π²/4 = 2π² - π² + π²/4 = π² + π²/4 = 5π²/4 ≈ 12.337

Wait, that seems like a big difference. Wait, let me check the calculation again.

Wait, θ is arccos x, so when θ = π, x = cos π = -1. When θ = 0, x = cos 0 = 1. So when x is 1, θ = 0, and when x is -1, θ = π. So evaluating g(θ) at θ = π:

g(π) = 2*(π)^2 - π*(π) + (π/2)^2. Wait, hold on, the original expression was 2θ² - πθ + π²/4. So substituting θ = π:

2*(π)^2 - π*(π) + π²/4 = 2π² - π² + π²/4 = (2π² - π²) + π²/4 = π² + π²/4 = (4π² + π²)/4 = 5π²/4. That's correct. So 5π²/4 is approximately (5*9.8696)/4 ≈ 49.348/4 ≈ 12.337. But when x = -1, let's compute f(x) directly.

If x = -1, arccos(-1) = π, arcsin(-1) = -π/2. So f(-1) = π² + (-π/2)^2 = π² + π²/4 = 5π²/4. That's correct. So that's the maximum value.

Similarly, when x = 1, arccos(1) = 0, arcsin(1) = π/2. So f(1) = 0 + (π/2)^2 = π²/4. That's the minimum value. Then, when θ = π/4, which corresponds to x = cos(π/4) = √2/2 ≈ 0.707, f(x) = π²/8. So that's the minimum.

Therefore, the range of f(x) is [π²/8, 5π²/4]. So the minimum value is π²/8 and the maximum is 5π²/4.

<execution_3.2>
Then arccos 0 = π/2, arcsin 0 = π/2. Wait, no. Wait, arcsin 0 is 0. Wait, no. Wait, arccos 0 is π/2, and arcsin 0 is 0. Wait, no, arcsin 0 is 0. Wait, yes. Because sin(0) = 0. So arcsin 0 = 0. Therefore, f(0) = (π/2)^2 + 0^2 = π²/4 ≈ 2.467. That's the upper bound.
</execution_3.2>

<execution_3.3>
Then arccos(-1/2) = 2π/3, arcsin(-1/2) = -π/6. Then f(x) = (2π/3)^2 + (-π/6)^2 = 4π²/9 + π²/36 = (16π² + π²)/36 = 17π²/36 ≈ 4.792. Which is between π²/8 ≈ 1.233 and π²/4 ≈ 2.467. Wait, 17π²/36 is approximately 4.792, which is actually larger than π²/4 (≈2.467). That can't be. Wait, that's a problem. Because according to our previous conclusion, the maximum is π²/4 ≈ 2.467, but this value is higher. So there must be a mistake here.

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.3:
Wait, let me check this. If x = -1/2, then arccos(-1/2) is 2π/3, and arcsin(-1/2) is -π/6. Then (2π/3)^2 + (-π/6)^2 = (4π²/9) + (π²/36) = (16π² + π²)/36 = 17π²/36 ≈ (17*9.8696)/36 ≈ 167.783/36 ≈ 4.66.

<prompt_4.1> Identify and correct the mistake in the reasoning about the range of f(x). </prompt_4.1>

Based on execution_3.2, execution_3.3:
Wait, but according to the previous quadratic analysis, the maximum should be at θ = π (x = -1), giving 5π²/4 ≈ 12.337. But here, when x = -1/2, which corresponds to θ = 2π/3, we get a value of 17π²/36 ≈ 4.66, which is less than 5π²/4. So that suggests that maybe the maximum is indeed at x = -1, but other points have lower values. So perhaps the quadratic function in θ has its maximum at θ = π, which is 5π²/4, and other θ values give lower values. So in that case, the maximum is at θ = π, which is x = -1. So then, why when I computed x = -1/2, I got a value of 17π²/36 ≈4.66, which is less than 5π²/4 ≈12.337. Wait, 17π²/36 is approximately 4.66, which is less than 5π²/4. So that's okay. So the maximum is indeed at x = -1, and other points have lower values. So the quadratic in θ, when θ increases from 0 to π, the function g(θ) first decreases to θ = π/4, then increases again? Wait, no, the quadratic is 2θ² - πθ + π²/4. Since the coefficient of θ² is positive, it's a parabola opening upwards, so it has a minimum at θ = π/4, and it increases as θ moves away from π/4 in both directions. Therefore, as θ goes from 0 to π, the function g(θ) will have its minimum at θ = π/4, and then increase as θ approaches 0 or π. Wait, but at θ = 0, g(0) = π²/4, and at θ = π, g(π) = 5π²/4, which is larger. Therefore, the maximum occurs at θ = π. So the function g(θ) attains its minimum at θ = π/4, and maximum at θ = π. So as θ moves from 0 to π/4, g(θ) decreases to the minimum, then increases from π/4 to π, where it reaches the maximum. Therefore, the range is from π²/8 to 5π²/4. Therefore, the initial calculation is correct.

But according to the previous conclusion, arccos(-1/2) is 2π/3, which is less than π, so according to the quadratic function, which is increasing for θ > π/4, since the vertex is at θ = π/4, then as θ increases beyond π/4, the function increases. So θ = 2π/3 is approximately 2.094, which is greater than π/4 (0.785), so the function is increasing there. Therefore, the value at θ = 2π/3 should be greater than the minimum, but less than the maximum at θ = π. But 17π²/36 ≈4.66 is less than 5π²/4 ≈12.337. So that's okay. So when θ approaches π, the function approaches 5π²/4, which is the maximum.

Based on execution_4.1:
Therefore, the range of f(x) is [π²/8, 5π²/4].

But let's verify this with another example. Let's take x = cos(π/3) = 1/2.

<prompt_5.1> Finalize and confirm the range of the function f(x) based on the analysis. </prompt_5.1>

Based on execution_4.1, execution_3.2, execution_3.3:
But let's check x = -1/2 again. x = -1/2, arccos(-1/2) = 2π/3, arcsin(-1/2) = -π/6. Then f(x) = (2π/3)^2 + (-π/6)^2 = 4π²/9 + π²/36 = 17π²/36 ≈4.66. So this is between π²/8 ≈1.233 and 5π²/4 ≈12.337, which is consistent.

Wait, but 17π²/36 is approximately 4.66, which is less than 5π²/4 ≈12.337. So the maximum is indeed at x = -1, and other points have lower values. So the range is [π²/8, 5π²/4].

Therefore, the answer should be that the range of f(x) is from π squared over eight to five pi squared over four, written as [π²/8, 5π²/4].

But let me check once more with another value. Let's take x = cos(π/6) = √3/2 ≈0.866. Then arccos x = π/6, arcsin x = π/2 - π/6 = π/3. Then f(x) = (π/6)^2 + (π/3)^2 = π²/36 + π²/9 = π²/36 + 4π²/36 = 5π²/36 ≈1.361. Which is still larger than π²/8 ≈1.233, so the minimum is indeed at θ = π/4 (x = √2/2).

Therefore, after thorough analysis, the range of f(x) is [π²/8, 5π²/4].

**Final Answer**
The range of \( f(x) \) is \(\boxed{\left[ \dfrac{\pi^2}{8}, \dfrac{5\pi^2}{4} \right]}\).

Then arccos(√2/2) = π/4, arcsin(√2/2) = π/4. So f(√2/2) = (π/4)^2 + (π/4)^2 = 2*(π²/16) = π²/8. That's the minimum. If x = -1, as before, we get 5π²/4. So seems consistent. Therefore, the range is from π²/8 to 5π²/4.

Therefore, the answer should be that the range of f(x) is [π²/8, 5π²/4].
