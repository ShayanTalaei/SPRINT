<Question>
Six witches and ten sorcerers are at an arcane mixer. The witches have decided to shake hands with each of the sorcerers. None of the witches bothered to shake each other's hands, since they are all good friends already, and the sorcerers all sort of hate each other and did not shake hands with other sorcerers. How many handshakes took place at the mixer?

Okay, let's see. The problem is about figuring out how many handshakes took place at an arcane mixer where there are six witches and ten sorcerers. The rules are that the witches each shake hands with all the sorcerers, but none of the witches shake hands with each other. Also, the sorcerers don't shake hands with each other either. I need to find the total number of handshakes that happened.

First, let me try to break down the problem.

<prompt_1.1> Break down the problem into parts to understand the scenario and identify the groups involved. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
There are two groups: witches and sorcerers. Witches only shake hands with sorcerers, and sorcerers only shake hands with witches. So, handshakes only occur between a witch and a sorcerer, not within the same group. That means the total number of handshakes is the sum of handshakes each witch does plus the sum of handshakes each sorcerer does. But wait, no, actually, since each handshake involves one witch and one sorcerer, we can calculate it as the number of interactions between the two groups. Let me think carefully here.

If each of the six witches shakes hands with each of the ten sorcerers, then for each witch, the number of handshakes they participate in is ten. So, for six witches, it would be 6 times 10. But wait, is there a possibility of double-counting here? Let me check.

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Suppose we take one witch. She shakes hands with ten sorcerers. Then another witch also shakes hands with ten sorcerers. Since the sorcerers are distinct individuals, each handshake between a witch and a sorcerer is unique. So, if we multiply the number of witches by the number of sorcerers, we get the total number of handshakes.

Alternatively, if we think of each sorcerer, each one shakes hands with six witches. So, each sorcerer has six handshakes. There are ten sorcerers, so 10 times 6.
Again, that would give 60.

So both methods give the same result, which is a good check.

Wait, but let me make sure there's no overlap or double-counting. Since a handshake is between a witch and a sorcerer, each handshake is being counted once from the witch's perspective and once from the sorcerer's perspective?
No, actually, each handshake is only counted once in each method. Let me clarify.

<prompt_2.1> Verify that there is no double-counting or overlap in the handshakes. </prompt_2.1>

So the answer should be 60.

Let me check with a smaller example.

<prompt_2.2> Check the solution with a smaller example to ensure its validity. </prompt_2.2>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
If we take the perspective of the witches: each of the 6 witches shakes hands with 10 sorcerers. Each handshake is with a unique sorcerer, so no overlap. So 6*10=60.

From the perspective of the sorcerers: each of the 10 sorcerers shakes hands with 6 witches. Each handshake is with a unique witch, so again, 10*6=60. Since each handshake involves one sorcerer and one witch, there's no overlap between the two groups, so there's no double-counting. Therefore, the total number of handshakes is indeed 6*10=60.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Suppose there are 2 witches and 3 sorcerers. Then each witch shakes hands with 3 sorcerers, so total handshakes would be 2*3=6. Alternatively, each sorcerer shakes hands with 2 witches, so 3*2=6. Correct. And if we list them: W1-S1, W1-S2, W1-S3, W2-S1, W2-S2, W2-S3. That's 6 handshakes.
</execution_2.2>
</Execution_2>

<Final_answer>
Therefore, the total number of handshakes that took place at the mixer is $\boxed{60}$.
