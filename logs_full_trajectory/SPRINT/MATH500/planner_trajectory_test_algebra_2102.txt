<Question>
Recently, Frank took a one-hundred question aptitude test where each correct answer scored $5$ points, each incorrect answer scored $-2$ points, and each question not answered scored zero points. Frank answered $80$ questions and scored $232$ points. How many questions did he answer correctly?

Okay, let's see. Frank took a 100-question aptitude test. Each correct answer gives 5 points, incorrect answers deduct 2 points, and unanswered questions give zero. He answered 80 questions and scored 232 points. The question is asking how many he answered correctly.

Hmm. Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, the total number of questions is 100. But Frank only answered 80. That means he left 20 questions unanswered. Since unanswered questions give zero, those 20 don't contribute anything. So the scoring is based only on the 80 he answered.

Let me denote the number of correct answers as 'c' and the number of incorrect answers as 'i'. Since he answered 80 questions in total, we can say that c + i = 80. That's our first equation.

Now, each correct answer gives 5 points, so the total points from correct answers would be 5c. Each incorrect answer deducts 2 points, so the total points lost from incorrect answers would be 2i. The total score is the points from correct answers minus the points lost from incorrect ones.
So the total score equation would be 5c - 2i = 232. That's our second equation.

So now we have a system of two equations:

1. c + i = 80
2. 5c - 2i = 232

We need to solve this system to find the value of c.

Let me think about how to solve this. The first equation can be rearranged to express one variable in terms of the other.

<prompt_1.1> Solve the system of equations to find the number of correct answers using substitution. </prompt_1.1>

But let me think again. Suppose someone made a different mistake. For example, maybe they thought the total number of questions is 100, and he answered 80, so 20 are blank.

<prompt_1.2> Consider potential mistakes in the reasoning and verify the solution by checking the total number of questions and the score calculation. </prompt_1.2>

Let me just verify the calculations once more.

If c = 52, then i = 28.

<prompt_1.3> Re-verify the solution by recalculating the score with c = 52 and i = 28. </prompt_1.3>

So I think that's the answer.
-----

But just to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using different variables or a different method.

<prompt_1.4> Explore alternative methods to solve the problem and confirm the solution. </prompt_1.4>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
For example, from the first equation, i = 80 - c. Then we can substitute this into the second equation. Let's try that.

Substitute i = 80 - c into the second equation:

5c - 2(80 - c) = 232

Let me expand that:

5c - 160 + 2c = 232

Wait, is that right? Wait, no. Wait, 5c - 2*(80 - c) would be 5c - 160 + 2c. Because the negative sign in front of the 2 would apply to both terms inside the parentheses. So 5c - 2*80 + 2*c. Which is 5c - 160 + 2c.
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
Then, maybe they set up equations with 80 as the total. But no, in the problem, Frank answered 80 questions. So the 80 is the total number he engaged with. So 80 = correct + incorrect, which is what we have. So that's right.

Alternatively, maybe someone could mix up the points. For example, thinking that incorrect answers give -2, but then maybe miscalculating the total. But in our equations, we correctly accounted for 5c - 2i. So that seems okay.

Another possible mistake could be in the arithmetic when solving the equations. Let me recheck that.

We had equation 1: c + i = 80. So i = 80 - c. Then substitute into equation 2:

5c - 2(80 - c) = 232.

Expanding that: 5c - 160 + 2c = 232.

Wait, hold on. Wait, -2*(80 - c) is -160 + 2c. So 5c + 2c - 160 = 232. That's 7c = 232 + 160 = 392. So 7c = 392. Therefore, c = 56. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, this gives a different result. Wait, did I make a mistake here? Wait, this contradicts the previous result.

Wait, no. Wait, let's check this step again. The equation after substitution is 5c - 2*(80 - c) = 232. Let's compute that carefully.
</execution_1.2>

<execution_1.3>
5*52 = 260, and 2*28 = 56. Then 260 - 56 = 204? Wait, no! Wait, 260 - 56 is 204? Wait, 260 minus 50 is 210, minus 6 is 204. Wait, but the score given is 232. Wait, that's not matching.
</execution_1.3>

<execution_1.4>
For example, suppose we let x be the number of correct answers and y be the number of incorrect ones. Then we have x + y = 80 and 5x - 2y = 232. Solving for x and y. The same system of equations. So substitution or elimination. Let's try elimination. Multiply the first equation by 2: 2x + 2y = 160. Then subtract that from the second equation: (5x -2y) - (2x +2y) = 232 -160. That gives 3x -4y =72. Wait, no, actually, if we subtract 2*(first equation) from the second equation:

5x -2y -2x -2y = 232 -160

Which simplifies to 3x -4y =72. Hmm, but we already have x + y =80. Maybe this approach is more complicated. Alternatively, from x + y =80, we can express y =80 -x. Then substitute into the second equation: 5x -2(80 -x)=232. Which is the same as before. So 5x -160 +2x =232, 7x=392, x=56. Wait, wait, that can't be. Wait, no. Wait, 5x -2*(80 -x) =232. Let's compute that again.

5x -2*(80 -x) =232

Multiply out the -2: 5x -160 +2x =232

Combine like terms: 7x -160 =232

Add 160 to both sides: 7x=392

x=56. Wait, that's different from before. Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, this is conflicting with the previous answer. Wait, no, hold on. Wait, if x is the number of correct answers, then in the previous substitution we had c as correct and i as incorrect. But here, using x as correct and y as incorrect. But the result here is x=56. Which contradicts the previous answer of 52. That can't be. So there's a mistake here. Wait, so which one is correct?

Wait, no, hold on. Wait, let's redo this. If we let x be correct, y be incorrect. Then x + y =80. Total score is 5x -2y=232. So substituting y=80 -x into the second equation: 5x -2*(80 -x)=232. Let's compute this again.

5x -160 +2x =232. Wait, 5x -2*(80 -x) is 5x -160 +2x? Wait, no. Wait, -2*(80 -x) is -160 +2x. So 5x + (-160 +2x) =7x -160. So 7x -160=232. Then 7x=232+160=392. x=392/7=56. So x=56. Wait, so this suggests 56 correct answers. But that contradicts the previous answer of 52. So there must be an error in one of the methods.

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Let's combine these terms.

5c + 2c - 160 = 232

Which is 7c - 160 = 232.

Now, we can solve for c. Let's add 160 to both sides:

<prompt_2.1> Solve the equation 7c - 160 = 232 for c. </prompt_2.1>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
7c = 232 + 160

232 + 160 is... let's see. 232 + 100 is 332, plus 60 is 392. So 7c = 392.

Then, divide both sides by 7:

c = 392 / 7

Hmm, what's 392 divided by 7? Let me calculate. 7*50=350, 392-350=42. 42/7=6. So 50 +6=56. So c=56.
</execution_2.1>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Wait, so c=56. Then i = 80 - c = 80 -56=24.

Wait, but let me check if that works.

<prompt_3.1> Verify the solution by checking if c=56 and i=24 satisfy both equations. </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
If he answered 56 correctly, each gives 5 points, so 56*5=280. Then 24 incorrect answers, each deducts 2 points, so 24*2=48. Then total score is 280 -48=232. Which matches the given score.
</execution_3.1>
</Execution_3>

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
Therefore, Frank answered 56 questions correctly.

Wait, but this contradicts my initial calculation where I thought c=52. Wait, no, maybe I confused the variables somewhere. Let me check again.

<prompt_4.1> Re-evaluate the solution and confirm if c=56 is correct. </prompt_4.1>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
Wait, no, wait. Wait, the user is asking for the number of correct answers. But according to this, c=56. But according to my initial calculation, I had a different answer. Wait, no, no. Wait, no, in the first part, I think I made a mistake. Let me check again.

Wait, in the problem statement, it's said that each correct answer is 5 points, each incorrect is -2, and unanswered is 0. Frank answered 80 questions, so 20 are unanswered. He scored 232. So the points come only from the 80 he answered. So total points = 5c -2i, where c +i=80. So solving gives c=56. Then 56 correct, 24 incorrect. Then 56*5=280, 24*2=48, 280-48=232.
</execution_4.1>
</Execution_4>

<Plan_5>
Based on execution_4.1:
So that seems correct. So why did I initially think 52? Maybe because of a miscalculation. Wait, let me check again.

<prompt_5.1> Verify the solution by re-evaluating the calculations for c and i. </prompt_5.1>
-----

But let me just verify once again. Let's assume 56 correct, 24 incorrect.

<prompt_5.2> Re-verify the solution by checking the total number of questions and the score calculation. </prompt_5.2>

But wait, in my initial solving, I thought c=52, but that was a miscalculation. So the correct answer is 56. So why did I doubt it earlier? Because maybe I confused the points. Let me check again.

<prompt_5.3> Confirm the correct solution and address any initial confusion. </prompt_5.3>
</Plan_5>

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
Wait, no. Wait, in the substitution step, 5c -2*(80 -c)=232. So 5c -160 +2c=232. Wait, that's 7c -160=232. Then 7c=232+160=392. c=392/7=56. So that's correct. So why did I think it was 52 earlier? Maybe because of a different problem. Hmm. So perhaps the answer is 56.
</execution_5.1>

<execution_5.2>
56*5=280, 24*2=48. 280-48=232. Correct. So that's the answer. So why did I initially get 52? Maybe because I miscalculated 392/7. Let me check 7*50=350, 7*56=392. 50+6=56. Yes, correct. So no, my initial answer was wrong. So the correct answer is 56.
</execution_5.2>

<execution_5.3>
Wait, let's see. If c=56, then points from correct answers: 56*5=280. Points lost from incorrect:24*2=48. Total score:280-48=232. Correct.

But initially, I thought of 52. Let me see why. Wait, maybe I miscalculated 392/7. Let me check 7*50=350, 392-350=42. 42/7=6. So 50+6=56. So that's correct. So 56 is the answer.

Wait, so why did I initially think 52? Maybe I confused the number of unanswered questions. Wait, no. Wait, perhaps a miscalculation in the total points. Wait, 56*5=280, 24*2=48. 280-48=232. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed to trick someone into thinking that all 100 are answered, but no. The problem clearly states he answered 80. So 20 blank. So the calculation is correct.

Therefore, the answer is 56. So I think I made a mistake earlier in my thinking process, but upon re-evaluating, 56 is correct.
