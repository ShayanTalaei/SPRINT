Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, Roslyn has ten boxes total. Out of these, five boxes have pencils, four have pens, and two have both pens and pencils. The question is asking how many boxes contain neither pens nor pencils.

Hmm, alright. Let me start by recalling some set theory principles. When dealing with groups that have overlaps, like boxes containing both pens and pencils here, the formula for the union of two sets is important.
The total number in either set is the sum of each set minus their intersection. So, the formula is |A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|.

In this case, set A could be the boxes with pencils, which is 5, and set B the boxes with pens, which is 4. The intersection, which is the boxes with both, is 2. So applying the formula, the total number of boxes with either pens or pencils or both would be 5 + 4 - 2.
Let me calculate that: 5 + 4 is 9, minus 2 is 7. So 7 boxes have either pens, pencils, or both.

But Roslyn has ten boxes in total. To find the number of boxes that have neither, we subtract the number of boxes that have either pens or pencils (or both) from the total number of boxes. That would be 10 - 7 = 3.

Wait, let me double-check. So, 5 boxes have pencils, 4 have pens, but 2 are counted in both. So if I just add 5 and 4, I get 9, but since 2 are duplicates, we subtract them once, leading to 7.
Then 10 total minus 7 gives 3. That seems right. But maybe I should break it down further to visualize.

Let's imagine the boxes. The ones with only pencils would be 5 total pencils boxes minus the 2 that also have pens, so 3 boxes with only pencils. The ones with only pens would be 4 total pens boxes minus the 2 that also have pencils, so 2 boxes with only pens. Then the ones with both are 2. So adding those up: 3 (only pencils) + 2 (only pens) + 2 (both) = 7.
Then 10 total minus 7 = 3 boxes with neither.

Alternatively, maybe using a Venn diagram.

I think that's the answer. Let me see if there's another way to approach it.

Two circles: one for pencils with 5 boxes, another for pens with 4 boxes. The overlap is 2. So the total in the pencils circle is 5, which includes the 2 that overlap. Similarly, pens circle has 4, with 2 overlapping. So non-overlapping parts would be 5 - 2 = 3 for pencils, and 4 - 2 = 2 for pens. Then adding the overlapping 2, we get 3 + 2 + 2 = 7. Again, 10 - 7 = 3.

<execution_1.2>
Maybe using the principle of inclusion-exclusion? Wait, that's essentially what I did earlier. The inclusion-exclusion principle is exactly for avoiding double-counting when there's an overlap. So since we know the overlap, we subtract it once.

<Final_answer>
Therefore, the number of boxes that contain neither pens nor pencils is $\boxed{3}$.
