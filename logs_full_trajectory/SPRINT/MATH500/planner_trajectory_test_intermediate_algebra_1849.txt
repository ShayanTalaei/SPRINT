<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to find the number of integer values of k between -500 and 500 inclusive, such that the equation log(kx) = 2 log(x + 2) has exactly one real solution. Hmm, let's start by understanding the equation step by step.

<prompt_1.1> Understand the given equation and determine the conditions for x and k. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
First, logarithmic equations can be tricky because of their domains. The arguments inside the logarithms must be positive. So, for log(kx) to be defined, kx must be positive. Similarly, for 2 log(x + 2) to be defined, x + 2 must be positive, which means x > -2. Also, since the right side is 2 log(x + 2), that's equivalent to log((x + 2)^2). So maybe I can rewrite the equation using logarithm properties to make it easier.

Let me write the equation again:
log(kx) = 2 log(x + 2)

Using the power rule for logarithms, 2 log(x + 2) becomes log((x + 2)^2). So the equation becomes:
log(kx) = log((x + 2)^2)

If the logarithms are equal, then their arguments must be equal (assuming the same base, which I think is standard). So:
kx = (x + 2)^2

But we also have to remember the domain restrictions. From log(kx), we have kx > 0, and from log(x + 2), we have x + 2 > 0 => x > -2. So x must be greater than -2, and kx must be positive. So depending on the sign of k, x must be positive if k is positive, or x must be negative if k is negative. But since x > -2, if k is negative, x has to be between -2 and 0. Wait, because if k is negative, then kx > 0 implies x < 0, but x > -2. So x is in (-2, 0) if k is negative. If k is positive, then x must be positive (since x > -2 and kx > 0, so x > 0).

Based on execution_1.1:
So, the equation reduces to kx = (x + 2)^2, with domain considerations based on k. Let's write that quadratic equation:

<prompt_2.1> Solve the quadratic equation derived from the logarithmic equation and determine the domain conditions. </prompt_2.1>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
(x + 2)^2 - kx = 0
Expanding the left side:
x^2 + 4x + 4 - kx = 0
Combine like terms:
x^2 + (4 - k)x + 4 = 0

So, quadratic equation in x: x^2 + (4 - k)x + 4 = 0
</execution_2.1>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Now, we need to find the integer values of k in [-500, 500] such that this quadratic equation has exactly one real solution that satisfies the domain conditions.

But wait, the original equation is a logarithmic equation, which is only defined when kx > 0 and x + 2 > 0 (so x > -2). So even if the quadratic equation has two solutions, we have to check which of those solutions satisfy the domain restrictions. The problem states that the original equation has exactly one real solution. Therefore, the quadratic equation must have two solutions, but only one of them satisfies the domain conditions. Alternatively, the quadratic equation could have exactly one solution that lies within the domain. So, two cases: either the quadratic has a repeated root that is within the domain, or the quadratic has two distinct roots but only one is within the domain.

First, let's find the discriminant of the quadratic equation to check when it has real solutions.

Quadratic equation: x^2 + (4 - k)x + 4 = 0
Discriminant D = [-(4 - k)]^2 - 4 * 1 * 4 = (4 - k)^2 - 16

<prompt_3.1> Calculate the discriminant of the quadratic equation and determine when it is a perfect square. </prompt_3.1>
-----

But we need to check if x is in the appropriate domain based on k. Let's re-express x in terms of k.

<prompt_3.2> Analyze the domain conditions for k > 0 and k < 0 and determine the number of integer k values. </prompt_3.2>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
Calculating:
(16 - 8k + k^2) - 16 = k^2 - 8k

So D = k^2 - 8k

For the quadratic to have real solutions, D must be non-negative:
k^2 - 8k ≥ 0
k(k - 8) ≥ 0

This inequality holds when k ≤ 0 or k ≥ 8.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
Case 1: k > 0

Here, x must be positive (since kx > 0 and x > -2). So, any solution x must be positive.

Case 2: k < 0

Here, x must be negative (since kx > 0 implies x < 0) but x > -2. So x is in (-2, 0).

Case 3: k = 0

Wait, k = 0 is allowed since the interval is [-500,500]. Let's check k = 0.

If k = 0, the original equation becomes log(0 * x) = log(0), which is undefined. So k = 0 is invalid. So k cannot be zero.

Therefore, k ranges from -500 to -1 and 1 to 500.

Now, back to Case 1: k > 0. Then x must be positive. The quadratic equation x^2 + (4 - k)x + 4 = 0. Let's analyze the roots.

If the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots, but only one is positive, then the original equation will have exactly one solution. Alternatively, if there's a repeated positive root, that also counts as one solution.

Similarly, for k < 0, the quadratic equation's roots must have exactly one root in (-2, 0).

So, first, let's handle Case 1: k > 0.

For k > 0, x must be positive. Let's find the roots:

x = [-(4 - k) ± sqrt(D)] / 2 = [k - 4 ± sqrt((k - 4)^2 - 16)] / 2

Simplify sqrt((k - 4)^2 - 16). Let's denote D = (k - 4)^2 - 16.

So D = (k - 4)^2 - 16 = (k - 4 - 4)(k - 4 + 4) = (k - 8)(k). Wait, that's factoring the difference of squares: a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b). So here, a = (k - 4), b = 4. Therefore, D = (k - 4 - 4)(k - 4 + 4) = (k - 8)(k). So discriminant D = k(k - 8).

Therefore, discriminant D = k(k - 8). For the quadratic to have real roots, D ≥ 0. So k(k - 8) ≥ 0. Since k > 0 in this case, the inequality k(k - 8) ≥ 0 holds when k - 8 ≥ 0, i.e., k ≥ 8. Because k is positive, so the product is non-negative when both factors are non-negative or both are non-positive. But k > 0, so k - 8 ≥ 0 => k ≥ 8. If k were between 0 and 8, then k is positive and k - 8 is negative, so the product is negative. Therefore, for k > 0, discriminant is non-negative only when k ≥ 8. Therefore, when k ≥ 8, the quadratic has real roots, otherwise, no real roots. Therefore, for k > 0, only when k ≥ 8 can the equation have real solutions. Now, when k ≥ 8, the quadratic equation has two real roots. Let's check if these roots are positive.

Given that x must be positive (since k > 0), we need to check whether the quadratic equation has one or two positive roots.

The quadratic equation is x^2 + (4 - k)x + 4 = 0. Let's denote the quadratic as x^2 + bx + c = 0, where b = 4 - k and c = 4.

For the quadratic equation, the sum of roots is -b = k - 4, and the product of roots is c = 4.

Since the product of roots is 4, which is positive, both roots have the same sign. Since their sum is k - 4. If k - 4 is positive, then both roots are positive. If k - 4 is negative, both roots are negative. But in our case, for k ≥ 8, k - 4 ≥ 4, which is positive. Therefore, both roots are positive. However, the quadratic equation when k ≥ 8 has two positive roots. But we need to check if both roots are distinct or if there's a repeated root. Since discriminant D = k(k - 8). When k = 8, D = 8*(0) = 0, so there's a repeated root. For k > 8, D > 0, so two distinct roots.

But the original equation log(kx) = 2 log(x + 2) would require that x satisfies both the quadratic equation and the domain conditions. So, in the case of k > 0, x must be positive. So if there's a repeated root, that's one solution. If there are two distinct roots, but both are positive, then the original equation would have two solutions. However, the problem states that the equation must have exactly one real solution. Therefore, in the case of k > 0, we need to have either a repeated root (i.e., k = 8) or have both roots positive but only one of them satisfies the original logarithmic equation. Wait, but how could that happen? Because if both roots are positive, then both would satisfy the domain x > -2 (since x > 0 in this case). Therefore, unless one of the roots does not satisfy the original equation. Wait, but the original equation reduces to the quadratic equation, so both roots would satisfy the equation, provided they are in the domain. Therefore, if both roots are positive, then both are valid solutions. Therefore, for k > 8, there are two solutions, which we don't want. For k = 8, there's one solution (repeated root). Therefore, only k = 8 in this case gives exactly one solution.

Wait, but wait. Let me check.

<prompt_4.1> Verify the analysis for k > 0 and determine if k = 8 is the only valid value. </prompt_4.1>

But let's check for k = 8. Then the quadratic equation becomes x^2 + (4 - 8)x + 4 = x^2 -4x +4 = 0, which factors to (x - 2)^2 = 0. So x = 2. Then check if x = 2 satisfies the original equation.

<prompt_4.2> Verify the solution for k = 8 in the original equation. </prompt_4.2>

Now, moving to Case 2: k < 0.

Here, x must be in (-2, 0). Let's analyze the quadratic equation x^2 + (4 - k)x + 4 = 0.

<prompt_4.3> Analyze the quadratic equation for k < 0 and determine the conditions for a unique solution. </prompt_4.3>

Based on execution_3.2:
But let's check if there are other possibilities where the quadratic equation might have one positive root and one negative root. Wait, but earlier we saw that for k > 0, the product of roots is 4, which is positive, so both roots have the same sign. Similarly, for k < 0, let's check the product of roots.

<prompt_4.6> Verify the analysis for k < 0 and confirm if k = -4 is the only valid value. </prompt_4.6>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
Wait, maybe there's a mistake here. Let's think again.

Wait, the quadratic equation is x^2 + (4 - k)x + 4 = 0. For k > 8, discriminant is positive, so two distinct real roots. Since the product of roots is 4 (positive), both roots have the same sign. The sum of roots is k - 4. Since k > 8, sum is k - 4 > 4, which is positive. Therefore, both roots are positive. Therefore, both roots are valid in the domain x > 0. Therefore, the original equation would have two solutions, which is not desired. So for k > 8, two solutions. For k = 8, one solution (repeated root). For 0 < k < 8, discriminant is negative, so no real solutions. Therefore, in the k > 0 case, only k = 8 gives exactly one solution.
</execution_4.1>

<execution_4.2>
Original equation: log(8*2) = log(16) and 2 log(2 + 2) = 2 log(4) = log(16). So yes, equal. Therefore, k = 8 gives exactly one solution. For k > 8, two solutions. For k < 8 but k ≥ 8, which is only k = 8. Wait, k must be integer. So k = 8 is the only integer in k ≥ 8 where the quadratic has a repeated root. For k = 9, discriminant is 9*1 = 9, which is positive, so two distinct positive roots. Therefore, two solutions. So only k = 8 in this case gives exactly one solution.
</execution_4.2>

<execution_4.3>
Again, product of roots is 4 (same as before), so both roots are either positive or both negative. But since x must be in (-2, 0) for k < 0, we need to check if the quadratic equation has roots in that interval.

So for k < 0, x must be in (-2, 0). Let's analyze the quadratic equation x^2 + (4 - k)x + 4 = 0.

Since k is negative, 4 - k is 4 + |k|, so 4 - k is greater than 4. So the coefficient of x is positive. Let's denote the quadratic as x^2 + (4 - k)x + 4 = 0.

Again, discriminant D = (4 - k)^2 - 16 = k^2 - 8k. For k < 0, D = k(k - 8). Since k is negative, and k - 8 is also negative (because k < 0 < 8), so D is positive (negative times negative). Therefore, for k < 0, discriminant is positive, so two distinct real roots. Now, the product of roots is 4, which is positive, so both roots have the same sign. Since x must be in (-2, 0), which is negative, we need both roots to be negative. But since their product is positive, both are negative. So, for k < 0, quadratic equation has two negative roots. But we need to check if these roots are in (-2, 0).

So, let's find the roots:

x = [-(4 - k) ± sqrt(D)] / 2 = [k - 4 ± sqrt(k^2 - 8k)] / 2

Wait, since k is negative, let's denote k = -m where m > 0. Then, substituting k = -m:

x = [ -m - 4 ± sqrt( (-m)^2 - 8*(-m) ) ] / 2
= [ -m - 4 ± sqrt(m^2 + 8m) ] / 2

So sqrt(m^2 + 8m) is positive. Let's analyze the two roots:

First root: [ -m - 4 + sqrt(m^2 + 8m) ] / 2

Second root: [ -m - 4 - sqrt(m^2 + 8m) ] / 2

Let's compute the first root:

Numerator: -m -4 + sqrt(m^2 + 8m)

Let me see if this is positive or negative. Let's compute sqrt(m^2 + 8m):

sqrt(m^2 + 8m) = sqrt(m(m + 8)). Since m > 0, this is greater than m, because m(m + 8) > m^2. So sqrt(m^2 + 8m) > m.

Therefore, -m -4 + sqrt(m^2 + 8m) > -m -4 + m = -4. So the numerator is greater than -4. Since the denominator is 2, the first root is greater than -2. But we need to check if it's less than 0.

Similarly, second root:

Numerator: -m -4 - sqrt(m^2 + 8m). This is definitely negative, since all terms are negative. So the second root is negative.

So for k < 0 (i.e., m > 0), we have two roots:

First root: [ -m -4 + sqrt(m^2 + 8m) ] / 2

Second root: [ -m -4 - sqrt(m^2 + 8m) ] / 2

We need to check if the first root is greater than -2 and less than 0, and the second root is also less than 0. But since both roots are negative, but we need to check if they are in (-2, 0).

First, check the second root:

Second root: [ -m -4 - sqrt(m^2 + 8m) ] / 2

Since sqrt(m^2 + 8m) > m, so -m -4 - sqrt(m^2 + 8m) < -m -4 - m = -2m -4. Since m > 0, this is less than -4. Therefore, the numerator is less than -4, so divided by 2, the second root is less than -2. Therefore, the second root is less than -2, which is outside the domain x > -2. Therefore, the second root is invalid. The first root is [ -m -4 + sqrt(m^2 + 8m) ] / 2. Let's check if this is greater than -2 and less than 0.

First, check if it's greater than -2:

[ -m -4 + sqrt(m^2 + 8m) ] / 2 > -2

Multiply both sides by 2:

-m -4 + sqrt(m^2 + 8m) > -4

Add m +4 to both sides:

sqrt(m^2 + 8m) > m + 0

But sqrt(m^2 + 8m) = sqrt(m(m + 8)) which is greater than m, since m +8 > m. Therefore, sqrt(m^2 + 8m) > m, so sqrt(m^2 + 8m) > m, so sqrt(m^2 + 8m) > m. Therefore, sqrt(m^2 + 8m) > m implies sqrt(m^2 + 8m) > m. So, sqrt(m^2 + 8m) > m, so sqrt(m^2 + 8m) > m. Therefore, sqrt(m^2 + 8m) > m, so the inequality sqrt(m^2 + 8m) > m is true. Therefore, the first root is greater than -2.

Now, check if the first root is less than 0:

[ -m -4 + sqrt(m^2 + 8m) ] / 2 < 0

Multiply both sides by 2:

-m -4 + sqrt(m^2 + 8m) < 0

Rearrange:

sqrt(m^2 + 8m) < m + 4

Square both sides (since both sides are positive):

m^2 + 8m < (m + 4)^2

Expand the right side:

m^2 + 8m < m^2 + 8m + 16

Subtract m^2 + 8m from both sides:

0 < 16

Which is true. Therefore, sqrt(m^2 + 8m) < m + 4 is true, so the inequality holds. Therefore, the first root is less than 0. Therefore, the first root is in (-2, 0). Therefore, for k < 0, the quadratic equation has one root in (-2, 0) and another root less than -2, which is invalid. Therefore, for k < 0, there is exactly one valid solution (the first root) in the domain. Therefore, for all k < 0, the original equation has exactly one real solution.
</execution_4.3>

<execution_4.4>
Then discriminant D = 8*(8 - 8) = 0. So there's a repeated root. The root is x = [k - 4 ± 0]/2 = (8 - 4)/2 = 4/2 = 2. So x = 2. Check if x = 2 is in the domain. Since k = 8 > 0, x must be positive, and 2 > 0, so it's valid. Therefore, x = 2 is a valid solution. So k = 8 is valid. Now, check if x = 2 satisfies the original equation.

Original equation: log(8*2) = log(16) and 2 log(2 + 2) = 2 log(4) = log(16). So yes, both sides are equal. So k = 8 is valid.
</execution_4.4>

<execution_4.5>
When k = 8, discriminant D = 8*(8 - 8) = 0, so there's one real root (repeated). The root is x = [-(4 - 8) ± 0]/2 = (4)/2 = 2. So x = 2. Check if x = 2 is in the domain. For k = 8, which is positive, x must be positive, which it is. So x = 2 is valid. Therefore, k = 8 gives exactly one solution. For k > 8, discriminant D = k(k - 8) > 0, so two distinct real roots. As mentioned, both roots are positive because the sum of roots is k - 4, which is positive (since k > 8), and product is 4. Therefore, two positive roots. Therefore, for k > 8, the quadratic equation has two positive roots, so the original equation would have two solutions. But we need exactly one solution. Therefore, these k values (k > 8) are invalid. Therefore, in the case of k > 0, only k = 8 gives exactly one solution.

Subcase 2: k < 0

Here, x must be in (-2, 0). Let's analyze the quadratic equation x^2 + (4 - k)x + 4 = 0. Let's compute the discriminant D = k(k - 8). Since k < 0, and k - 8 is also negative (because k < 0 < 8), so D = k(k - 8) is positive (negative times negative). Therefore, discriminant is positive, so two distinct real roots. However, we need to check if these roots lie in (-2, 0).

So, for k < 0, quadratic equation has two real roots. Let's denote them as x1 and x2. We need to check if exactly one of them is in (-2, 0). Alternatively, both could be in (-2, 0), but then the original equation would have two solutions, which we don't want. So we need to find k < 0 such that either one or both roots are in (-2, 0). However, since we need exactly one solution, we need exactly one root in (-2, 0). Let's analyze the quadratic equation for k < 0.

First, let's denote the quadratic equation as x^2 + (4 - k)x + 4 = 0. Let's compute the roots:

x = [-(4 - k) ± sqrt(k(k - 8))]/2 = [k - 4 ± sqrt(k(k - 8))]/2

Since k is negative, let's denote k = -m where m > 0. Then, substituting k = -m:

x = [-m - 4 ± sqrt(-m(-m - 8))]/2 = [ - (m + 4) ± sqrt(m(m + 8)) ] / 2

So, the roots are:

x1 = [ - (m + 4) + sqrt(m(m + 8)) ] / 2

x2 = [ - (m + 4) - sqrt(m(m + 8)) ] / 2

Since m > 0, let's analyze x1 and x2.

First, sqrt(m(m + 8)) is positive. Let's see:

For x1: numerator is - (m + 4) + sqrt(m(m + 8))

For x2: numerator is - (m + 4) - sqrt(m(m + 8)), which is more negative.

So x2 is definitely negative, and x1 could be positive or negative. Let's check if x1 is positive or negative.

Compute the numerator of x1:

- (m + 4) + sqrt(m(m + 8))

Let's square both sides to see when this is positive. Let me denote S = sqrt(m(m + 8)).

Then, S > m + 4 ?

Is sqrt(m(m + 8)) > m + 4 ?

Square both sides:

m(m + 8) > (m + 4)^2

Left side: m^2 + 8m

Right side: m^2 + 8m + 16

Therefore, m^2 + 8m > m^2 + 8m + 16 => 0 > 16, which is false. Therefore, sqrt(m(m + 8)) < m + 4. Therefore, the numerator of x1 is negative. Therefore, both x1 and x2 are negative. So both roots are negative. But since k < 0, x must be in (-2, 0). Therefore, we need to check if both roots are in (-2, 0) or only one.

So, let's check the roots:

First, x1 = [ - (m + 4) + sqrt(m(m + 8)) ] / 2

We need to check if x1 > -2 and x1 < 0. Similarly for x2.

First, x2 is [ - (m + 4) - sqrt(m(m + 8)) ] / 2. Since both terms in the numerator are negative, x2 is negative. Let's check if x2 > -2.

x2 > -2 ?

[ - (m + 4) - sqrt(m(m + 8)) ] / 2 > -2

Multiply both sides by 2:

- (m + 4) - sqrt(m(m + 8)) > -4

Multiply both sides by -1 (reverse inequality):

(m + 4) + sqrt(m(m + 8)) < 4

But m + 4 + sqrt(m(m + 8)) < 4

Subtract 4:

m + sqrt(m(m + 8)) < 0

But m > 0, sqrt(m(m + 8)) > 0, so left side is positive, which is less than 0? No. Therefore, x2 < -2. Therefore, x2 is not in the domain (-2, 0). Therefore, x2 is invalid.

Now check x1:

x1 = [ - (m + 4) + sqrt(m(m + 8)) ] / 2

We need to check if x1 > -2 and x1 < 0.

First, x1 < 0:

As established earlier, since sqrt(m(m + 8)) < m + 4, the numerator is negative, so x1 < 0.

Now check x1 > -2:

[ - (m + 4) + sqrt(m(m + 8)) ] / 2 > -2

Multiply both sides by 2:

- (m + 4) + sqrt(m(m + 8)) > -4

Rearrange:

sqrt(m(m + 8)) > (m + 4) - 4

sqrt(m(m + 8)) > m

Is sqrt(m(m + 8)) > m ?

Square both sides:

m(m + 8) > m^2

Left side: m^2 + 8m > m^2 => 8m > 0, which is true since m > 0. Therefore, sqrt(m(m + 8)) > m. Therefore, sqrt(m(m + 8)) - m > 0.

Therefore, sqrt(m(m + 8)) - m = [sqrt(m(m + 8)) - m] * [sqrt(m(m + 8)) + m] / [sqrt(m(m + 8)) + m] = [m(m + 8) - m^2] / [sqrt(m(m + 8)) + m] = [8m] / [sqrt(m(m + 8)) + m] > 0

Therefore, sqrt(m(m + 8)) - m is positive. Therefore, sqrt(m(m + 8)) > m. Therefore, sqrt(m(m + 8)) - m > 0. Therefore, the numerator sqrt(m(m + 8)) - m is positive. Therefore, [sqrt(m(m + 8)) - m] > 0.

Therefore, sqrt(m(m + 8)) - m > 0 => sqrt(m(m + 8)) > m.

Therefore, sqrt(m(m + 8)) - m = (sqrt(m(m + 8)) - m) * [sqrt(m(m + 8)) + m] / [sqrt(m(m + 8)) + m] = [m(m + 8) - m^2] / [sqrt(m(m + 8)) + m] = 8m / [sqrt(m(m + 8)) + m] > 0.

Therefore, sqrt(m(m + 8)) - m = 8m / [sqrt(m(m + 8)) + m]

Therefore, sqrt(m(m + 8)) - m = 8m / [sqrt(m(m + 8)) + m]

Therefore, sqrt(m(m + 8)) = m + 8m / [sqrt(m(m + 8)) + m]

But maybe that's complicating things. Let's get back to x1 > -2.

We have:

sqrt(m(m + 8)) > m

Which is true, as shown. Therefore:

sqrt(m(m + 8)) - m > 0

Therefore:

sqrt(m(m + 8)) - m = 8m / [sqrt(m(m + 8)) + m] as shown earlier.

Therefore, sqrt(m(m + 8)) - m = 8m / [sqrt(m(m + 8)) + m]

But let's denote this as A = 8m / [sqrt(m(m + 8)) + m]. Then, sqrt(m(m + 8)) - m = A.

Therefore, sqrt(m(m + 8)) = m + A.

But perhaps this is not helpful.

Alternatively, let's compute sqrt(m(m + 8)) - m:

sqrt(m^2 + 8m) - m

Multiply and divide by sqrt(m^2 + 8m) + m:

[sqrt(m^2 + 8m) - m][sqrt(m^2 + 8m) + m] / [sqrt(m^2 + 8m) + m] = (m^2 + 8m - m^2) / [sqrt(m^2 + 8m) + m] = 8m / [sqrt(m^2 + 8m) + m]

Therefore, sqrt(m(m + 8)) - m = 8m / [sqrt(m(m + 8)) + m]

Therefore, sqrt(m(m + 8)) - m = 8m / [sqrt(m(m + 8)) + m]

Therefore, sqrt(m(m + 8)) = m + 8m / [sqrt(m(m + 8)) + m]

But this seems recursive. Let's instead find an expression for sqrt(m(m + 8)) - m:

Let’s denote t = sqrt(m(m + 8)) - m

Then t = sqrt(m^2 + 8m) - m

Multiply both sides by sqrt(m^2 + 8m) + m:

t(sqrt(m^2 + 8m) + m) = 8m

Therefore, t = 8m / [sqrt(m^2 + 8m) + m]

But this might not help directly. Let's instead see if we can find when sqrt(m(m + 8)) - m > 2.

Wait, we need sqrt(m(m + 8)) - m > 2 to have x1 > -2.

Wait, x1 = [ - (m + 4) + sqrt(m(m + 8)) ] / 2 > -2

Which simplifies to sqrt(m(m + 8)) - m > 0, which we already know is true. But we need sqrt(m(m + 8)) - m > 2?

Wait, let's re-express the inequality:

[ - (m + 4) + sqrt(m(m + 8)) ] / 2 > -2

Multiply both sides by 2:

- (m + 4) + sqrt(m(m + 8)) > -4

Then:

sqrt(m(m + 8)) > m + 4 - 4

sqrt(m(m + 8)) > m

But we already know sqrt(m(m + 8)) > m. So this inequality is always true. Wait, but that seems conflicting. Wait, let's re-express:

Wait, starting from:

[ - (m + 4) + sqrt(m(m + 8)) ] / 2 > -2

Multiply both sides by 2:

- (m + 4) + sqrt(m(m + 8)) > -4

Add (m + 4) to both sides:

sqrt(m(m + 8)) > (m + 4) - 4

sqrt(m(m + 8)) > m

Which is true as we saw earlier. Therefore, this inequality is always true. Therefore, x1 > -2.

But wait, that can't be. Because if sqrt(m(m +8)) > m, then sqrt(m(m +8)) - m is positive, so [sqrt(m(m +8)) - m] / 2 > 0. But we need x1 > -2.

Wait, but according to the previous steps, the inequality reduces to sqrt(m(m +8)) > m, which is true, so x1 > -2 is automatically satisfied. Therefore, x1 is in (-2, 0) only if x1 < 0, which it is. Wait, but x1 is [ - (m + 4) + sqrt(m(m +8)) ] / 2. Since sqrt(m(m +8)) < m +4 (as shown earlier), the numerator is negative, so x1 is negative. But we need to check if x1 > -2.

So:

x1 > -2

[ - (m + 4) + sqrt(m(m +8)) ] / 2 > -2

Multiply by 2:

- (m + 4) + sqrt(m(m +8)) > -4

Add (m + 4) to both sides:

sqrt(m(m +8)) > m

Which is true, as sqrt(m(m +8)) = sqrt(m^2 + 8m) > sqrt(m^2) = m. Therefore, sqrt(m(m +8)) > m, so this inequality holds. Therefore, x1 > -2.

But x1 is negative, so x1 is in (-2, 0). Therefore, x1 is a valid solution. However, x2 is less than -2, so invalid. Therefore, for k < 0, the quadratic equation has exactly one solution in the domain (-2, 0). Therefore, for each k < 0, there is exactly one solution. Therefore, all k < 0 would result in exactly one solution. But wait, is that correct?

Wait, but let's check with specific values. Let's take k = -4.
</execution_4.5>

<execution_4.6>
Let's see: For k < 0, the quadratic equation is x^2 + (4 - k)x + 4 = 0. The product of the roots is c = 4, which is positive, so again, both roots have the same sign. However, since k < 0, the sum of the roots is k - 4, which is negative (since k is negative). Therefore, sum of roots is negative, and product is positive, so both roots are negative. But in this case, x must be in (-2, 0). So, if both roots are negative, but need to be greater than -2. So, need to check if both roots are in (-2, 0), or only one is.

Therefore, for k < 0, quadratic equation has two real roots (since discriminant D = k(k - 8). For k < 0, k is negative, k - 8 is also negative, so D = positive. Therefore, two distinct real roots. Both roots are negative (since product is positive and sum is negative). So, we need to check if these roots are greater than -2.

So, for k < 0, quadratic equation has two negative roots. Let's find the roots:

x = [k - 4 ± sqrt(k(k - 8))]/2

But k is negative, so let's denote k = -m where m > 0. Then:

x = [-m - 4 ± sqrt(-m(-m - 8))]/2

Simplify sqrt(-m(-m -8)) = sqrt(m(m + 8))

So, x = [ - (m + 4) ± sqrt(m(m + 8)) ] / 2

Since m > 0, sqrt(m(m + 8)) is positive. Let's analyze the two roots:

First root: [ - (m + 4) + sqrt(m(m + 8)) ] / 2

Second root: [ - (m + 4) - sqrt(m(m + 8)) ] / 2

We need to check if these roots are greater than -2.

Let me compute the first root:

Numerator: - (m + 4) + sqrt(m(m + 8))

Let's see if this is greater than -2 * 2 = -4 (since denominator is 2). Wait, actually, to check if x > -2, we can compute:

[ - (m + 4) + sqrt(m(m + 8)) ] / 2 > -2

Multiply both sides by 2:

- (m + 4) + sqrt(m(m + 8)) > -4

Rearrange:

sqrt(m(m + 8)) > -4 + (m + 4)

Simplify RHS: m + 4 - 4 = m

So sqrt(m(m + 8)) > m

Square both sides (since both sides are positive):

m(m + 8) > m^2

Simplify:

m^2 + 8m > m^2

Subtract m^2:

8m > 0

Which is true since m > 0. Therefore, the first root is greater than -2.

Now check the second root:

[ - (m + 4) - sqrt(m(m + 8)) ] / 2 > -2

Multiply both sides by 2:

- (m + 4) - sqrt(m(m + 8)) > -4

Rearrange:

- sqrt(m(m + 8)) > -4 + (m + 4)

Simplify RHS: m + 4 - 4 = m

So:

- sqrt(m(m + 8)) > m

Multiply both sides by -1 (reversing inequality):

sqrt(m(m + 8)) < -m

But sqrt(m(m + 8)) is positive, and -m is negative (since m > 0). Therefore, a positive number is less than a negative number, which is impossible. Therefore, the second root is not greater than -2. Therefore, for k < 0, the quadratic equation has two roots, but only the first one (the larger root) is greater than -2. However, we need to check if that root is less than 0. Since k < 0, x must be in (-2, 0). So the first root is in (-2, 0), but is it positive or negative?

Wait, let's take an example. Let's pick k = -4 (as before). Then the quadratic equation becomes x^2 + 8x + 4 = 0. The roots are [-8 ± sqrt(64 - 16)] / 2 = [-8 ± sqrt(48)] / 2 = [-8 ± 4 * sqrt(3)] / 2 = -4 ± 2 * sqrt(3). So approximately, sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732, so 2 * sqrt(3) ≈ 3.464. Therefore, the roots are -4 + 3.464 ≈ -0.536 and -4 - 3.464 ≈ -7.464. So only the first root is in (-2, 0). The second root is less than -2, so invalid. Therefore, only one solution. So for k = -4, there's exactly one solution.

But wait, if k is another negative number, say k = -1. Then the quadratic equation is x^2 + (4 - (-1))x + 4 = x^2 + 5x + 4 = 0. The roots are x = [-5 ± sqrt(25 - 16)] / 2 = [-5 ± 3]/2, which are -1 and -4. So x = -1 and x = -4. But x must be in (-2, 0). So x = -1 is valid, x = -4 is not. So again, only one solution. Wait, but k = -1 is between -2 and 0? Wait, k = -1 is allowed (since k is integer from -500 to 500, excluding 0). Wait, but in this case, when k = -1, the quadratic equation has roots at -1 and -4. So x = -1 is in (-2, 0), so valid. x = -4 is invalid. Therefore, only one solution.

Wait, but according to our previous analysis, for any k < 0, the quadratic equation has two roots, one in (-2, 0) and one less than -2. Therefore, for all k < 0, the original equation would have exactly one solution. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let's check another example. Let's take k = -2.

Based on execution_4:
Therefore, for k < 0, all integers k from -1 to -1 (since k must be integer, and in the interval -500 to 500). Wait, but k can be any integer less than 0. But according to the above analysis, for all k < 0, the quadratic equation has exactly one root in the domain (-2, 0). Therefore, for all negative integers k, the equation has exactly one solution. But the problem states that k is in the closed interval [-500, 500], so k can be from -500 to 500 inclusive. However, k = 0 is invalid.

But according to our analysis, for all k < 0, the equation has exactly one solution. Therefore, the number of integer values of k in [-500, 500] for which the equation has exactly one solution is:

- For k > 8: none (since no integer k > 8 in the given interval)
- For k = 8: one value (k = 8)
- For k < 0: all integers from -1 to -500 inclusive.

Therefore, the total number is 500 (from -1 to -500) plus 1 (k = 8) = 501.

But wait, let's verify. The interval is [-500, 500]. The negative integers less than 0 are from -1 to -500 inclusive. So how many integers is that? From -1 to -500, that's 500 integers. Then k = 8 is one more. So total 501 integers.

<Execution>
Based on execution_4:
But wait, let's confirm. The problem states "the closed interval [-500,500]". So k can be any integer from -500 up to 500, inclusive. So the negative integers are -1, -2, ...., -500. That's 500 integers. Then k = 8. So total 501 integers. Therefore, the answer is 501.
</Execution>


Therefore, the number of integer values of $k$ in the closed interval $[-500,500]$ for which the equation $\log(kx)=2\log(x+2)$ has exactly one real solution is $\boxed{501}$.
