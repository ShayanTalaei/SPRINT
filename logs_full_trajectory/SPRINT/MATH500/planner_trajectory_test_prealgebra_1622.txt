Okay, let's see. The problem says that a regular hexagon can be divided into six equilateral triangles. Each of those triangles has a perimeter of 21 inches. We need to find the perimeter of the hexagon. Hmm, alright, let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to visualize a regular hexagon.

<prompt_1.1> Visualize a regular hexagon and recall its properties. </prompt_1.1>

Now, the problem mentions that the hexagon is divided into six equilateral triangles. I remember that in a regular hexagon, if you draw lines from the center to each vertex, you essentially split the hexagon into six equilateral triangles. Each of these triangles has two sides that are radii of the hexagon (the distance from the center to a vertex) and one side that's a side of the hexagon. Wait, but if all sides of the triangle are equal (since they're equilateral), that means the two radii and the side of the hexagon are all the same length.

<prompt_1.2> Analyze the properties of the equilateral triangles formed by dividing the hexagon and determine the side length of the hexagon. </prompt_1.2>

All sides are equal, and all internal angles are 120 degrees each. But how exactly is it divided into six equilateral triangles? Let me think. If I draw lines from the center to each of the six vertices, then each of those triangles would have two sides that are the radius of the circumscribed circle around the hexagon, and the third side would be one of the edges of the hexagon. Since the hexagon is regular, all those triangles should be congruent equilateral triangles. So each of those triangles has three sides: two radii and one side of the hexagon. But since they are equilateral, the two radii must be equal in length to the side of the hexagon. Therefore, the side length of each triangle is equal to the radius, which is also the side length of the hexagon.

So, the side length of the hexagon is equal to the radius of the triangles. That's key here.

But let's confirm that. In a regular hexagon, the distance from the center to any vertex is the same as the length of each side. Because all sides are equal and all central angles are equal (each 60 degrees since 360/6=60). So yes, each of those triangles is equilateral with all sides equal to the side length of the hexagon.

Based on execution_1.2:
The perimeter of one of these triangles is given as 21 inches. Since each triangle is equilateral, all three sides are equal.
Therefore, each side of the triangle is 21 divided by 3, which is 7 inches. So, each side of the triangle is 7 inches. But as we established earlier, each side of the triangle is equal to the side length of the hexagon. Therefore, the side length of the hexagon is 7 inches.

Now, to find the perimeter of the hexagon, we need to find the total length around it. A hexagon has six sides, so if each side is 7 inches, the perimeter would be 6 multiplied by 7.
Let me compute that: 6*7=42 inches. So, the perimeter of the hexagon should be 42 inches.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any wrong assumptions. Let's go through it again.

<prompt_2.1> Review the solution to verify the calculations and assumptions made. </prompt_2.1>

But let me think again. Maybe there's a different way to approach this. For example, if the hexagon is divided into six equilateral triangles, each with perimeter 21 inches, then each triangle has sides of length 7 inches. Since the hexagon's side is the same as the triangle's side, then each side of the hexagon is 7 inches. Therefore, six sides give 6*7=42 inches.

Another way to think about it: The regular hexagon can be divided into six equilateral triangles, each with side length 's'. The perimeter of each triangle is 3s. Given that 3s = 21, so s = 7. Then, the perimeter of the hexagon is 6s = 6*7=42.

Alternatively, maybe using the formula for the perimeter of a regular hexagon. The perimeter of a regular hexagon is 6 times the side length. If we can find the side length from the given information, which is the perimeter of one of the equilateral triangles. Since each triangle has three sides, each of length equal to the side of the hexagon, the side length of the hexagon is 21/3 = 7. Therefore, perimeter is 6*7=42.

1. The hexagon is divided into six equilateral triangles by drawing lines from the center to each vertex. Each triangle is equilateral, so all sides are equal.
2. The perimeter of each triangle is 21 inches. Since all sides are equal, each side is 21/3 = 7 inches.
3. Each side of the triangle corresponds to a side of the hexagon. Therefore, the side length of the hexagon is 7 inches.
4. The perimeter of the hexagon is 6 times the side length, so 6*7 = 42 inches.

</Execution_2>

<Final_answer>
Therefore, the perimeter of the regular hexagon is $\boxed{42}$ inches.
