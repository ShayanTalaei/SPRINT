Let $T$ be the set of all triples $(a,b,c)$ of positive integers for which there exist triangles with side lengths $a,$ $b,$ $c.$  Compute
\[\sum_{(a,b,c) \in T} \frac{2^a}{3^b 5^c}.\]
</Question>

<think>
<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to compute the sum over all triples (a, b, c) in the set T, where T consists of all triples of positive integers that can be the sides of a triangle. The sum is of the form 2^a / (3^b 5^c). Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that for three positive integers a, b, c to form a triangle, they must satisfy the triangle inequality. That is, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. So, for all three combinations: a + b > c, a + c > b, and b + c > a. Therefore, the set T is all ordered triples (a, b, c) where each of these inequalities holds.

But since the problem is symmetric in a, b, c, maybe I can exploit that symmetry somehow? Although the sum is not symmetric because the exponents are different: 2^a over 3^b 5^c. So, the variables a, b, c are weighted differently. Hmm.

So, perhaps I need to consider all possible triples (a, b, c) where a, b, c are positive integers satisfying the triangle inequalities, and sum 2^a / (3^b 5^c) over all such triples.

But how do I approach this? The problem seems to require summing over an infinite set, but maybe there's a way to express this sum as a product of three separate sums or something like that. But the triangle inequalities complicate things because they relate the three variables.

Alternatively, maybe I can parameterize the problem. Let's think: for fixed a and b, what are the possible c's such that the triangle inequalities hold?

Given a, b, c positive integers, the triangle inequalities are:

1. a + b > c
2. a + c > b
3. b + c > a

So, for fixed a and b, c must satisfy:

max(b - a + 1, a - b + 1, 1) < c < a + b

But since c must be a positive integer, let's see.

<prompt_1.1> Determine the range of c for fixed a and b that satisfies the triangle inequalities. </prompt_1.1>

But maybe there's a better way to handle this. Let me consider generating functions or some sort of product formula.

Alternatively, perhaps we can rewrite the sum as a product of three sums if we can decouple the variables. But the triangle inequalities couple them, so maybe not straightforward.

Wait, but maybe we can use the fact that the triangle inequalities can be rewritten in terms of each variable being less than the sum of the other two. So, perhaps we can express the sum as a triple sum with certain bounds.

Let me try to formalize this.

<prompt_1.2> Formalize the problem as a triple sum with certain bounds for a, b, c. </prompt_1.2>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
From the second inequality: a + c > b ⇒ c > b - a. Since c must be a positive integer, if b - a is positive, then c must be at least (b - a) + 1. Similarly, from the third inequality: b + c > a ⇒ c > a - b. Similarly, if a - b is positive, then c must be at least (a - b) + 1. However, if b - a is negative, then c > negative number, but since c is positive, the lower bound is just 1. So, combining these, the lower bound for c is max(1, b - a + 1, a - b + 1). But since max(b - a + 1, a - b + 1) is equal to |a - b| + 1. Therefore, the lower bound for c is |a - b| + 1, and the upper bound is a + b - 1 (since c must be less than a + b, but c is an integer, so the maximum c is a + b - 1).

Therefore, for given a and b, c ranges from |a - b| + 1 to a + b - 1.

<execution_1.2>
The sum S we need is:

S = Σ_{(a,b,c) ∈ T} [2^a / (3^b 5^c)]

Which can be written as:

S = Σ_{a=1}^∞ Σ_{b=1}^∞ Σ_{c=1}^∞ [2^a / (3^b 5^c)] * I(a, b, c)

Where I(a, b, c) is an indicator function that is 1 if (a, b, c) satisfies the triangle inequalities and 0 otherwise.

So, the problem reduces to computing this triple sum with the indicator function. However, directly computing this seems challenging. Maybe we can change the order of summation or find some way to express the constraints more manageable.
</execution_1.2>
</Execution_1>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Therefore, for each a and b, c ranges from |a - b| + 1 to a + b - 1. So, perhaps we can rewrite the triple sum as a double sum over a and b, with c summed from |a - b| + 1 to a + b - 1.

Therefore, S = Σ_{a=1}^∞ Σ_{b=1}^∞ [Σ_{c=|a - b| + 1}^{a + b - 1} 2^a / (3^b 5^c)]

Let me write that as:

S = Σ_{a=1}^∞ Σ_{b=1}^∞ [2^a / 3^b Σ_{c=|a - b| + 1}^{a + b - 1} (1/5)^c]

Okay, so the inner sum is a geometric series in c. Let's compute that.

<prompt_2.1> Compute the inner sum as a geometric series for fixed a and b. </prompt_2.1>
-----

But let me verify if this approach is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider fixing c first. But given the exponents are 2^a / (3^b 5^c), fixing c might not help as much.

Alternatively, maybe we can swap the order of summation. Let's see.

<prompt_2.2> Consider alternative approaches to verify the correctness of the current method. </prompt_2.2>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
The inner sum is Σ_{c=m}^{n} (1/5)^c where m = |a - b| + 1 and n = a + b - 1.

The sum of a geometric series from c = m to c = n is ( (1/5)^m - (1/5)^{n + 1} ) / (1 - 1/5) ) = ( (1/5)^m - (1/5)^{n + 1} ) / (4/5) ) = (5/4) [ (1/5)^m - (1/5)^{n + 1} ]

Therefore, substituting m and n:

Σ_{c=|a - b| + 1}^{a + b - 1} (1/5)^c = (5/4) [ (1/5)^{|a - b| + 1} - (1/5)^{(a + b - 1) + 1} ]

Simplify exponents:

= (5/4) [ (1/5)^{|a - b| + 1} - (1/5)^{a + b} ]

Therefore, substituting back into S:

S = Σ_{a=1}^∞ Σ_{b=1}^∞ [2^a / 3^b * (5/4) ( (1/5)^{|a - b| + 1} - (1/5)^{a + b} ) ]

Let me factor out the constants:

= (5/4) Σ_{a=1}^∞ Σ_{b=1}^∞ [2^a / 3^b * ( (1/5)^{|a - b| + 1} - (1/5)^{a + b} ) ]

Let me split this into two separate sums:

= (5/4) [ Σ_{a=1}^∞ Σ_{b=1}^∞ 2^a / 3^b (1/5)^{|a - b| + 1} - Σ_{a=1}^∞ Σ_{b=1}^∞ 2^a / 3^b (1/5)^{a + b} ]

Let me denote the first double sum as S1 and the second as S2. So:

S = (5/4)(S1 - S2)

First, compute S2, which seems simpler.

S2 = Σ_{a=1}^∞ Σ_{b=1}^∞ [2^a / 3^b * (1/5)^{a + b} ] = Σ_{a=1}^∞ Σ_{b=1}^∞ [2^a (1/5)^a ] [ (1/3)^b (1/5)^b ] = Σ_{a=1}^∞ (2/5)^a * Σ_{b=1}^∞ (1/(3*5))^b

Compute each geometric series:

Σ_{a=1}^∞ (2/5)^a = (2/5) / (1 - 2/5) ) = (2/5) / (3/5) ) = 2/3

Similarly, Σ_{b=1}^∞ (1/15)^b = (1/15) / (1 - 1/15) ) = (1/15) / (14/15) ) = 1/14

Therefore, S2 = (2/3) * (1/14) = 2/(42) = 1/21

Okay, so S2 = 1/21.

<execution_2.2>
Suppose we fix c first. Then, for each c, we need to sum over a and b such that a + b > c, |a - b| < c. But perhaps this is more complicated.

Alternatively, maybe we can use generating functions. Let's think of generating functions where each variable corresponds to a, b, c. But the triangle inequalities complicate things.

Alternatively, maybe consider that for a, b, c to form a triangle, they must satisfy a ≤ b + c, b ≤ a + c, c ≤ a + b. But since we are summing over all such triples, perhaps we can use some inclusion-exclusion principle? But that might be more complicated.

Alternatively, let's note that the sum S can be written as:

S = Σ_{a=1}^∞ 2^a Σ_{b=1}^∞ 1/3^b Σ_{c=|a - b| + 1}^{a + b - 1} (1/5)^c

So, first, for each a and b, compute the inner sum over c, then sum over b, then sum over a.

So, as I did before, let's compute the inner sum first. For fixed a and b, the inner sum is:

Σ_{c=|a - b| + 1}^{a + b - 1} (1/5)^c

This is a geometric series. The sum of (1/5)^c from c = m to c = n is:

( (1/5)^m - (1/5)^{n + 1} ) / (1 - 1/5) ) = ( (1/5)^m - (1/5)^{n + 1} ) / (4/5) ) = (5/4) [ (1/5)^m - (1/5)^{n + 1} ]

So, substituting m = |a - b| + 1 and n = a + b - 1, the inner sum becomes:

(5/4) [ (1/5)^{|a - b| + 1} - (1/5)^{a + b} ]

Therefore, substituting back into S:

S = Σ_{a=1}^∞ 2^a Σ_{b=1}^∞ [ (2/3) * (2/5)^{|a - b|} - (2/3) * (2/15)^{a + b - 1} ) ]

Wait, hold on. Let me check that substitution again.

Wait, the inner sum is (5/4) [ (1/5)^{|a - b| + 1} - (1/5)^{a + b} ]

So, multiplying by 2^a / 3^b, we have:

2^a / 3^b * (5/4) [ (1/5)^{|a - b| + 1} - (1/5)^{a + b} ]

Simplify this:

First term: 2^a / 3^b * (5/4) * (1/5)^{|a - b| + 1} = (5/4) * 2^a / 3^b * 5^{-|a - b| - 1} = (5/4) * (2^a / 3^b) * (1/5)^{|a - b| + 1}

Second term: Similarly, (5/4) * 2^a / 3^b * (1/5)^{a + b} = (5/4) * (2^a / 3^b) * (1/5)^{a + b}

Let's compute each term separately.
</execution_2.2>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.2:
First term:

(5/4) * Σ_{a=1}^∞ Σ_{b=1}^∞ (2^a / 3^b) * (1/5)^{|a - b| + 1}

Second term:

- (5/4) * Σ_{a=1}^∞ Σ_{b=1}^∞ (2^a / 3^b) * (1/5)^{a + b}

But the second term is exactly the same as S2 multiplied by (5/4):

<prompt_3.1> Compute the second term and subtract it from the first term. </prompt_3.1>
-----

Based on execution_2.1:
Therefore, S = (5/4)(S1 - 1/21)

So, now need to compute S1:

S1 = Σ_{a=1}^∞ Σ_{b=1}^∞ [2^a / 3^b * (1/5)^{|a - b| + 1} ]

Again, let's factor out the 1/5:

= (1/5) Σ_{a=1}^∞ Σ_{b=1}^∞ [2^a / 3^b * (1/5)^{|a - b|} ]

So, S1 = (1/5) * Σ_{a=1}^∞ Σ_{b=1}^∞ [2^a / 3^b * (1/5)^{|a - b|} ]
-----

Based on execution_2.1:
Now, let's compute S1. Let's write S1 as:

S1 = (1/5) Σ_{a=1}^∞ Σ_{b=1}^∞ [2^a / 3^b * (1/5)^{|a - b|} ]

Let me consider splitting this into two cases: when a ≥ b and when a < b. Because |a - b| is a - b when a ≥ b, and b - a when a < b.

Therefore, we can write S1 as:

(1/5) [ Σ_{a=1}^∞ Σ_{b=1}^a [2^a / 3^b (1/5)^{a - b} ] + Σ_{a=1}^∞ Σ_{b=a + 1}^∞ [2^a / 3^b (1/5)^{b - a} ] ]

Let me handle each part separately.

First, the sum over a ≥ b:

First part: Σ_{a=1}^∞ Σ_{b=1}^a [2^a / 3^b (1/5)^{a - b} ] = Σ_{a=1}^∞ 2^a / 5^a Σ_{b=1}^a (1/3)^b (5)^{b}

Wait, let's see:

<prompt_3.2> Compute the first part of S1. </prompt_3.2>

Now, the second part: Σ_{a=1}^∞ Σ_{b=a + 1}^∞ [2^a / 3^b (1/5)^{b - a} ]

Let me change variables. Let k = b - a. Then, for each a, k ≥ 1, and b = a + k. Therefore:

Second part: Σ_{a=1}^∞ Σ_{k=1}^∞ [2^a / 3^{a + k} (1/5)^k ] = Σ_{a=1}^∞ [2^a / 3^a Σ_{k=1}^∞ (1/(3*5))^k ]

Compute the inner sum:

<prompt_3.3> Compute the second part of S1. </prompt_3.3>
-----

Based on execution_2.1:
Therefore, S1 = (1/5)(S1a + S1b) = (1/5)( (1/2) + (1/3) ) = (1/5)(5/6) = 1/6

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again.

<prompt_3.4> Conclude the computation of S and verify the result. </prompt_3.4>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
The second term in S is - (5/4) * S2, since S2 was computed as Σ_{a,b} [2^a / 3^b (1/5)^{a + b} ] = 2/(3*14) = 1/21. Wait, no. Wait, S2 was computed as (2/3)*(1/14) = 1/21. Therefore, the second term is - (5/4)*(1/21) = -5/84.

Wait, hold on. Wait, no. Wait, S1 is the first double sum, which is Σ_{a,b} [2^a / 3^b (1/5)^{|a - b| + 1} ]. So, S1 = (1/5) Σ_{a,b} [2^a / 3^b (1/5)^{|a - b|} ]. Then, S = (5/4)(S1 - S2). Then S2 is 1/21, so S1 - S2 is (1/5)(... ) - 1/21. Wait, no. Wait, S1 is already (1/5) times the double sum, so S1 - S2 would be (1/5) * ΣΣ [ ... ] - 1/21. But perhaps I need to re-express this.

Wait, perhaps I need to compute S1 as:

S1 = (1/5) [ (1/2) + (1/3) ] = (1/5)(5/6) = 1/6

Then, S = (5/4)(S1 - S2) = (5/4)(1/6 - 1/21)

Compute 1/6 - 1/21: common denominator is 42. 7/42 - 2/42 = 5/42. Therefore, S = (5/4)(5/42) = 25/168 ≈ 0.1488...

Wait, but let me check if S1 is indeed 1/6.

Wait, S1a = Σ_{a=1}^∞ [2^a / 3^a * 1/2 ] = Σ_{a=1}^∞ (2/3)^a * 1/2. Let's compute that:

Σ_{a=1}^∞ (2/3)^a = (2/3)/(1 - 2/3) ) = (2/3)/(1/3) ) = 2. Then, multiplied by 1/2 gives 1. So, S1a = 1. Similarly, S1b = Σ_{a=1}^∞ [2^a / 3^a * 1/3 ] = Σ_{a=1}^∞ (2/3)^a * 1/3. Then, Σ_{a=1}^∞ (2/3)^a = 2, so multiplied by 1/3 gives 2/3. Therefore, S1b = 2/3. Therefore, S1a + S1b = 1 + 2/3 = 5/3. Then, S1 = (1/5)*(5/3) = 1/3.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
= Σ_{a=1}^∞ (2/5)^a Σ_{b=1}^a ( (1/3) * 5 )^b

Wait, (1/3)^b * 5^b = (5/3)^b. So:

= Σ_{a=1}^∞ (2/5)^a Σ_{b=1}^a (5/3)^b

The inner sum is a finite geometric series:

Σ_{b=1}^a (5/3)^b = (5/3) [ ( (5/3)^a - 1 ) / (5/3 - 1) ) ] = (5/3) [ ( (5/3)^a - 1 ) / (2/3) ) ] = (5/3) * (3/2) [ (5/3)^a - 1 ] = (5/2) [ (5/3)^a - 1 ]

Therefore, the first part becomes:

Σ_{a=1}^∞ (2/5)^a * (5/2) [ (5/3)^a - 1 ] = (5/2) Σ_{a=1}^∞ [ (2/5 * 5/3)^a - (2/5)^a ]

Simplify the terms inside the sum:

(2/5 * 5/3)^a = (2/3)^a

So:

= (5/2) Σ_{a=1}^∞ [ (2/3)^a - (2/5)^a ] = (5/2) [ Σ_{a=1}^∞ (2/3)^a - Σ_{a=1}^∞ (2/5)^a ]

Compute each geometric series:

Σ_{a=1}^∞ (2/3)^a = (2/3) / (1 - 2/3) ) = (2/3) / (1/3) ) = 2

Σ_{a=1}^∞ (2/5)^a = (2/5) / (1 - 2/5) ) = (2/5) / (3/5) ) = 2/3

Therefore, the first part is:

(5/2)(2 - 2/3) = (5/2)(4/3) = 10/3 ≈ 3.333...
</execution_3.2>

<execution_3.3>
(1/3)^k starting from k=1:

Σ_{k=1}^∞ (1/(15))^k = (1/15) / (1 - 1/15) ) = (1/15) / (14/15) ) = 1/14

Therefore, the second part becomes:

Σ_{a=1}^∞ [ (2/3)^a * (1/14) ] = (1/14) Σ_{a=1}^∞ (2/3)^a = (1/14) * (2/3) / (1 - 2/3) ) = (1/14) * (2/3) / (1/3) ) = (1/14) * 2 = 1/7
</execution_3.3>

<execution_3.4>
Wait, S1a was 1/2 and S1b was 1/3, so S1 = (1/5)(1/2 + 1/3) = (1/5)(5/6) = 1/6. Hmm, okay. So S1 = 1/6.

Therefore, going back to S:

S = (5/4)(S1 - S2) = (5/4)(1/6 - 1/21)

Compute 1/6 - 1/21: Find a common denominator, which is 42.

1/6 = 7/42, 1/21 = 2/42. So, 7/42 - 2/42 = 5/42.

Therefore, S = (5/4)(5/42) = 25/168 ≈ 0.1488...

Based on execution_3.4:
Wait, but let me check this. Let me verify all steps once more because it's easy to make a mistake in the algebra.

First, S1a was Σ_{a=1}^∞ [2^a / 3^a * 1/2 ].

<execution_4.1>
Let's see, 2^a / 3^a is (2/3)^a. Then multiplying by 1/2: So, Σ_{a=1}^∞ (2/3)^a * 1/2. The sum Σ_{a=1}^∞ (2/3)^a is (2/3)/(1 - 2/3) ) = 2. Then multiplied by 1/2 gives 1.
</execution_4.1>

<execution_4.2>
Let's check:

For S1a: 2^a / 3^a * 1/2 = (2/3)^a * 1/2. The sum Σ_{a=1}^∞ (2/3)^a is (2/3)/(1 - 2/3) = 2. Then multiplied by 1/2 gives 1. So, S1a = 1. Then, S1b: 2^a / 3^a * 1/3 = (2/3)^a * 1/3. The sum Σ_{a=1}^∞ (2/3)^a * 1/3 is (1/3) * [ (2/3) / (1 - 2/3) ) ] = (1/3) * 2 = 2/3. Therefore, S1a + S1b = 1 + 2/3 = 5/3. Then, S1 = (1/5)(5/3) = 1/3. Wait, this contradicts my previous statement where I said S1 = 1/6. So, which is correct?

Wait, no. Wait, in the first part, S1a was Σ_{a=1}^∞ [2^a / 3^a * 1/2 ] which is 1. Then S1b was Σ_{a=1}^∞ [2^a / 3^a * 1/3 ] which is 2/3. So, total S1a + S1b = 1 + 2/3 = 5/3. Then, S1 = (1/5)(5/3) = 1/3. Therefore, S1 = 1/3. Then, S2 = 1/21. Therefore, S = (5/4)(1/3 - 1/21) = (5/4)(7/21 - 1/21) = (5/4)(6/21) = (5/4)(2/7) = 10/28 = 5/14 ≈ 0.3571.

But this contradicts the previous result. So, there must be an error here. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps in the calculation of S1a and S1b.

Wait, S1a is:

Σ_{a=1}^∞ [2^a / 3^a * 1/2 ] = (1/2) Σ_{a=1}^∞ (2/3)^a = (1/2) * [ (2/3) / (1 - 2/3) ) ] = (1/2) * [ (2/3) / (1/3) ) ] = (1/2) * 2 = 1. That's correct.

S1b is:

Σ_{a=1}^∞ [2^a / 3^a * 1/3 ] = (1/3) Σ_{a=1}^∞ (2/3)^a = (1/3) * [ (2/3) / (1 - 2/3) ) ] = (1/3) * [ (2/3) / (1/3) ) ] = (1/3) * 2 = 2/3. Correct.

Therefore, S1a + S1b = 1 + 2/3 = 5/3. Then, S1 = (1/5)(5/3) = 1/3. Therefore, S1 = 1/3. Then S2 = 1/21. Then S = (5/4)(1/3 - 1/21) = (5/4)(7/21 - 1/21) = (5/4)(6/21) = (5/4)(2/7) = 10/28 = 5/14 ≈ 0.3571.

But this contradicts the previous result where I thought S1 was 1/6. So, which is correct? Let me check again.

Wait, in the previous approach, when I computed S1a and S1b, I think I miscalculated. Let me retrace:



But let's verify this with another approach. Let's compute S1 directly.



Therefore, S1 = 1/3. Then S2 = 1/21.

Therefore, S = (5/4)(1/3 - 1/21) = (5/4)( (7 - 1)/21 ) = (5/4)(6/21) = (5/4)(2/7) = 10/28 = 5/14 ≈ 0.3571.

But let me check with another approach. Let's compute S1 directly.
</execution_4.2>

<execution_4.3>
Let me recompute S1.

First, S1 is Σ_{a=1}^∞ Σ_{b=1}^∞ [2^a / 3^b (1/5)^{|a - b|} ].

Breaking into two cases: a ≥ b and a < b.

Case 1: a ≥ b. Let’s fix b and let a run from b to ∞. Then, |a - b| = a - b. So, for each b, the sum over a is:

Σ_{a=b}^∞ 2^a / 3^b (1/5)^{a - b} = (1/3^b) Σ_{a=b}^∞ (2^a / 5^{a - b}) ) = (1/3^b) Σ_{a=b}^∞ (2^a / 5^{a} * 5^b ) ) = (1/3^b)(5^b) Σ_{a=b}^∞ (2/5)^a = (5^b / 3^b) Σ_{a=b}^∞ (2/5)^a

Let’s change variable: let k = a - b, so when a = b, k=0. Then:

Σ_{a=b}^∞ (2/5)^a = Σ_{k=0}^∞ (2/5)^{b + k} = (2/5)^b Σ_{k=0}^∞ (2/5)^k = (2/5)^b * (1 / (1 - 2/5)) ) = (2/5)^b * (5/3) = (5/3)(2/5)^b

Therefore, the sum over a ≥ b is:

(5^b / 3^b) * (5/3)(2/5)^b = (5/3) * (5^b / 3^b) * (2^b / 5^b) ) = (5/3) * (2/3)^b

Therefore, the entire first part is Σ_{b=1}^∞ (5/3)(2/3)^b = (5/3) Σ_{b=1}^∞ (2/3)^b = (5/3) * ( (2/3) / (1 - 2/3) ) ) = (5/3) * (2/3 / 1/3) ) = (5/3)*2 = 10/3. Wait, but that contradicts previous result.

Wait, no. Wait, let's re-examine.

Wait, when a ≥ b, for each b, the sum over a is:

Σ_{a=b}^∞ [2^a / 3^b (1/5)^{a - b} ] = Σ_{a=b}^∞ [ (2/5)^{a - b} * (2^b / 3^b) ] = (2^b / 3^b) Σ_{k=0}^∞ (2/5)^k = (2^b / 3^b) * (1 / (1 - 2/5)) ) = (2^b / 3^b) * (5/3) = (5/3)(2/3)^b

Therefore, summing over b from 1 to ∞:

Σ_{b=1}^∞ (5/3)(2/3)^b = (5/3) * [ (2/3) / (1 - 2/3) ) - 1 ] Wait, no. Wait, Σ_{b=1}^∞ r^b = r / (1 - r). So, Σ_{b=1}^∞ (2/3)^b = (2/3) / (1 - 2/3) ) = (2/3) / (1/3) ) = 2. Therefore, the first part is (5/3)*2 = 10/3.

Similarly, for the case a < b. Let’s fix a and let b run from a + 1 to ∞. Then, |a - b| = b - a. So, for each a, the sum over b is:

Σ_{b=a+1}^∞ [2^a / 3^b (1/5)^{b - a} ] = 2^a Σ_{b=a+1}^∞ (1/3)^b (5)^{b - a} = 2^a 5^{-a} Σ_{b=a+1}^∞ (1/3)^b 5^b = 2^a 5^{-a} Σ_{b=a+1}^∞ (5/3)^b

But (5/3)^b is greater than 1, so the series diverges. Wait, that can't be. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra.

Wait, let's re-express:

<execution_4.4>
Original S2 computation:

S2 = Σ_{a=1}^∞ Σ_{b=1}^∞ [2^a / 3^b (1/5)^{a + b} ] = Σ_{a=1}^∞ [2^a / 5^a ] * Σ_{b=1}^∞ [ (1/3)^b 5^b ]

Wait, wait, 1/5^{a + b} = (1/5)^a * (1/5)^b. Then, 2^a / 3^b = (2/5)^a * (1/3)^b. Therefore:

S2 = Σ_{a=1}^∞ (2/5)^a Σ_{b=1}^∞ (1/3 * 5)^b = Σ_{a=1}^∞ (2/5)^a Σ_{b=1}^∞ (5/3)^b

But Σ_{b=1}^∞ (5/3)^b is a divergent series, but that can't be. Wait, this suggests a mistake in the previous computation.

Wait, hold on. Wait, 1/5^{a + b} is (1/5)^a * (1/5)^b. Then, 2^a / 3^b = (2/5)^a * (1/3)^b. Therefore:

S2 = Σ_{a=1}^∞ (2/5)^a Σ_{b=1}^∞ (1/3)^b (1/5)^b = Σ_{a=1}^∞ (2/5)^a Σ_{b=1}^∞ (1/(3*5))^b = Σ_{a=1}^∞ (2/5)^a * Σ_{b=1}^∞ (1/15)^b

Ah, yes! Because (1/3)^b * (1/5)^b = (1/(3*5))^b = (1/15)^b. Therefore, the inner sum is Σ_{b=1}^∞ (1/15)^b, which is a convergent geometric series.

Therefore, Σ_{b=1}^∞ (1/15)^b = (1/15) / (1 - 1/15) ) = (1/15) / (14/15) ) = 1/14.

Then, Σ_{a=1}^∞ (2/5)^a = (2/5) / (1 - 2/5) ) = (2/5) / (3/5) ) = 2/3.

Therefore, S2 = (2/3) * (1/14) = 2/42 = 1/21 ≈ 0.0476.
</execution_4.4>

<execution_4.5>
Wait, S2 was computed as 1/21. Then S = (5/4)(1/6 - 1/21). Let me compute 1/6 - 1/21:

1/6 = 7/42, 1/21 = 2/42. So, 7/42 - 2/42 = 5/42. Then, 5/4 * 5/42 = 25/168 ≈ 0.1488.
</execution_4.5>

<execution_4.6>
Wait, let's confirm:

First part: a ≥ b. For each a, sum over b=1 to a. Then, for each such b, we have (1/5)^{|a - b|} = (1/5)^{a - b} since a ≥ b.

So, for a fixed a, the inner sum over b is:

Σ_{b=1}^a [2^a / 3^b (1/5)^{a - b} ] = 2^a / 5^a Σ_{b=1}^a (1/3)^b 5^{b} = 2^a / 5^a Σ_{b=1}^a (5/3)^b

Wait, hold on, 3^b * 5^{a - b} = 3^b * 5^{a} / 5^b = 5^a / (5/3)^b. Wait, perhaps this approach is better:

Wait, 3^b * 5^{a - b} = 5^a / (5/3)^b. Hmm, perhaps not. Let me re-examine:

Wait, 3^b * 5^{a - b} = 5^a * (3/5)^b. Because 3^b / 5^b = (3/5)^b, so 5^{a - b} = 5^a / 5^b. Therefore, 3^b * 5^{a - b} = 5^a * (3/5)^b. Therefore, 1/(3^b * 5^{a - b}) = (5/3)^b / 5^a.

Therefore, the term inside the sum is 2^a / (3^b * 5^{a - b}) = (2^a / 5^a) * (5/3)^b.

Therefore, the inner sum becomes:

Σ_{b=1}^a (2/5)^a * (5/3)^b = (2/5)^a Σ_{b=1}^a (5/3)^b

Which is the same as:

(2/5)^a * [ (5/3) * ( ( (5/3)^a - 1 ) / (5/3 - 1) ) ] as before.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled, but the previous computation led to S1 = 1/3.
</execution_4.6>

<execution_4.7>
Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of S1. Let's re-examine S1.

Wait, S1 was S1 = (1/5)(S1a + S1b). S1a was Σ_{a=1}^∞ [2^a / 3^a * 1/2 ].

Compute S1a: Σ_{a=1}^∞ (2/3)^a * 1/2.

Σ_{a=1}^∞ (2/3)^a = (2/3)/(1 - 2/3) = 2. Then multiplied by 1/2 gives 1. So S1a = 1.

Similarly, S1b: Σ_{a=1}^∞ [2^a / 3^a * 1/3 ] = Σ_{a=1}^∞ (2/3)^a * 1/3.

Σ_{a=1}^∞ (2/3)^a = 2, so 2 * 1/3 = 2/3. Therefore, S1b = 2/3.

Therefore, S1a + S1b = 1 + 2/3 = 5/3. Then, S1 = (1/5)(5/3) = 1/3. Wait, this contradicts my previous calculation. Wait, no, earlier I thought S1a was 1 and S1b was 2/3, so 1 + 2/3 = 5/3, then S1 = (1/5)(5/3) = 1/3. But in the previous write-up, I had written S1a = 1/2 and S1b = 1/3. That was a mistake.

Wait, let's go back.

In the S1a calculation:
