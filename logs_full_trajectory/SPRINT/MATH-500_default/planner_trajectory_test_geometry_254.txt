Okay, so I need to find the length of the third side of a triangle where two of the sides are 1 unit and 3 units. And the third side has to be an integer. Hmm, let me think. I remember there's something called the triangle inequality theorem. Let me recall what that says. I think it states that the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side. So, if the sides are a, b, and c, then a + b > c, a + c > b, and b + c > a. Right?
So, in this case, we have two sides: 1 and 3. Let's call the third side x, which is an integer. So, applying the triangle inequality, we need to make sure that all three inequalities hold.

First, let's write them down.

<prompt_1.1> Write down the three inequalities for the triangle with sides 1, 3, and an integer x. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
1. 1 + 3 > x
2. 1 + x > 3
3. 3 + x > 1

Let me simplify each of these inequalities.

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Starting with the first one: 1 + 3 > x. That simplifies to 4 > x, or x < 4.

Second inequality: 1 + x > 3. Subtracting 1 from both sides gives x > 2.

Third inequality: 3 + x > 1. Subtracting 3 from both sides gives x > -2. But since a length can't be negative, this inequality doesn't really add any new information. So, the relevant inequalities are x < 4 and x > 2.

<prompt_2.1> Determine the range of possible values for x using the inequalities x < 4 and x > 2. </prompt_2.1>

Wait, but let me double-check. If the sides are 1, 3, and 3, does that form a valid triangle?

<prompt_2.2> Verify if the third side length of 3 forms a valid triangle with sides 1 and 3. </prompt_2.2>
-----

Alternatively, if x were 2, then sides would be 1, 2, 3. But 1 + 2 = 3, which again is not greater than 3. So, 2 is invalid.
Similarly, if x is 1, even worse. So, yes, 3 is the only integer that works.

Wait, but let me check if there's any other integer that could satisfy. Let's list possible integers.

<prompt_2.3> List possible integer values for x and verify which ones satisfy the triangle inequalities. </prompt_2.3>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Since x must be an integer, what integer values satisfy 2 < x < 4? The integers between 2 and 4 are 3. So, x must be 3.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Let's check the triangle inequalities again. 1 + 3 > 3? That's 4 > 3, which is true. 1 + 3 > 3? Same as above. And 3 + 3 > 1, which is 6 > 1, true. So, yes, 3 works.
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
x has to be greater than 2 and less than 4. So possible integers are 3. Because 2 < x < 4, so x can be 3. Since x must be an integer, 3 is the only possibility. Let me confirm again. If x is 3, then the sides are 1, 3, 3. That works because 1 + 3 > 3 (4 > 3), 3 + 3 > 1 (6 > 1), and 1 + 3 > 3 (same as the first one). So all inequalities are satisfied.
</execution_2.3>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
But hold on, let me make sure I didn't miss anything here.

Wait, the third inequality was x > -2, but since x has to be positive, that's automatically satisfied. So, the only constraints are x > 2 and x < 4. Therefore, x can be 3.
Since x must be an integer, 3 is the only possible value.
-----

Therefore, the third side must be 3 units long.

Is there any other integer between 2 and 4?

<prompt_3.1> Check if there are any other integer values between 2 and 4 that satisfy the triangle inequalities. </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
No, because 2 and 4 are consecutive integers, so only 3 is in between. So, 3 is the only possible integer value for the third side.

Wait a second, but let me visualize this triangle. If two sides are 1 and 3, the third side being 3 would make it an isosceles triangle with sides 1, 3, 3. That should be a valid triangle. The two equal sides are 3 each, and the base is 1. The angles opposite the equal sides would be equal, and the base angles would be smaller than the apex angle. But since all sides are positive and the sum of the two smaller sides (1 and 3) is greater than the third side (3), it's valid.
</execution_3.1>
</Execution_3>

<Final_answer>
Therefore, the length of the third side, which must be an integer, is $\boxed{3}$ units.
