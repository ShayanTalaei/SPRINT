Okay, so I need to find the maximum angle APB between points A and B as they run along the track. Let me try to visualize the problem first.
There's a track which is a straight line, and both runners start at point O on this track. They run in the same direction, and runner B is three times as fast as runner A. There's an observer at point P, which is perpendicular to the track from point O. So, if I imagine the track as the x-axis, point O is at (0,0), and point P is at (0, p) where p is some distance above the track.

The Asymptote code shows a diagram where A is at (0.4,0), B is at (1.2,0), O is at (0,0), and P is at (0,1). So, in the diagram, P is one unit above O, and A and B are at 0.4 and 1.2 units along the track respectively. But in reality, the positions of A and B will depend on time since they are running.

Since they start at O and run in the same direction, their positions at time t will be along the x-axis. Let's denote the speed of runner A as v. Then, runner B's speed is 3v. So, the position of A at time t is (vt, 0), and the position of B is (3vt, 0). The observer is at point P(0, p).

We need to find the maximum value of the angle APB. Angle APB is the angle at point P between points A and B. So, in terms of coordinates, we can think of this angle as the angle between the lines PA and PB.

To find the maximum angle APB, we can use some trigonometry. Let's consider triangle APB. The angle at P is what we need to maximize. To find this angle, we can use the tangent function or the law of cosines. But since we have coordinates, maybe using coordinates would be better.

Let me set up a coordinate system.
Let’s assume the track is the x-axis, O is at (0,0), and P is at (0, h) where h is the height. The positions of A and B at time t are (vt, 0) and (3vt, 0) respectively.

The angle APB can be found using the coordinates of A, P, and B. Let's denote the coordinates as follows:

<prompt_1.1> Set up a coordinate system and express the coordinates of points A, B, and P. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
- A: (vt, 0)
- B: (3vt, 0)
- P: (0, h)

We need to find the angle APB. To find this angle, we can compute the angle between the vectors PA and PB.

First, let's find the vectors PA and PB.

Vector PA goes from P to A: (vt - 0, 0 - h) = (vt, -h)

Vector PB goes from P to B: (3vt - 0, 0 - h) = (3vt, -h)

The angle between two vectors can be found using the dot product formula:

cos(theta) = (PA · PB) / (|PA| |PB|)

Compute the dot product PA · PB:

(vt)(3vt) + (-h)(-h) = 3v²t² + h²

Compute |PA|:

sqrt( (vt)^2 + (-h)^2 ) = sqrt(v²t² + h²)

Similarly, |PB|:

sqrt( (3vt)^2 + (-h)^2 ) = sqrt(9v²t² + h²)

Therefore,

cos(theta) = (3v²t² + h²) / ( sqrt(v²t² + h²) * sqrt(9v²t² + h²) )

Our goal is to maximize theta, which is equivalent to minimizing cos(theta), since cos(theta) is a decreasing function in [0, π].

</Execution_1>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
So, we need to find the value of t that minimizes the expression:

(3v²t² + h²) / ( sqrt(v²t² + h²) * sqrt(9v²t² + h²) )

Let me simplify this expression. Let’s denote x = vt, so that x is a variable representing the distance of runner A from O at time t. Then, since runner B is 3 times as fast, his distance from O is 3x. So, substituting x into the equation:

<prompt_2.1> Simplify the expression by substituting x = vt. </prompt_2.1>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
cos(theta) = (3x² + h²) / ( sqrt(x² + h²) * sqrt(9x² + h²) )

Now, we need to find x > 0 that minimizes this expression. Once we find the x that minimizes cos(theta), that will give us the maximum theta, which is angle APB.

</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Alternatively, since h is a constant (the height of point P), we can consider h as a constant and find the derivative with respect to x, set it to zero, and solve for x. That will give the critical point which could be a minimum.

Let’s denote f(x) = (3x² + h²) / ( sqrt(x² + h²) * sqrt(9x² + h²) )

We need to find the x that minimizes f(x).

To find the minimum, take the derivative f’(x), set it equal to zero, and solve for x.

But before taking derivatives, maybe we can simplify f(x):

<prompt_3.1> Simplify the function f(x) and consider taking its derivative. </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
Let’s write f(x) as:

f(x) = (3x² + h²) / [ sqrt{(x² + h²)(9x² + h²)} ]

Let’s compute the denominator:

sqrt{(x² + h²)(9x² + h²)} = sqrt{9x^4 + 10x²h² + h^4}

So, f(x) = (3x² + h²) / sqrt(9x^4 + 10x²h² + h^4)

Hmm, perhaps we can square f(x) to make it easier, since the square will also be minimized at the same point. Let’s consider f(x)^2:

[ (3x² + h²)^2 ] / [9x^4 + 10x²h² + h^4]

Let’s compute the numerator:

(3x² + h²)^2 = 9x^4 + 6x²h² + h^4

Therefore, f(x)^2 = (9x^4 + 6x²h² + h^4) / (9x^4 + 10x²h² + h^4)

So, f(x)^2 = [9x^4 + 6x²h² + h^4] / [9x^4 + 10x²h² + h^4]

To minimize f(x), we can equivalently minimize f(x)^2. Let’s denote N = numerator and D = denominator:

N = 9x^4 + 6x²h² + h^4

D = 9x^4 + 10x²h² + h^4

Therefore, f(x)^2 = N / D = 1 - (4x²h²)/D

So, to minimize f(x)^2, we need to minimize 1 - (4x²h²)/D, which is equivalent to maximizing (4x²h²)/D.

Thus, maximizing (4x²h²)/D is equivalent to maximizing x² / D, since h² is a constant.

So, we need to maximize x² / (9x^4 + 10x²h² + h^4)

Let’s denote y = x². Then, the expression becomes:

y / (9y² + 10y h² + h^4)

So, we need to maximize this expression with respect to y > 0.

Let’s denote g(y) = y / (9y² + 10y h² + h^4)

To find the maximum of g(y), take derivative g’(y), set to zero.

Compute g’(y):

Using quotient rule:

g’(y) = [ (1)(9y² + 10y h² + h^4) - y(18y + 10h²) ] / (9y² + 10y h² + h^4)^2

Set numerator equal to zero:

(9y² + 10y h² + h^4) - y(18y + 10h²) = 0

Expand the second term:

9y² + 10y h² + h^4 - 18y² - 10y h² = 0

Simplify:

(9y² - 18y²) + (10y h² - 10y h²) + h^4 = 0

-9y² + h^4 = 0

Thus:

-9y² + h^4 = 0 => 9y² = h^4 => y² = h^4 / 9 => y = h² / 3

Since y = x², so x² = h² / 3 => x = h / sqrt(3)

Therefore, the maximum of g(y) occurs at y = h² / 3, so x = h / sqrt(3)

</Execution_3>

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
Let’s verify this is a maximum.

Take the second derivative or test points around y = h² / 3.

<prompt_4.1> Verify that the critical point y = h² / 3 is a maximum. </prompt_4.1>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
Let’s pick y slightly less than h² / 3, say y = h² / 3 - ε. Then, compute the numerator of g’(y):

9y² + 10y h² + h^4 - 18y² - 10y h² = -9y² + h^4

If y = h² / 3 - ε, then y² ≈ h^4 / 9 - (2h² / 3)ε

So, -9y² + h^4 ≈ -9(h^4 / 9 - (2h² / 3)ε) + h^4 = -h^4 + 6h² ε + h^4 = 6h² ε > 0

Similarly, if y is slightly more than h² / 3, then -9y² + h^4 ≈ -9(h^4 / 9 + (2h² / 3)ε) + h^4 = -h^4 -6h² ε + h^4 = -6h² ε < 0

Therefore, the derivative changes from positive to negative as y increases through h² / 3, so the function g(y) has a maximum at y = h² / 3.

<Plan_5>
Based on execution_4.1:
Therefore, the maximum of angle APB occurs when x = h / sqrt(3).

Now, let's compute the maximum angle.

First, recall that f(x) was cos(theta), so the minimal value of f(x) is when x = h / sqrt(3). Let's compute f(h / sqrt(3)):

<prompt_5.1> Calculate the minimum value of f(x) and the corresponding angle. </prompt_5.1>
</Plan_5>

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
Compute numerator: 3x² + h² = 3*(h² / 3) + h² = h² + h² = 2h²

Compute denominator: sqrt(x² + h²) * sqrt(9x² + h²)

First, x² = h² / 3, so:

sqrt( h² / 3 + h² ) = sqrt( (1/3 + 1)h² ) = sqrt(4/3 h²) = (2h)/sqrt(3)

Similarly, sqrt(9*(h² / 3) + h²) = sqrt(3h² + h²) = sqrt(4h²) = 2h

Therefore, denominator is (2h / sqrt(3)) * 2h = (4h²) / sqrt(3)

Thus, f(x) = (2h²) / (4h² / sqrt(3)) ) = (2h² * sqrt(3)) / (4h²) ) = sqrt(3)/2

Therefore, cos(theta) = sqrt(3)/2, which implies theta = 30 degrees.

But wait, this is the minimal value of cos(theta), which corresponds to the maximum angle theta. So, the maximum angle is 30 degrees.

<execution_6.1>
When A and B are at the starting point O, the angle APB would be the angle between two lines from P to O and to B. But as A and B move away, the angle APB changes. The maximum angle occurs when the rate of change of the angle with respect to time is zero. According to our calculation, this maximum angle is 30 degrees.

But let's consider when A and B are at certain positions. For example, when A is very close to O, the angle APB would be small because both A and B are near O, so the lines PA and PB are almost in the same direction. As A and B move away, the angle APB increases. However, after a certain point, as they continue moving away, the angle might start decreasing again because the direction of PB becomes more horizontal, reducing the angle. Therefore, there should be a maximum at some point in between. Our calculation suggests that the maximum angle is 30 degrees. Let's see if that's reasonable.

Alternatively, let's consider the case when the angle is 90 degrees. For that to happen, the vectors PA and PB would need to be perpendicular, so their dot product would be zero. Let's check if that's possible.

If vectors PA · PB = 0, then 3v²t² + h² = 0, which is impossible since h and v are positive. Therefore, the angle can never be 90 degrees, so 30 degrees seems more reasonable.
</execution_6.1>

<execution_6.2>
First, when we set up the coordinate system, P is at (0, h). Then, as the runners move along the x-axis, the angle at P between A and B is determined by their positions. We derived the expression for cos(theta) in terms of x (which is vt). Then, through substitution and calculus, we found that the minimal cos(theta) occurs at x = h / sqrt(3), leading to cos(theta) = sqrt(3)/2, which gives theta = 30 degrees.

But let me verify if the angle can indeed be 30 degrees. If the runners are very far away, the angle would approach zero. If they are at the starting point O, the angle would be 180 degrees, but since they start at O, but as soon as they move, the angle starts decreasing. Wait, but when they are very close to O, the angle is large. Wait, maybe my intuition is conflicting here.

Wait, when the runners are at O (x=0), then points A and B are both at O, so the angle APB would be undefined or 180 degrees? But in reality, when x approaches zero, the angle APB approaches the angle between two points approaching O, so the lines PA and PB would be almost overlapping, so the angle would approach 0 degrees? Wait, no. If A and B are both at O, then angle APB would be the angle between two lines from P to the same point, which is zero. But as they start moving away, A and B separate, so the angle increases. So, the angle starts at 0 degrees when they are at O, and as they move away, the angle increases to a maximum and then decreases again as they continue moving away. Wait, but in our calculation, we found that the maximum angle is 30 degrees. But according to the problem, the observer is at P, and the runners start at O. So, as the runners move away, the angle APB first increases to a maximum and then decreases. However, in our analysis, we found only one critical point, which is a maximum. Therefore, that must be the maximum angle.

But let's check the value. If h is the height of point P above the track, and when x = h / sqrt(3), then the angle is 30 degrees. Let's see if this makes sense.

Suppose h is 1, as in the Asymptote code. Then, x = 1 / sqrt(3). So, the runners are at x = 1/sqrt(3) and 3/sqrt(3) = sqrt(3). So, A is at (1/sqrt(3), 0), B is at (sqrt(3), 0), and P is at (0,1). Then, the angle at P between these two points. Let's compute the angle.

Compute vectors PA and PB:

PA = (1/sqrt(3), -1)

PB = (sqrt(3), -1)

Compute the angle between them. The dot product is (1/sqrt(3))(sqrt(3)) + (-1)(-1) = 1 + 1 = 2.

The magnitudes:

|PA| = sqrt( (1/3) + 1 ) = sqrt(4/3) = 2/sqrt(3)

|PB| = sqrt( 3 + 1 ) = sqrt(4) = 2

Therefore, cos(theta) = 2 / ( (2/sqrt(3)) * 2 ) = 2 / (4 / sqrt(3)) ) = (2 * sqrt(3)) / 4 = sqrt(3)/2, so theta = 30 degrees. Correct.

But let's check when x is very small. Suppose x approaches 0. Then, A and B are both near O. Then, angle APB is approaching the angle between two lines from P(0,1) to (0,0) and (0,0). But since both points are approaching the same point, the angle between them should approach 0 degrees. Wait, but in our previous calculation, when x approaches 0, the cos(theta) would approach (0 + h²) / (sqrt(0 + h²) * sqrt(0 + h²)) ) = h² / (h * h) = 1, so theta approaches 0 degrees. That's correct. When x is very large, say x approaches infinity, then the positions of A and B are far away. Then, angle APB would approach the angle between two points at infinity, which would be determined by the ratio of their distances. But since B is three times as far as A, the angle would approach the angle between two lines with horizontal separations 2x and vertical separation 1. As x approaches infinity, the angle between them would approach 0 degrees as well. So, the angle has a maximum somewhere in between, which we found to be 30 degrees. Therefore, 30 degrees is indeed the maximum angle.
</execution_6.2>

<execution_6.3>
First, when we set x = h / sqrt(3), which is the distance of runner A from O at time t. So, since x = vt, then vt = h / sqrt(3), so t = h / (v sqrt(3)).

At this time, the positions are:

A: (h / sqrt(3), 0)

B: (3v * h / (v sqrt(3)), 0) = (3h / sqrt(3), 0) = (sqrt(3) h, 0)

P: (0, h)

So, coordinates:

PA vector: from P(0,h) to A(h/sqrt(3),0): (h/sqrt(3), -h)

PB vector: from P(0,h) to B(sqrt(3) h,0): (sqrt(3) h, -h)

Compute the angle between these two vectors.

Compute the dot product:

(h/sqrt(3))(sqrt(3) h) + (-h)(-h) = (h * sqrt(3) h)/sqrt(3) + h² = h² + h² = 2h²

The magnitudes:

|PA| = sqrt( (h/sqrt(3))² + (-h)^2 ) = sqrt( h² / 3 + h² ) = sqrt(4h² / 3 ) = 2h / sqrt(3)

|PB| = sqrt( (sqrt(3) h)^2 + (-h)^2 ) = sqrt(3h² + h² ) = sqrt(4h² ) = 2h

So, cos(theta) = (2h²) / ( (2h / sqrt(3))(2h) ) = (2h²) / (4h² / sqrt(3)) ) = sqrt(3)/2

Therefore, theta = 30 degrees. That seems correct.

But is this the maximum possible angle? Let's consider the positions when A and B are very close to O. Then, angle APB would be small, approaching zero. When A and B are very far away, the angle APB would also approach zero, as the lines PA and PB would be almost parallel. Therefore, there must be a maximum angle somewhere in between, which we found to be 30 degrees.
</execution_6.3>

<execution_6.4>
First, when we set x = h / sqrt(3), which is the distance of runner A from O. Then, runner B is at 3x = h / sqrt(3) * 3 = 3h / sqrt(3) = h*sqrt(3). So, their positions are (h/sqrt(3), 0) and (h*sqrt(3), 0). Then, the distances PA and PB can be computed.

PA distance is sqrt( (h/sqrt(3))^2 + h^2 ) = sqrt( h² / 3 + h² ) = sqrt(4h² / 3) = 2h / sqrt(3)

Similarly, PB distance is sqrt( (h*sqrt(3))^2 + h² ) = sqrt(3h² + h²) = sqrt(4h²) = 2h

Then, in triangle APB, sides PA = 2h / sqrt(3), PB = 2h, and AB = PB - PA = 2h - 2h / sqrt(3). Wait, no. Actually, since both A and B are on the same side of O, the distance between A and B is 3x - x = 2x = 2h / sqrt(3). So, AB = 2h / sqrt(3). So, in triangle APB, sides PA, PB, and AB. But actually, triangle APB is not a straight triangle because points A and B are on the x-axis, and P is on the y-axis. So, the triangle APB is a triangle with vertices at (x,0), (3x,0), and (0,h). The angle at P is the angle between the lines PA and PB.

Alternatively, maybe using the law of cosines in triangle APB. Let's see.

In triangle APB, angle at P. The sides are:

PA = sqrt(x² + h²)

PB = sqrt((3x)^2 + h²)

AB = 3x - x = 2x

Then, by the law of cosines:

AB² = PA² + PB² - 2 PA PB cos(theta)

So,

(2x)^2 = (x² + h²) + (9x² + h²) - 2 sqrt(x² + h²) sqrt(9x² + h²) cos(theta)

Simplify left side: 4x²

Right side: x² + h² + 9x² + h² - 2 sqrt{(x² + h²)(9x² + h²)} cos(theta)

Simplify right side: 10x² + 2h² - 2 sqrt{(x² + h²)(9x² + h²)} cos(theta)

Therefore:

4x² = 10x² + 2h² - 2 sqrt{(x² + h²)(9x² + h²)} cos(theta)

Rearrange:

2 sqrt{(x² + h²)(9x² + h²)} cos(theta) = 10x² + 2h² - 4x² = 6x² + 2h²

Divide both sides by 2:

sqrt{(x² + h²)(9x² + h²)} cos(theta) = 3x² + h²

Therefore,

cos(theta) = (3x² + h²) / sqrt{(x² + h²)(9x² + h²)}

Which is exactly the same expression as before. So, we arrive at the same expression for cos(theta), which we minimized to sqrt(3)/2, leading to theta = 30 degrees.
</execution_6.4>

<execution_6.5>
First, we set up coordinates with O at (0,0), P at (0,h). Then, positions of A and B are (vt, 0) and (3vt, 0). Then, angle APB is the angle between vectors PA and PB. We computed the cosine of that angle as (3x² + h²) / [sqrt(x² + h²) * sqrt(9x² + h²)] where x = vt. Then, we found that the minimal value of this expression occurs when x = h / sqrt(3), leading to cos(theta) = sqrt(3)/2, hence theta = 30 degrees.

But is there a way this could be larger? Let me think. Suppose h is very large compared to x. Then, as h increases, the angle APB might approach some limit. Alternatively, if h is very small, approaching zero, the angle might approach some other limit.

But in our problem, h is fixed (since P is a fixed point), so we need to maximize over t (or x). So, the maximum angle occurs when x = h / sqrt(3), leading to 30 degrees. Therefore, the answer is 30 degrees.

But wait, in the Asymptote code, P is at (0,1), and A is at (0.4,0), B at (1.2,0). If we compute the angle in that diagram, maybe it's different? Wait, but in the diagram, the positions are fixed, but in the problem, the positions are variables as the runners run. So, the Asymptote code is just an illustration with specific values, but the actual problem is to find the maximum possible angle as the runners run, i.e., as x varies. So, in the Asymptote code, if we set h = 1, then x = 1 / sqrt(3) ≈ 0.577. But in the diagram, A is at 0.4 and B at 1.2. So, if x = 0.577, which is between 0.4 and 1.2, that would be the position where the angle is maximized. Therefore, the diagram is just an example, not the maximum case.

Therefore, after thorough analysis, the maximum angle is 30 degrees. So, the answer is 30 degrees.
</execution_6.5>

<execution_6.6>
Wait, but since P is fixed, maybe not. Alternatively, since P is fixed, the angle APB is determined by the positions of A and B. The maximum angle occurs when the derivative with respect to x (distance of A) is zero, which we did.

But according to our calculation, when x = h / sqrt(3), the angle is 30 degrees. Let's confirm with the Asymptote code given.

In the Asymptote code, A is at (0.4,0), B at (1.2,0), O at (0,0), and P at (0,1). So, if h = 1, then according to our result, x should be 1 / sqrt(3) ≈ 0.577. However, in the diagram, A is at 0.4 and B at 1.2. So, maybe the diagram is not to scale. If we compute the angle in the diagram, with h = 1, x = 0.4 for A, then:

Compute cos(theta) for x = 0.4:

Numerator: 3*(0.4)^2 + 1 = 3*0.16 + 1 = 0.48 + 1 = 1.48

Denominator: sqrt(0.4^2 + 1) * sqrt(9*(0.4)^2 + 1) = sqrt(0.16 + 1) * sqrt(1.44 + 1) = sqrt(1.16) * sqrt(2.44) ≈ 1.077 * 1.562 ≈ 1.682

So, cos(theta) ≈ 1.48 / 1.682 ≈ 0.88, which corresponds to an angle of arccos(0.88) ≈ 28.3 degrees. Which is close to 30 degrees, but not exactly. However, this might be due to the specific values in the diagram. Since the problem states that the observer is at point P such that OP is perpendicular to the track, but doesn't fix the height h. However, in the Asymptote code, h is 1. But perhaps the actual problem allows h to be any value, but since the maximum angle is achieved when x = h / sqrt(3), the angle is 30 degrees regardless of h. Let's check.

Suppose h is arbitrary. Let’s set h = sqrt(3). Then x = sqrt(3) / sqrt(3) = 1. Then, compute cos(theta):

Numerator: 3*(1)^2 + (sqrt(3))^2 = 3 + 3 = 6

Denominator: sqrt(1^2 + (sqrt(3))^2) * sqrt(9*1^2 + (sqrt(3))^2) = sqrt(1 + 3) * sqrt(9 + 3) = sqrt(4) * sqrt(12) = 2 * 2*sqrt(3) = 4*sqrt(3)

Therefore, cos(theta) = 6 / (4*sqrt(3)) = (3)/(2*sqrt(3)) = sqrt(3)/2, which gives theta = 30 degrees. So, regardless of h, the angle is 30 degrees when x = h / sqrt(3). Therefore, the maximum angle is 30 degrees.

Alternatively, parametrize the angle APB in terms of t and take derivative.

Given that angle APB is theta, then tan(theta/2) would be the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side in the triangle formed by the angle bisector. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, since we have coordinates, we can use the formula for the angle between two lines.

The angle between PA and PB can be calculated using the slopes of PA and PB.

Coordinates:

PA goes from P(0, h) to A(vt, 0). The slope of PA is (0 - h)/(vt - 0) = -h / (vt)

Similarly, slope of PB is (0 - h)/(3vt - 0) = -h / (3vt)

The angle between the two lines can be found using the formula:

tan(theta) = |(m2 - m1)/(1 + m1*m2)|

Where m1 and m2 are the slopes.

So, substituting:

tan(theta) = |( (-h/(3vt)) - (-h/(vt)) ) / (1 + (-h/(vt))*(-h/(3vt)) )|

Simplify numerator:

(-h/(3vt) + h/(vt)) = ( (-1/3 + 1 )h / vt ) = (2/3 h / vt )

Denominator:

1 + (h^2)/(3v²t²)

Therefore,

tan(theta) = | (2h/(3vt)) / (1 + h²/(3v²t²)) | = (2h/(3vt)) / (1 + h²/(3v²t²))

Multiply numerator and denominator by 3v²t²:

= (2h/(3vt) * 3v²t²) / (3v²t² + h²) = (2h * vt) / (3v²t² + h²)

So, tan(theta) = (2hvt) / (3v²t² + h²)

But we need to maximize theta, which is equivalent to maximizing tan(theta). So, let's maximize (2hvt)/(3v²t² + h²)

Let’s denote this expression as k(t) = (2hvt)/(3v²t² + h²)

To find the maximum of k(t), take derivative with respect to t:

k’(t) = [2hv(3v²t² + h²) - (2hvt)(6v²t)] / (3v²t² + h²)^2

Set numerator equal to zero:

2hv(3v²t² + h²) - (2hvt)(6v²t) = 0

Factor out 2hv:

2hv[3v²t² + h² - 6v²t²] = 0

Since 2hv ≠ 0, we have:

3v²t² + h² - 6v²t² = 0

Simplify:

-3v²t² + h² = 0 => 3v²t² = h² => t² = h²/(3v²) => t = h/(v sqrt(3))

So, t = h/(v sqrt(3)), which is the same as x = vt = v*(h/(v sqrt(3))) = h / sqrt(3), which matches our previous result.

Therefore, substituting t = h/(v sqrt(3)) into k(t):

k(t) = (2hv * h/(v sqrt(3))) / (3v²*(h²/(3v²)) + h²) = (2h² / sqrt(3)) / (h² + h²) = (2h² / sqrt(3)) / (2h²) = 1 / sqrt(3)

Therefore, tan(theta) = 1/sqrt(3), which implies theta = arctan(1/sqrt(3)) = 30 degrees.

Therefore, the maximum angle is 30 degrees.

Suppose h = 1 for simplicity. Then, maximum angle occurs when x = 1 / sqrt(3). So, positions of A and B are (1/sqrt(3), 0) and (3/sqrt(3), 0) = (sqrt(3), 0). Then, point P is at (0,1).

Compute angle APB. Let's compute vectors PA and PB.

PA = (1/sqrt(3), -1)

PB = (sqrt(3), -1)

Compute the angle between these two vectors.

Dot product: (1/sqrt(3))(sqrt(3)) + (-1)(-1) = 1 + 1 = 2

|PA| = sqrt( (1/sqrt(3))² + (-1)^2 ) = sqrt(1/3 + 1) = sqrt(4/3) = 2/sqrt(3)

|PB| = sqrt( (sqrt(3))² + (-1)^2 ) = sqrt(3 + 1) = sqrt(4) = 2

Therefore, cos(theta) = 2 / ( (2/sqrt(3)) * 2 ) = 2 / (4 / sqrt(3)) ) = (2 * sqrt(3)) / 4 = sqrt(3)/2

Therefore, theta = 30 degrees.

Alternatively, when the angle is maximized, the point P, A, B are such that the derivative of the angle with respect to x is zero. Which is what we did.

Alternatively, perhaps using triangle properties. For a given triangle with two sides from P, the angle is maximized when the opposite side is maximized? Wait, not necessarily. The angle depends on the ratio of sides.

Alternatively, maybe using the law of cosines. Wait, we did use that.

Alternatively, perhaps parametric differentiation. But since we already did calculus and verified, perhaps it's correct.

But let's check with specific numbers. Suppose h = sqrt(3). Then, x = h / sqrt(3) = 1. So, positions of A is (1,0), B is (3,0). Then, vectors PA = (1, -sqrt(3)), PB = (3, -sqrt(3)).

Compute the angle between these vectors.

Dot product: 1*3 + (-sqrt(3))*(-sqrt(3)) = 3 + 3 = 6

|PA| = sqrt(1 + 3) = 2

|PB| = sqrt(9 + 3) = sqrt(12) = 2*sqrt(3)

So, cos(theta) = 6 / (2 * 2*sqrt(3)) ) = 6 / (4*sqrt(3)) = (3)/(2*sqrt(3)) = sqrt(3)/2, so theta = 30 degrees. Correct.

If h is different, say h = 1. Then x = 1 / sqrt(3). Then, positions of A is (1/sqrt(3), 0), B is (3/sqrt(3), 0) = (sqrt(3), 0). Then, vectors PA = (1/sqrt(3), -1), PB = (sqrt(3), -1)

Compute the dot product: (1/sqrt(3))(sqrt(3)) + (-1)(-1) = 1 + 1 = 2

|PA| = sqrt( (1/3) + 1 ) = sqrt(4/3) = 2/sqrt(3)

|PB| = sqrt( 3 + 1 ) = 2

Therefore, cos(theta) = 2 / ( (2/sqrt(3)) * 2 ) = 2 / (4 / sqrt(3)) ) = (2 * sqrt(3)) / 4 = sqrt(3)/2, so theta = 30 degrees. Correct. So regardless of h, the angle is 30 degrees.

Therefore, the maximum angle is 30 degrees. Therefore, the answer is 30 degrees.

But the problem says "Find the maximum of angle APB, in degrees". So, the maximum angle is 30 degrees.

But let me think again. If the runners are moving, then as they move away, the angle APB would change. But according to the calculations, regardless of how far they run, as long as they maintain their speed ratio, the maximum angle is 30 degrees. That seems counter-intuitive at first, but when you compute it, it's consistent.

Alternatively, when the runners are very close to O, the angle APB would be small. As they move away, the angle increases to a maximum of 30 degrees, then decreases again as they go further away. So, 30 degrees is indeed the maximum.

Therefore, the answer is 30 degrees.

**Final Answer**
The maximum angle \( \angle APB \) is \(\boxed{30}\) degrees.

Wait, when we found that the maximum angle is 30 degrees, which is pi/6 radians. But let me check if this is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me retrace.

Wait, in the expression for f(x), when we substitute x = h / sqrt(3):

3x² + h² = 3*(h² / 3) + h² = h² + h² = 2h². Correct.

sqrt(x² + h²) = sqrt( h² / 3 + h² ) = sqrt(4h² / 3) = 2h / sqrt(3). Correct.

sqrt(9x² + h²) = sqrt(9*(h² / 3) + h²) = sqrt(3h² + h²) = sqrt(4h²) = 2h. Correct.

Thus, denominator is (2h / sqrt(3)) * 2h = 4h² / sqrt(3). Correct.

So, f(x) = 2h² / (4h² / sqrt(3)) ) = (2 / 4) * sqrt(3) = (1/2) sqrt(3). So, cos(theta) = sqrt(3)/2, so theta = 30 degrees. That seems correct.

But let me think, if the angle is 30 degrees, is that the maximum possible? Because depending on the position of P, maybe the angle can be larger. Wait, but according to the calculation, when the derivative is zero, that's the maximum. Since the angle increases to that point and then decreases, it's indeed the maximum.
