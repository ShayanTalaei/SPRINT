Okay, so I need to figure out how many ways the letters of the word "ELLIPSE" can be arranged. Let me start by recalling that when dealing with permutations of letters in a word with repeating letters, the formula involves factorials divided by the product of the factorials of the counts of each repeating letter.

First, I should check how many letters are in "ELLIPSE" and identify any repeating letters. Let me spell it out: E, L, L, I, P, S, E. Wait, that's 7 letters. Let me count again: E (1), L (2), L (3), I (4), P (5), S (6), E (7). Hmm, so there are 7 letters in total. But some letters are repeated. Let me list them out:

- E appears twice.
- L appears twice.
- The rest (I, P, S) each appear once.
- Wait, is that correct? Let me check again. The word "ELLIPSE" is E-L-L-I-P-S-E. So yes, E is at the beginning and end, L is twice, and the others are single.

Based on execution_1.1:
So, the total number of letters is 7. If all letters were distinct, the number of arrangements would be 7! (which is 5040). But since there are repetitions, we need to adjust for that.

The formula for permutations of multiset is:

Total arrangements = n! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk! )

Where n is the total number of items, and n1, n2, etc.

<prompt_2.1> Apply the multiset permutation formula to the word "ELLIPSE" using the identified letter counts. </prompt_2.1>

Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any letters. Let's spell ELLIPSE again: E, L, L, I, P, S, E.
That's 7 letters. The letters and their counts: E:2, L:2, I:1, P:1, S:1.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as first choosing positions for the E's and then the L's, and the rest are unique.
So total letters: 7. Choose 2 positions for E's: C(7,2). Then from the remaining 5 positions, choose 2 for L's: C(5,2). Then the remaining 3 letters (I, P, S) can be arranged in 3!

<prompt_2.2> Verify the result using an alternative method by considering combinations for letter positions. </prompt_2.2>

are the numbers of each repeated item.

In this case, n = 7 (total letters). The repeating letters are E and L, each appearing twice. The rest are unique, so their counts are 1, which don't affect the denominator since 1! is 1. So plugging into the formula:

Total arrangements = 7! / (2! * 2! )

Let me compute that. 7! is 5040. 2! is 2, so 2*2=4. Then 5040 divided by 4 is 1260.

ways. So the calculation would be C(7,2)*C(5,2)*3! .

Calculating that: C(7,2) is 21, C(5,2) is 10, and 3! is 6. So 21*10=210, 210*6=1260.

Based on execution_2.1:
Wait, is that right? Let me verify. Let's see, if there are two E's and two L's, then swapping the E's or the L's would result in the same arrangement.
So dividing by 2! for the E's and 2! for the L's makes sense. So yes, 7! divided by (2! * 2! ) should give the correct number.

But hold on, let me check if there are any other repeating letters.

<prompt_3.1> Verify the calculation of the number of arrangements by ensuring all possible errors have been considered. </prompt_3.1>

Based on execution_2.2:
Therefore, I think the answer is 1260. Let me just confirm once more. Maybe using another approach.

<execution_3.1>
The word is ELLIPSE. E is twice, L is twice, and the rest (I, P, S) are single. So yes, only two letters are repeated twice. So the calculation should be correct.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
Suppose we consider all permutations and then divide by the permutations of the repeated letters.

Total permutations without considering duplicates: 7! . Then, since the two E's are indistinct, we divide by 2! , and similarly for the L's, divide by another 2! . So 7! / (2! * 2! ) = 5040 / 4 = 1260. Yep, same result. So that seems consistent.

Alternatively, if I list out the letters and think of arranging them step by step. The first letter can be any of the 7, the second any of the remaining 6, and so on. But since some letters are the same, many of these arrangements would be duplicates. Hence, the division by the factorials for the duplicates.

<Final_answer>
Therefore, the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word ELLIPSE is $\boxed{1260}$.
