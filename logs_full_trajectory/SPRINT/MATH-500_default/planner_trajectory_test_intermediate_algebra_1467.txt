Okay, so I need to simplify this expression where both the numerator and the denominator are products of terms like (k^4 + 1/4). The numerator is the product from k=2 to 2n of ( (2k)^4 + 1/4 ), and the denominator is the product from k=1 to 2n-1 of (k^4 + 1/4) but only the odd numbers, right? Wait, actually, let me check.

<prompt_1.1> Confirm the structure of the numerator and denominator based on the given expression. </prompt_1.1>

Hmm. That seems complicated. Maybe I can factor each term in the numerator and denominator. Let me recall that x^4 + 1/4 can be factored somehow. Wait, x^4 + 1 is a sum of squares, but here it's x^4 + 1/4, which is similar but with a coefficient. Maybe there's a way to factor this quartic expression.

The numerator is (2^4 + 1/4)(4^4 + 1/4)... ((2n)^4 + 1/4). So those are even numbers from 2 to 2n. The denominator is (1^4 + 1/4)(3^4 + 1/4)... ((2n - 1)^4 + 1/4), which are odd numbers from 1 to 2n - 1. So both products are over the same number of terms, right? The numerator has terms for even numbers and the denominator for odd numbers, each raised to the fourth power plus 1/4.

Let me think. There's a formula for x^4 + 4y^4, which factors into (x^2 + 2xy + 2y^2)(x^2 - 2xy + 2y^2). Maybe I can use something similar here. If I write x^4 + 1/4 as x^4 + (1/√2)^4 * 2, but that might not help. Wait, let me try to adjust the formula.

Suppose I set 4y^4 = 1/4. Then y^4 = 1/16, so y = 1/2. Then x^4 + 1/4 = x^4 + 4*(1/2)^4. Using the formula, that would factor into (x^2 + 2*x*(1/2) + 2*(1/2)^2)(x^2 - 2*x*(1/2) + 2*(1/2)^2). Let's compute that:

First factor: x^2 + x + 2*(1/4) = x^2 + x + 1/2

Second factor: x^2 - x + 1/2

So, x^4 + 1/4 = (x^2 + x + 1/2)(x^2 - x + 1/2). Hmm, okay, that seems to work. Let me check with x=2: (16 + 1/4) = 16.25. The factors would be (4 + 2 + 0.5)(4 - 2 + 0.5) = (6.5)(2.5) = 16.25.

Based on execution_1.2:
Great, so that factors each term in the numerator and denominator.

Therefore, each term in the numerator, which is ((2k)^4 + 1/4), can be written as ((2k)^2 + (2k) + 1/2)((2k)^2 - (2k) + 1/2). Let me compute that:

<prompt_2.1> Factor each term in the numerator using the factored form of x^4 + 1/4. </prompt_2.1>

Similarly, each term in the denominator is ( (2k - 1)^4 + 1/4 ), which factors as ( (2k - 1)^2 + (2k - 1) + 1/2 )( (2k - 1)^2 - (2k - 1) + 1/2 ). Let me compute those quadratics:

First factor: (2k - 1)^2 + (2k - 1) + 1/2 = 4k^2 - 4k + 1 + 2k - 1 + 1/2 = 4k^2 - 2k + 1/2

Second factor: (2k - 1)^2 - (2k - 1) + 1/2 = 4k^2 - 4k + 1 - 2k + 1 + 1/2 = 4k^2 - 6k + 2.5
Wait, let me check again:

Based on execution_1.1:
Wait, let me confirm with an example. Let's take n=1. Then the numerator is (2^4 +1/4)=16 +1/4=16.25.

<execution_2.1>
First factor: (2k)^2 + (2k) + 1/2 = 4k^2 + 2k + 1/2

Second factor: (2k)^2 - (2k) + 1/2 = 4k^2 - 2k + 1/2
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
First factor: (2k - 1)^2 = 4k² - 4k + 1. Then add (2k - 1): 4k² - 4k + 1 + 2k - 1 = 4k² - 2k. Then add 1/2: 4k² - 2k + 1/2.

Second factor: (2k - 1)^2 = 4k² - 4k + 1. Subtract (2k - 1): 4k² - 4k + 1 - 2k + 1 = 4k² - 6k + 2. Then add 1/2: 4k² - 6k + 2.5.

The denominator is (1^4 +1/4)=1 +1/4=1.25. So 16.25/1.25=13. Let's see if the formula gives 13 when n=1: 2^(2n+1) + something? Wait, 2^(2*1+1)=8, which is 8, but 13 is 16 +1. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, but for n=1, the simplified expression is 13, which is 8*2 + 5? Hmm, not sure. Let's check n=2.

For n=2, numerator is (2^4 +1/4)(4^4 +1/4)=16.25*(256 +0.25)=16.25*256.25. Denominator is (1^4 +1/4)(3^4 +1/4)=1.25*(81 +0.25)=1.25*81.25. Compute numerator: 16.25*256.25. Let's compute that: 16*256=4096, 16*0.25=4, 0.25*256=64, 0.25*0.25=0.0625. So total is 4096 +4 +64 +0.0625=4164.0625. Denominator:1.25*81.25=101.5625. So 4164.0625 /101.5625=41. So 41. Let's see, 2^(2*2 +1) +1=32 +1=33. Not 41. Hmm. Wait, 2^(2n+1) is 32, but 41 is 32 +9. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, 41 is actually (2^(2n+1) + something). Alternatively, 41 is 8*5 +1. Not sure. Wait, maybe the formula is different. Wait, for n=1, the result was 13, which is 8*1 +5, and for n=2, 13*3.166...? Hmm, not obvious. Wait, but the problem says to simplify the expression, so maybe the product telescopes to something like (2^{2n+1} +1)/5. Let's check.

For n=1: (2^3 +1)/5=(8 +1)/5=9/5=1.8, which is not 13. Hmm, that's not matching. Wait, maybe (2^{2n+1} -1)/ something. For n=1: 16 -1=15, 15/5=3, not 13. Hmm. Maybe (2^{4n+2} +1)/5? For n=1: 2^6 +1=65, 65/5=13. For n=2: 2^{10} +1=1024 +1=1025, 1025/5=205. Wait, but when n=2, the result was 41. So that's not matching. Hmm. So maybe my initial assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the product telescopes in such a way that most terms cancel out, leaving a product of linear terms. Let me think about how the factors in numerator and denominator might cancel. Since each term in the numerator is factored into two quadratics, and each term in the denominator is also factored into two quadratics. Maybe when we write out the entire product, there's a cancellation happening across consecutive terms.

Let me try writing out the first few terms for n=2.

Numerator for n=2: [(2^2 +2 +1/2)(2^2 -2 +1/2)] = [(4 +2 +0.5)(4 -2 +0.5)] = [6.5][2.5]

Similarly, next term (4^4 +1/4) factors into [(16 +4 +0.5)(16 -4 +0.5)] = [20.5][12.5]

Denominator for n=2: [(1^2 +1 +0.5)(1^2 -1 +0.5)] = [(1 +1 +0.5)(1 -1 +0.5)] = [2.5][0.5]

Next term (3^4 +1/4) factors into [(9 +3 +0.5)(9 -3 +0.5)] = [12.5][6.5]

So the numerator product is [6.5][2.5] * [20.5][12.5]

Denominator product is [2.5][0.5] * [12.5][6.5]

So when we write the ratio, we have:

(6.5 * 2.5 * 20.5 * 12.5) / (2.5 * 0.5 * 12.5 * 6.5) = (20.5) / (0.5) = 41. Which matches the earlier calculation.

Based on execution_2.1:
So the entire numerator product becomes the product from k=1 to n of [(4k^2 + 2k + 1/2)(4k^2 - 2k + 1/2)].

Based on execution_1.1:
Similarly, the denominator is the product of ( (2k - 1)^4 + 1/4 ) from k=1 to n, which factors into the product from k=1 to n of [ ( (2k - 1)^2 + (2k - 1) + 1/2 )( (2k - 1)^2 - (2k - 1) + 1/2 ) ].

Based on execution_2.1, execution_2.2:
So, putting it all together, the entire expression is the product from k=1 to n of [ (4k^2 + 2k + 1/2)(4k^2 - 2k + 1/2) ] divided by the product from k=1 to n of [ (4k^2 - 4k + 1.5)(4k^2 - 6k + 2.5) ].

Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe there's a telescoping nature here. Let me look for terms that can cancel out across consecutive factors.

Based on execution_2.3:
So for n=1: 20.5 / 0.5 = 41, which is 2^(2*2 +1) +1=32 +1=33. Hmm, no. Wait, 41 is actually (2^5 +1)/ something? 2^5=32, 32 +1=33. Not 41. Wait, 41 is a prime number. Hmm. Wait, maybe the product telescopes such that each denominator term cancels with a numerator term from the next product. Wait, let me see:

Looking at the numerator terms:

<prompt_3.2> Confirm the simplified expression by analyzing the cancellation pattern. </prompt_3.2>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
Let me write out the factors for a few terms to see if a pattern emerges.

Take k=1 in the numerator:

First factor: 4(1)^2 + 2(1) + 1/2 = 4 + 2 + 0.5 = 6.5

Second factor: 4(1)^2 - 2(1) + 1/2 = 4 - 2 + 0.5 = 2.5

Similarly, k=2:

First factor: 4(4) + 4 + 0.5 = 16 + 4 + 0.5 = 20.5

Second factor: 4(4) - 4 + 0.5 = 16 - 4 + 0.5 = 12.5

k=3:

First factor: 4(9) + 6 + 0.5 = 36 + 6 + 0.5 = 42.5

Second factor: 4(9) - 6 + 0.5 = 36 - 6 + 0.5 = 30.5

Denominator terms for k=1:

First factor: 4(1)^2 - 4(1) + 1.5 = 4 - 4 + 1.5 = 1.5

Second factor: 4(1)^2 - 6(1) + 2.5 = 4 - 6 + 2.5 = 0.5

For k=2:

First factor: 4(4) - 8 + 1.5 = 16 - 8 + 1.5 = 9.5

Second factor: 4(4) - 12 + 2.5 = 16 - 12 + 2.5 = 6.5

k=3:

First factor: 4(9) - 12 + 1.5 = 36 - 12 + 1.5 = 25.5

Second factor: 4(9) - 18 + 2.5 = 36 - 18 + 2.5 = 20.5
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
For k=1: (4*1^2 + 2*1 + 0.5) = 6.5 and (4*1^2 - 2*1 + 0.5) = 2.5

For k=2: (4*4 + 4 + 0.5)=20.5 and (4*4 -4 +0.5)=12.5

Denominator terms:

For k=1: (4*1 -4 +1.5)=1.5 and (4*1 -6 +2.5)=0.5

For k=2: (4*4 -8 +1.5)=20.5 and (4*4 -12 +2.5)=12.5

Wait, so denominator for k=1: 1.5 and 0.5; for k=2: 20.5 and 12.5

But the numerator for k=1: 6.5 and 2.5; for k=2: 20.5 and 12.5

So when we take the ratio, the 20.5 and 12.5 from the numerators of k=2 cancel with the denominators of k=2. But the 6.5 and 2.5 from k=1 in the numerator don't cancel with anything in the denominator except the 0.5. Wait, denominator for k=1 has 1.5 and 0.5. So 6.5/1.5 and 2.5/0.5. Then 6.5/1.5 is 13/3 and 2.5/0.5 is 5. Then multiply by 20.5/20.5 and 12.5/12.5 which cancels. So overall, (13/3)*5 = 65/3 ≈ 21.666...., but when n=2, the actual value was 41. Wait, that contradicts. Wait, maybe my calculation is wrong.

Wait, for n=2, numerator is (2^4 +1/4)(4^4 +1/4) = 16.25 * 256.25 = 16.25*256.25. Let me compute that again. 16*256=4096, 16*0.25=4, 0.25*256=64, 0.25*0.25=0.0625. So total is 4096 + 4 + 64 + 0.0625 = 4164.0625. Denominator is (1^4 +1/4)(3^4 +1/4)=1.25*81.25=101.5625. So 4164.0625 /101.5625=41. So 41. But according to the cancellation idea, we have (6.5 /1.5)*(2.5 /0.5)*(20.5 /20.5)*(12.5 /12.5)= (6.5/1.5)*(2.5/0.5)= (4.333...)*(5)=21.666...., which is not 41. So my earlier thought about cancellation is incorrect. So perhaps there's another pattern.

Wait, perhaps each numerator term after the first cancels with a denominator term from the previous step? Wait, for k=1 in numerator: 6.5 and 2.5. Denominator for k=1:1.5 and 0.5. Then for k=2 in numerator:20.5 and 12.5. Denominator for k=2:20.5 and 12.5. Wait, so the numerator of k=2 is the same as the denominator of k=2. So they cancel. Wait, but in the denominator for k=2, we have (4k^2 -4k +1.5) and (4k^2 -6k +2.5). For k=2, that's (16 -8 +1.5)=9.5 and (16 -12 +2.5)=6.5. Wait, hold on, earlier I computed denominator for k=2 as 20.5 and 12.5, but that seems wrong. Wait, let's recalculate.

Wait, denominator terms are ( (2k -1)^2 + (2k -1) + 0.5 ) and ( (2k -1)^2 - (2k -1) + 0.5 ). For k=2, 2k -1=3. So first factor: 3^2 +3 +0.5=9 +3 +0.5=12.5. Second factor:9 -3 +0.5=6.5. So denominator for k=2 is 12.5 and 6.5. Similarly, numerator for k=2 is (4*(2)^2 +2*2 +0.5)=16 +4 +0.5=20.5 and (4*4 -4 +0.5)=16 -4 +0.5=12.5. So numerator for k=2 is 20.5 and 12.5, denominator for k=2 is 12.5 and 6.5. So when we take the ratio for k=2, it's (20.5/12.5)*(12.5/6.5)=20.5/6.5≈3.1538. But 20.5/6.5=41/13≈3.1538. Then for k=1, numerator is 6.5/1.5≈4.3333 and 2.5/0.5=5. So total ratio is (6.5/1.5)*(2.5/0.5)*(20.5/12.5)*(12.5/6.5). Wait, but the 12.5 in numerator k=2 cancels with the 12.5 in denominator k=2? Wait, no, denominator for k=2 has 12.5 and 6.5, numerator for k=2 has 20.5 and 12.5. So the 12.5 cancels, leaving 20.5/6.5. Then the 6.5 in denominator k=2 is separate. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me write it step by step.

For n=2:

Numerator:
- k=1: (4*1^2 +2*1 +0.5)=6.5 and (4*1^2 -2*1 +0.5)=2.5
- k=2: (4*4 +4 +0.5)=20.5 and (4*4 -4 +0.5)=12.5

Denominator:
- k=1: (3^2 +3 +0.5)=12.5 and (3^2 -3 +0.5)=6.5
- k=2: (5^2 +5 +0.5)=30.5 and (5^2 -5 +0.5)=12.5 (Wait, no, wait. Wait, for k=2 in denominator, (2k -1)=3, so the factors are 3^2 +3 +0.5=12.5 and 3^2 -3 +0.5=6.5. Wait, but earlier I thought for k=2, denominator factors were 12.5 and 6.5, but when I compute (2k -1)^2 + (2k -1) +0.5, that's 9 +3 +0.5=12.5, and 9 -3 +0.5=6.5. So denominator terms for k=2 are 12.5 and 6.5. Similarly, numerator terms for k=2 are 20.5 and 12.5. So when we take the ratio:

Numerator product: 6.5 * 2.5 * 20.5 * 12.5

Denominator product: 12.5 * 6.5 * 12.5 * 6.5

Wait, no. Wait, denominator for k=1:12.5 and 6.5. Denominator for k=2:12.5 and 6.5. So denominator product is 12.5 *6.5 *12.5 *6.5. Numerator product is 6.5 *2.5 *20.5 *12.5. So:

Ratio = (6.5 *2.5 *20.5 *12.5) / (12.5 *6.5 *12.5 *6.5) = (2.5 *20.5) / (12.5 *6.5) = (51.25) / (81.25) = 0.6275... Wait, that's not 41. Wait, this is conflicting with my previous calculation. Wait, what's going on here.

Wait, no, actually, when n=2, the denominator is product from k=1 to 2 of ( (2k -1)^4 +1/4 ). So for k=1:1^4 +1/4=1.25, which factors into 12.5 and 6.5. For k=2:3^4 +1/4=81 +0.25=81.25, which factors into 81.25= (9 +3 +0.5)(9 -3 +0.5)=12.5*6.5. So denominator product is 12.5*6.5*12.5*6.5. Wait, but 12.5*6.5 is 81.25, so denominator is 81.25^2. Numerator for n=2 is (2^4 +1/4)(4^4 +1/4)=16.25*256.25. Which factors into (4 +2 +0.5)(4 -2 +0.5)*(16 +4 +0.5)(16 -4 +0.5)=6.5*2.5*20.5*12.5. So numerator product is 6.5*2.5*20.5*12.5. Denominator is 12.5*6.5*12.5*6.5. Therefore, the ratio is (6.5*2.5*20.5*12.5)/(12.5*6.5*12.5*6.5) = (2.5*20.5)/(12.5*6.5) = (51.25)/(81.25) = 0.6275... which is 51.25 divided by 81.25. But 51.25/81.25 simplifies to 20.5/32.5, which is 41/65≈0.6307... Hmm, but earlier calculation when plugging in actual numbers gave 41. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, my factoring approach must be wrong.

Wait, hold on. Let me check the factoring again. The original expression is x^4 +1/4. I used the formula for a^4 +4b^4, but here it's x^4 +1/4, which is x^4 +4*(1/4)^1. Wait, the formula is a^4 +4b^4 = (a^2 +2ab +sqrt(2)b^2)(a^2 -2ab +sqrt(2)b^2). But in our case, x^4 +1/4 = x^4 +4*(1/4)^1. Wait, but 1/4 is 4*(1/4). Wait, maybe the formula is different. Let me check the factorization again.

Let me recall that x^4 + 4y^4 can be factored as (x^2 + 2xy + 2y^2)(x^2 - 2xy + 2y^2). So if we set y = (1/2), then 4y^4 = 4*(1/2)^4 = 4*(1/16) = 1/4. So x^4 +1/4 = x^4 +4*(1/2)^4. Therefore, using the formula, that factors into (x^2 + 2*(x)*(1/2) + 2*(1/2)^2)(x^2 - 2*(x)*(1/2) + 2*(1/2)^2). Let's compute that:

First factor: x^2 + x + 0.5

Second factor: x^2 - x + 0.5

Yes, that's correct. So x^4 +1/4 factors into (x^2 +x +0.5)(x^2 -x +0.5). So that part was correct.

Therefore, the numerator terms for even k=2n: (2k)^4 +1/4 factors into (4k^2 +2k +0.5)(4k^2 -2k +0.5). Similarly, denominator terms (2k -1)^4 +1/4 factors into ((2k -1)^2 + (2k -1) +0.5)((2k -1)^2 - (2k -1) +0.5). Let's compute those quadratics again:

For numerator even k:

First factor:4k² +2k +0.5

Second factor:4k² -2k +0.5

For denominator odd k:

First factor: (2k -1)^2 + (2k -1) +0.5 =4k² -4k +1 +2k -1 +0.5=4k² -2k +0.5

Second factor: (2k -1)^2 - (2k -1) +0.5=4k² -4k +1 -2k +1 +0.5=4k² -6k +2.5

Wait, so denominator factors are 4k² -2k +0.5 and 4k² -6k +2.5. Numerator factors are 4k² +2k +0.5 and 4k² -2k +0.5. Therefore, in the numerator, for each k, we have (4k² +2k +0.5)(4k² -2k +0.5). In the denominator, for each k, we have (4k² -2k +0.5)(4k² -6k +2.5). Therefore, when we take the ratio, the (4k² -2k +0.5) terms cancel out for each k. So the entire product simplifies to the product over k=1 to n of (4k² +2k +0.5) divided by (4k² -6k +2.5).

Wait, is that correct? Let me check. For each k, the numerator has (4k² +2k +0.5)(4k² -2k +0.5) and the denominator has (4k² -2k +0.5)(4k² -6k +2.5). So indeed, the (4k² -2k +0.5) terms cancel, leaving the product of (4k² +2k +0.5) divided by (4k² -6k +2.5) for each k. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to the product from k=1 to n of [ (4k² +2k +0.5) / (4k² -6k +2.5) ].

Now, perhaps this new product can be further simplified. Let's look at each term:

(4k² +2k +0.5)/(4k² -6k +2.5). Let's try to factor numerator and denominator or see if they can be expressed in a telescoping form.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write each term as a ratio of linear functions. Let me try to express each term as a product of consecutive terms. Let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write 4k² +2k +0.5 as (2k + a)(2k + b) + c, but maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, let's try to write each term as (Ak + B)/(Ck + D). Let's see:

Let me denote numerator as Nk =4k² +2k +0.5 and denominator as Dk=4k² -6k +2.5.

Let me compute Nk / Dk = [4k² +2k +0.5]/[4k² -6k +2.5]. Let me divide numerator and denominator by k² (assuming k ≠0):

= [4 + 2/k + 0.5/k²] / [4 -6/k +2.5/k²]

But this might not help. Alternatively, perhaps perform polynomial division or express as a constant plus something.

Alternatively, let me write Nk =4k² +2k +0.5 and Dk=4k² -6k +2.5. Let me compute Nk - Dk = (4k² +2k +0.5) - (4k² -6k +2.5) =8k -2. So Nk = Dk +8k -2.

Therefore, Nk / Dk =1 + (8k -2)/Dk. Not sure if helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps express Nk and Dk in terms of (2k + a)(2k + b). Let's try:

Nk=4k² +2k +0.5. Let me see if this quadratic can be factored. Let's compute discriminant: b² -4ac=4 -4*4*0.5=4 -8= -4. So roots are complex. Similarly for Dk=4k² -6k +2.5. Discriminant=36 -40= -4. Also complex. So they don't factor over real numbers. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps write each term as a ratio of terms that telescope. Let me think. Suppose we can write Nk/Dk as (Ak + B)/(Ck + D) and see if the product telescopes.

Alternatively, consider writing each term as ( (2k + 0.5)^2 + something ) / ( (2k - 2)^2 + something ). Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps note that:

Let me compute Nk =4k² +2k +0.5=4k² +2k +0.5

Let me see if this can be written as (2k + a)^2 + b.

(2k +a)^2=4k² +4ak +a². Comparing to Nk=4k² +2k +0.5:

4a=2 =>a=0.5. Then a²=0.25. So (2k +0.5)^2=4k² +2k +0.25. Then Nk=(2k +0.5)^2 +0.25. Similarly, Dk=4k² -6k +2.5. Let's complete the square:

4k² -6k +2.5=4(k² -1.5k) +2.5. Complete the square inside:

k² -1.5k + (1.5/2)^2 - (1.5/2)^2= (k - 0.75)^2 -0.5625. Therefore, 4(k² -1.5k) +2.5=4[(k -0.75)^2 -0.5625] +2.5=4(k -0.75)^2 -2.25 +2.5=4(k -0.75)^2 +0.25. So Dk=4(k -0.75)^2 +0.25.

So Nk=(2k +0.5)^2 +0.25 and Dk=4(k -0.75)^2 +0.25. Not sure if helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps express Nk and Dk in terms of each other. Let's see:

From Nk=4k² +2k +0.5 and Dk=4k² -6k +2.5. Let me subtract Dk from Nk:

Nk - Dk=8k -2. So Nk = Dk +8k -2. Therefore, Nk/Dk=1 + (8k -2)/Dk. Still not helpful.

Alternatively, let's compute the first few terms for n=1,2,3 and see if a pattern emerges.

For n=1:

The simplified expression is (2^2 +1)/ (1^2 +1) =5/2. Wait, but earlier calculation was 2.5. Wait, but 5/2=2.5, so that's correct.

For n=2, as we saw, the result was 41. Let's check with the telescoped product:

If we have product from k=1 to 2 of [ (4k² +2k +0.5)/(4k² -6k +2.5) ].

For k=1: (4 +2 +0.5)/(4 -6 +2.5)=6.5/0.5=13

For k=2: (16 +4 +0.5)/(16 -12 +2.5)=20.5/6.5≈3.1538

So product is 13 * (20.5/6.5)=13*(3.1538)=41. So 13*(20.5/6.5)=13*(41/13)=41. Ah! So 20.5/6.5=41/13. Therefore,

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3:
Wait, so for each k, the term is (4k² +2k +0.5)/(4k² -6k +2.5). For k=1, that's 6.5/0.5=13. For k=2, 20.5/6.5≈3.1538. Which is 41/13. So 13*(41/13)=41. Therefore, the product telescopes such that each denominator cancels with the numerator of the next term. Wait, but how?

Wait, let's check for k=1 and k=2:

For k=1:

Numerator:6.5

Denominator:0.5

For k=2:

Numerator:20.5

Denominator:6.5

So when we take the product for n=2, it's (6.5/0.5)*(20.5/6.5) = (6.5*20.5)/(0.5*6.5) =20.5/0.5=41. So the 6.5 in the numerator cancels with the 6.5 in the denominator of the next term. So the product telescopes such that all intermediate terms cancel, leaving only the last numerator and the first denominator. Wait, for n=2, the product is:

(6.5/0.5) * (20.5/6.5) = (20.5)/(0.5) =41. So yes, the intermediate 6.5 cancels, leaving 20.5/0.5=41. Similarly, for n=1, it's just 6.5/0.5=13.

Wait, so in general, for any n, the product from k=1 to n of [ (4k² +2k +0.5)/(4k² -6k +2.5) ] would telescope such that all intermediate terms cancel, leaving the numerator of the last term divided by the denominator of the first term. Let's check for n=3.

For n=3, the product would be:

(6.5/0.5) * (20.5/6.5) * (42.5/20.5) =41 * (42.5/0.5) =41*85=344.5? Wait, but 42.5/0.5=85, so 13*85=1105. Wait, but let's compute step by step:

For k=3:

Numerator:4*(3)^2 +2*3 +0.5=36 +6 +0.5=42.5

Denominator:4*(3)^2 -6*3 +2.5=36 -18 +2.5=20.5

So the product is (6.5/0.5)*(20.5/6.5)*(42.5/20.5)= (6.5/0.5)*(20.5/6.5)*(42.5/20.5)= (41) * (42.5/20.5) =41*2=82. Wait, 42.5/20.5=2.063... Wait, 20.5*2=41, so 42.5/20.5=2.063? Wait, 20.5*2=41, 20.5*2.063≈42.5. So 42.5/20.5=2.063. But 42.5 divided by 20.5 is 2.063. So 41*2.063≈85.5. Wait, but 42.5/0.5=85. So 42.5/0.5=85. Therefore, the product is (6.5/0.5)*(20.5/6.5)*(42.5/20.5)= (6.5/0.5)*(42.5/0.5)= (6.5*42.5)/(0.5*0.5)= (273.75)/0.25=1095. Hmm, but 6.5*42.5=273.75, divided by 0.25 gives 1095. But according to the earlier pattern, for n=3, the result should be (2^(2*3+1) + something)/something. Wait, but 1095 is 21*52.19... Hmm, not sure. Wait, 1095 is 21*52.19? Wait, 21*52=1092, 21*52.19≈1095. So not an integer. But according to the telescoping, the product should be (42.5/0.5)=85, but how?

Wait, the product is (6.5/0.5)*(20.5/6.5)*(42.5/20.5). The 6.5 in the numerator cancels with the 6.5 in the denominator, the 20.5 cancels with the 20.5, leaving 42.5/0.5=85. So indeed, the product for n=3 is 85. So 85 is 5*17. But 85= (2^(2*3 +1) +1)/something? 2^7=128, 128 +1=129. 85 is not 129. Hmm. Wait, but 85= (2^6 +1)/something? 64 +1=65. No. Hmm.

But according to the telescoping, for general n, the product from k=1 to n of [ (4k² +2k +0.5)/(4k² -6k +2.5) ] equals (4n² +2n +0.5)/0.5. Wait, because all the intermediate terms cancel. For example, n=1: (6.5)/0.5=13. n=2: (20.5)/0.5=41. n=3: (42.5)/0.5=85. So the pattern is that for each n, the product is (4n² +2n +0.5)/0.5. Let's check:

For n=1:4(1)^2 +2(1) +0.5=4+2+0.5=6.5. 6.5/0.5=13. Correct.

For n=2:4(4) +4 +0.5=16+4+0.5=20.5. 20.5/0.5=41. Correct.

For n=3:4(9)+6+0.5=36+6+0.5=42.5. 42.5/0.5=85. Correct.

Therefore, the general formula for the product from k=1 to n is (4n² +2n +0.5)/0.5. Simplify that:

(4n² +2n +0.5)/0.5 = (4n²)/0.5 + (2n)/0.5 +0.5/0.5=8n² +4n +1.

Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to8n² +4n +1. Let's verify with n=1:8(1)^2 +4(1)+1=8+4+1=13. Correct. For n=2:8(4)+8+1=32+8+1=41. Correct. For n=3:8(9)+12+1=72+12+1=85. Correct. Therefore, the simplified expression is8n² +4n +1.

But wait, the problem states "Simplify the expression". So the simplified form is8n² +4n +1. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{8n^2 + 4n + 1}.
