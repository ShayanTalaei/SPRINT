<Question>
I have a deck of $54$ cards, and I deal all of the cards to $x$ players, with each player getting $y$ cards. If $x$ is at least $2$ and $y$ is at least $5$, then how many possible values of $x$ are there?

<Plan_1>
Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, I have a deck of 54 cards, and I need to deal all of them to x players, each getting y cards. The conditions are that x is at least 2 and y is at least 5. The question is asking how many possible values of x there are.

Hmm, alright, let's break this down step by step.

<prompt_1.1> Break down the problem into its mathematical components. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
First, the total number of cards is 54, right? So, if I deal them to x players, each getting y cards, that means x multiplied by y equals 54. So, mathematically, that's x * y = 54. Got that. Now, x has to be at least 2, so x ≥ 2. And y has to be at least 5, so y ≥ 5. The problem is asking for the number of possible integer values of x that satisfy these conditions.

So, essentially, we need to find all pairs of integers (x, y) such that x * y = 54, x ≥ 2, and y ≥ 5. Then, count how many distinct x values there are.

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
First, let's list all the positive integer factors of 54 because x and y must be integers.
The factors of 54 are: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54. So, these are the possible values for x and y.

But since x has to be at least 2, we can exclude 1.
So possible x values from the factors are 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54.

But we also need to make sure that y is at least 5. Since y = 54 / x, we need to check for each x if 54 divided by x is at least 5.

<prompt_2.1> Check each possible x value to ensure y is at least 5. </prompt_2.1>
-----

But let me think again if there's another way to approach this.

Alternatively, since x and y are integers, and x ≥2, y ≥5, and x*y=54, we can rephrase the problem as finding the number of divisors of 54 that are greater than or equal to 2 and for which the corresponding co-divisor (54/x) is greater than or equal to 5.

But let me check with specific examples.

<prompt_2.3> Verify the solution with specific examples. </prompt_2.3>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Let's go through them one by one.

Starting with x = 2. Then y = 54 / 2 = 27. 27 is greater than 5, so that's okay. So x=2 is valid.

Next, x = 3. Then y = 54 / 3 = 18. 18 is also greater than 5. So x=3 is valid.

Then x = 6. y = 54 / 6 = 9. 9 is still greater than 5. So x=6 is okay.

Next, x = 9. y = 54 / 9 = 6. 6 is also ≥5, so x=9 is valid.

Then x = 18. y = 54 / 18 = 3. Wait, 3 is less than 5. So this doesn't satisfy the condition. So x=18 is invalid.

Next, x = 27. y = 54 / 27 = 2. 2 is less than 5. So invalid.

x = 54. y = 54 / 54 = 1. Also less than 5. Invalid.

So, the valid x values are 2, 3, 6, 9. That's four values.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
So, each divisor x of 54 (x ≥2) such that 54/x ≥5. So, let's write down the divisors of 54 again: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54. Excluding 1, we have 2,3,6,9,18,27,54. Now, for each of these x, check if 54/x ≥5.

For x=2: 54/2=27 ≥5: yes.

x=3: 54/3=18 ≥5: yes.

x=6: 54/6=9 ≥5: yes.

x=9: 54/9=6 ≥5: yes.

x=18: 54/18=3 <5: no.

x=27:54/27=2 <5: no.

x=54:54/54=1 <5: no.

So, same result: x=2,3,6,9. So 4 values.
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
If x=2, y=27. That's valid. If x=3, y=18. Valid. x=6, y=9. Valid. x=9, y=6. Wait, y=6 here. But the problem says y is at least 5. So 6 is okay. Similarly, x=18, y=3. But y=3 is less than 5. So that's invalid. So x=18 is excluded. Same with x=27, y=2. Also invalid. x=54, y=1. Also invalid. So only x=2,3,6,9. So four values.
</execution_2.3>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Wait, is that all? Let me double-check.
Are there any other factors of 54 that I might have missed?

Wait a second, maybe I need to consider that x and y don't have to be integers? Wait, but the problem says dealing all of the cards to x players, each getting y cards.
If you deal 54 cards to x players, each getting y cards, then x and y must be integers, right? Because you can't deal a fraction of a card. So, yes, x and y must be positive integers.

Therefore, only the integer factors. So, the possible x values are indeed the factors of 54 that are at least 2, and such that 54/x is at least 5. Which gives us 2,3,6,9. So four values.

But let me confirm once more. Let's list all possible pairs (x, y):

<prompt_3.1> List all possible pairs (x, y) and confirm the solution. </prompt_3.1>
-----

But hold on, is there a case where x is not a factor of 54, but 54 divided by x is an integer? Wait, no. Because if x is not a factor of 54, then 54 divided by x would not be an integer, which would mean y is not an integer.

<prompt_3.2> Confirm that x must be a factor of 54 and list constraints. </prompt_3.2>

Alternatively, let's think of it as x must be a divisor of 54, and y must also be a divisor of 54, since y=54/x. So, both x and y must be divisors of 54. So, the pairs of divisors (x, y) where x ≥2 and y ≥5.

<prompt_3.3> Use divisors to find pairs (x, y) and confirm the solution. </prompt_3.3>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
(2,27), (3,18), (6,9), (9,6), (18,3), (27,2), (54,1). So, these are all the possible pairs. Then, from these pairs, we select those where x ≥2 and y ≥5. So, looking at the pairs:

(2,27): x=2 (≥2), y=27 (≥5) → valid.

(3,18): x=3, y=18 → valid.

(6,9): x=6, y=9 → valid.

(9,6): x=9, y=6 → valid.

(18,3): x=18, y=3 → invalid.

(27,2): x=27, y=2 → invalid.

(54,1): x=54, y=1 → invalid.

So, indeed, only four valid pairs. Therefore, four values of x.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
But since the problem states that all cards are dealt, x must divide 54 exactly. So x has to be a divisor of 54.

Therefore, the initial approach is correct. So, x must be a factor of 54, at least 2, and such that y=54/x is at least 5. So, x can be 2,3,6,9. Hence, 4 possible values.
</execution_3.2>

<execution_3.3>
So, the divisors of 54 are [1,2,3,6,9,18,27,54]. So, x can be any divisor except 1, and y=54/x must be at least 5. So, for each x in [2,3,6,9,18,27,54], compute y=54/x and check if y ≥5. As before, x=2 gives y=27, x=3 gives y=18, x=6 gives y=9, x=9 gives y=6. Then x=18 gives y=3, which is less than 5, so excluded. Similarly, x=27 gives y=2, x=54 gives y=1. So, same result. So, 4 possible x's. So, the answer is 4. Therefore, there are 4 possible values of x.

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
But hold on, the problem says "how many possible values of x are there"?
So, the answer is 4. But let me check if there's another way to interpret the problem.

<prompt_4.1> Re-evaluate the problem statement and confirm the solution. </prompt_4.1>

Based on execution_3.3:
But let me just make sure that I haven't missed any divisors. Let's list all divisors of 54 again:

<prompt_4.2> Confirm no divisors are missed and finalize the solution. </prompt_4.2>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
Wait, the problem says "at least 2" for x and "at least 5" for y. So, x can be 2 or more, and y can be 5 or more. So, in the pairs above, we have to ensure that x is at least 2 (which all of them are) and y is at least 5. So, looking at the y values: 27,18,9,6,3,2,1. So, y must be ≥5, so 3,2,1 are too low. Therefore, the pairs where y is 27,18,9,6. So, that's four pairs. Therefore, x can be 2,3,6,9. So, four values.

But let me check if there's a case where x is not a divisor of 54 but y is still an integer. Wait, but if x is not a divisor of 54, then y would be 54 divided by x, which would not be an integer. But since each player must get exactly y cards, y has to be an integer. So, x must divide 54. Therefore, only the divisors of 54 are possible for x. So, the answer is indeed 4. Hmm. So, I think that's correct.
</execution_4.1>

<execution_4.2>
1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54. That's all of them. So, no, there are no other divisors. So, x can only be those. So, 4 values.

Therefore, the answer should be 4. So, the number of possible values of x is 4.
</execution_4.2>
</Execution_4>

<Final_answer>
Therefore, there are $\boxed{4}$ possible values of $x$ that satisfy the given conditions.
