For $0 \le x \le 40$ and $0 \le y \le 50,$ find the minimum value of
\[\sqrt{x^2 + 400} + \sqrt{y^2 + 900} + \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 - 80x - 100y + 4100}.\]
</Question>

<think>
<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to find the minimum value of this expression: √(x² + 400) + √(y² + 900) + √(x² + y² - 80x - 100y + 4100) where x is between 0 and 40, and y is between 0 and 50. Hmm, this looks like a sum of three square roots, each involving x and y in different ways. Maybe this is a problem about distances? Because square roots of sums of squares often represent distances in geometry.

Let me try to interpret each term as a distance.

The first term is √(x² + 400).
That can be written as √(x² + 20²). So that's the distance from the origin (0,0) to the point (x, 20) in a plane.

The second term is √(y² + 900), which is √(y² + 30²).

<prompt_1.1> Interpret the second term √(y² + 900) as a distance and compare it to the first term. </prompt_1.1>

The third term is √(x² + y² - 80x - 100y + 4100). Let me try to complete the squares here to see if that's another distance.

Let's rewrite the expression under the square root:

<prompt_1.2> Interpret the third term √(x² + y² - 80x - 100y + 4100) as a distance by completing the square. </prompt_1.2>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
So, that's the distance from (0,0) to (y, 30). Hmm, but the variables here are x and y, but each term uses only one of them. Maybe there's a coordinate system where these terms represent distances from different points?
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
x² - 80x + y² - 100y + 4100.

Completing the square for x: x² -80x = (x - 40)² - 1600.

For y: y² -100y = (y - 50)² - 2500.

So substituting back:

(x - 40)² - 1600 + (y - 50)² - 2500 + 4100

= (x - 40)² + (y - 50)² - 1600 -2500 +4100

= (x - 40)² + (y - 50)² + ( -4100 +4100 )

= (x - 40)² + (y - 50)².

So the third term is √[(x - 40)² + (y - 50)²], which is the distance from the point (x, y) to the point (40, 50).

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1, execution_1.2:
So putting this all together, the expression is the sum of three distances:

<prompt_2.1> Summarize the expression as the sum of three distances and identify the points involved. </prompt_2.1>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
1. From (0,0) to (x, 20),
2. From (0,0) to (y, 30),
3. From (x, y) to (40, 50).

Wait, that doesn't seem to fit. Let me check again. The first term is √(x² + 20²), which is distance from (0,0) to (x, 20). The second term is √(y² + 30²), which would be the distance from (0,0) to (y, 30). The third term is distance from (x, y) to (40,50). Hmm, but the variables x and y are used in the first two terms as coordinates for different points. This is a bit confusing because x and y are being used both as variables in the expressions and as coordinates in the plane.

Wait, maybe there's a different way to interpret this. Let me think. Maybe all these terms can be represented as distances in a coordinate system where the points are fixed, and x and y are variables? Alternatively, perhaps this is a problem involving reflections or something geometric where we can find a path that minimizes the total distance.

Let me try to visualize this.

Suppose we have three points: A(0, 20), B(0, 30), and C(40, 50).

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
Then, the expression √(x² + 400) + √(y² + 900) + √[(x - 40)² + (y - 50)²] can be interpreted as the sum of distances from a moving point (x, y) to points A, B, and C. Wait, but the first two terms are distances from (0,0) to (x,20) and (0,0) to (y,30), not from (x,y) to A and B. Hmm, maybe I need to adjust my interpretation.

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
Alternatively, perhaps the entire expression can be thought of as a path from a point, moving to (x,20), then to (y,30), then to (40,50). But the variables x and y are in different places, so maybe that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps there's a typo in my interpretation. Let me check again.

The first term is √(x² + 400) = √(x² + 20²), which is the distance from (0,0) to (x,20). The second term is √(y² + 900) = √(y² + 30²), which is the distance from (0,0) to (y,30). The third term is the distance from (x,y) to (40,50). So the entire expression is the sum of three distances: from (0,0) to (x,20), from (0,0) to (y,30), and from (x,y) to (40,50). But x and y are variables here, so maybe this is a problem in higher dimensions? Or perhaps there's a way to parametrize this.

Alternatively, maybe x and y are coordinates in the same plane, but then the first two terms would both be distances from (0,0) to (x,20) and (0,0) to (y,30), which seems redundant. Maybe the problem is in three dimensions? Wait, no, the variables are x and y, so it's a 2D problem. Wait, perhaps the first two terms are distances from two different points to (x,y)? Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps the first term is √(x² + 20²), which could be the distance from (0,0) to (x,20). The second term is √(y² + 30²), which is the distance from (0,0) to (y,30). The third term is the distance from (x,y) to (40,50). So the total expression is the sum of three distances: from (0,0) to (x,20), from (0,0) to (y,30), and from (x,y) to (40,50). But this seems like three separate distances, which might not have a straightforward geometric interpretation. Maybe this is a problem where we need to minimize the sum of these three distances with respect to x and y, where x is between 0 and 40, and y is between 0 and 50.

Based on execution_4.1:
Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to represent this as a path that goes from (0,0) to (x,20) to (x,y) to (40,50), but that would involve moving from (0,0) to (x,20), then to (x,y), then to (40,50). But the second term is √(y² + 900), which would be the distance from (0,0) to (y,30), but if we're moving along a path, that might not correspond.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to minimize the sum of three terms: the distance from (0,0) to (x,20), the distance from (0,0) to (y,30), and the distance from (x,y) to (40,50). But in that case, x and y are variables that we can choose within their respective ranges to minimize the total sum. But that seems a bit abstract. Maybe there's a geometric way to visualize this.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a path that starts at (0,0), goes to (x,20), then goes to (y,30), then goes to (40,50). But the sum would be the total length of that path. But the variables x and y are in different places, so maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the three terms represent three separate legs of a journey, but I need to think more carefully.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to minimize the sum of three distances: from (0,0) to (x,20), from (0,0) to (y,30), and from (x,y) to (40,50). But x is between 0 and 40, and y is between 0 and 50. So x can be up to 40, y up to 50. But how do these relate? Maybe there's a way to represent this as a problem where we have to choose points (x,20) and (y,30) such that the sum of distances from (0,0) to these points, plus the distance from (x,y) to (40,50), is minimized. But this seems a bit abstract. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to choose x and y such that the sum of these three terms is minimized. Let me try to approach this algebraically first.

Alternatively, perhaps using calculus to find the minimum. Since the expression is a sum of square roots, taking partial derivatives with respect to x and y, setting them to zero, and solving for x and y. But since x and y are constrained between 0 and 40, and 0 and 50 respectively, we might need to check both critical points and the boundaries.

Based on execution_5.1:
But before jumping into calculus, maybe there's a geometric insight here. Let me think again.

<prompt_6.1> Consider using calculus to find the minimum of the expression. </prompt_6.1>

<execution_6.1>
The third term is the distance from (x,y) to (40,50). So maybe the problem is to find a point (x,y) such that the sum of the distance from (0,0) to (x,20) (first term), the distance from (0,0) to (y,30) (second term), and the distance from (x,y) to (40,50) (third term) is minimized. But this seems a bit non-standard. Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to interpret this as a path that goes from (0,0) to (x,20) to (x,y) to (40,50), but the second term is the distance from (0,0) to (y,30), which is a different point. This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I need to sketch this out.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the first two terms are fixed once x and y are chosen. Wait, but in the first term, x is the variable, and in the second term, y is the variable. So for a given x and y, the first term is √(x² + 400), which depends on x, the second term is √(y² + 900), which depends on y, and the third term is √((x -40)² + (y -50)²). So the total expression is a function of two variables, x and y, and we need to find its minimum over the rectangle 0 ≤ x ≤40, 0 ≤ y ≤50.

So perhaps using calculus is the way to go here. Let's denote the function as:

f(x, y) = √(x² + 400) + √(y² + 900) + √((x -40)² + (y -50)²)

We need to find the minimum of f(x, y) for x in [0,40] and y in [0,50].

To find the critical points, we can compute the partial derivatives of f with respect to x and y, set them to zero, and solve for x and y. Then check if the solution lies within the domain; if not, the minimum must be on the boundary.

So let's compute ∂f/∂x and ∂f/∂y.

First, ∂f/∂x:

The derivative of √(x² + 400) with respect to x is (x)/√(x² + 400).

The derivative of √((x -40)² + (y -50)²) with respect to x is (x -40)/√((x -40)² + (y -50)²).

The term √(y² + 900) does not depend on x, so its derivative is 0.

Thus,

∂f/∂x = (x)/√(x² + 400) + (x -40)/√((x -40)² + (y -50)²)

Similarly, ∂f/∂y:

The derivative of √(y² + 900) with respect to y is (y)/√(y² + 900).

The derivative of √((x -40)² + (y -50)²) with respect to y is (y -50)/√((x -40)² + (y -50)²).

The term √(x² + 400) does not depend on y, so its derivative is 0.

Thus,

∂f/∂y = (y)/√(y² + 900) + (y -50)/√((x -40)² + (y -50)²)

To find the critical points, set ∂f/∂x = 0 and ∂f/∂y = 0.

So we have the system of equations:

1. (x)/√(x² + 400) + (x -40)/√((x -40)² + (y -50)²) = 0

2. (y)/√(y² + 900) + (y -50)/√((x -40)² + (y -50)²) = 0

This seems quite complicated to solve analytically. Maybe there's a symmetry or substitution that can help here.

<Plan_7>
Based on execution_6.1:
Alternatively, perhaps we can consider that the terms can be interpreted as vectors, and the sum of the vectors is minimized when they are in equilibrium, but this is getting into physics, which might not be straightforward.

<prompt_7.1> Explore alternative methods such as reflection or vector interpretation to solve the problem. </prompt_7.1>
</Plan_7>

<Execution_7>
<execution_7.1>
Alternatively, maybe we can use the method of reflection to turn this into a straight line problem. For example, in problems involving minimizing the sum of distances, reflecting points across axes can help find the shortest path that corresponds to the minimal sum.

Let me think. Suppose we have to go from a point A, reflect off a wall, then go to point B. The shortest path is found by reflecting B across the wall and drawing a straight line from A to the reflection. Maybe a similar idea applies here, but with multiple reflections or terms.

Looking at the expression, we have three terms. The first two are distances from (0,0) to (x,20) and (0,0) to (y,30), and the third is the distance from (x,y) to (40,50). Alternatively, maybe we can represent this as a path from (0,0) to (x,20) to (x,y) to (40,50), but the second term is the distance from (0,0) to (y,30). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the problem as a path that starts at (0,0), goes to (x,20), then goes to (y,30), then goes to (40,50). But the sum would be the total length of that path. But the variables x and y would then be coordinates along the way. However, the problem is stated as the sum of three separate distances: √(x² + 400), √(y² + 900), and √[(x -40)² + (y -50)²]. So each term is a separate distance, not necessarily along a path.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider that the first two terms are fixed once x and y are chosen, but since they are separate, maybe the problem is to choose x and y such that the sum of these three distances is minimized. But how?

Alternatively, maybe we can use the Minkowski inequality, which states that the sum of Euclidean norms is minimized when the vectors are aligned in a certain way. But I'm not sure how to apply that here.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider that the problem is similar to finding a point (x,y) such that the sum of distances from (x,y) to three fixed points is minimized. But in this case, the fixed points would be (0,0) with some scaling? Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the first term is √(x² + 400) = √(x² + 20²), which is the distance from (0,0) to (x,20). The second term is √(y² + 30²), which is the distance from (0,0) to (y,30). The third term is the distance from (x,y) to (40,50). So the total expression is the sum of three distances: from (0,0) to (x,20), from (0,0) to (y,30), and from (x,y) to (40,50). But x and y are variables here, so perhaps we can think of (x,20) and (y,30) as points that depend on x and y, but this seems a bit tangled.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to represent this as a problem involving four points. Let me try to think differently. Suppose we fix x and y, then the first term is the distance from (0,0) to (x,20), the second term is the distance from (0,0) to (y,30), and the third term is the distance from (x,y) to (40,50). So the total is the sum of these three. To minimize this, perhaps we can consider reflecting points to turn this into a straight line problem.

Alternatively, maybe the problem can be transformed into a geometric one where we reflect certain points to make the path straight. For example, in problems where you have to minimize the sum of distances via reflections. Let me try to visualize.

Suppose we have to go from (0,0) to (x,20) to (x,y) to (40,50), but the sum includes the distances from (0,0) to (x,20), from (0,0) to (y,30), and from (x,y) to (40,50). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to choose points (x,20) and (y,30) such that the sum of the distances from (0,0) to these points and from (x,y) to (40,50) is minimized. But this seems like three separate points, which might not have a straightforward solution.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to parametrize x and y such that the derivatives can be set to zero. Let's try to proceed with the calculus approach.

So we have the two equations:

1. x / √(x² + 400) + (x - 40)/√((x - 40)² + (y - 50)²) = 0

2. y / √(y² + 900) + (y - 50)/√((x - 40)² + (y - 50)²) = 0

Let me denote the third term as D = √((x - 40)² + (y - 50)²). Then the equations become:

x / √(x² + 400) + (x - 40)/D = 0

y / √(y² + 900) + (y - 50)/D = 0

Let me rearrange the first equation:

x / √(x² + 400) = -(x - 40)/D

Similarly, the second equation:

y / √(y² + 900) = -(y - 50)/D

Since square roots are positive, the denominators are positive. Therefore, the signs of the numerators must be considered.

Looking at the first equation:

x / √(x² + 400) = -(x - 40)/D

The left side is x divided by a positive number, so its sign is determined by x. The right side is -(x - 40) divided by D, which is positive, so the sign is determined by -(x - 40) = (40 - x). Therefore, the equation implies that x and (40 - x) have the same sign.

Similarly, for the second equation:

y / √(y² + 900) = -(y - 50)/D

The left side's sign is determined by y, and the right side's sign is determined by -(y - 50) = (50 - y). Therefore, y and (50 - y) must have the same sign.

Therefore, in the first equation, x and (40 - x) must have the same sign. Since x is between 0 and 40, (40 - x) is positive when x < 40, zero when x = 40, and positive when x < 40. Wait, but x can be up to 40. So if x is in [0,40], then (40 - x) is in [0,40]. Therefore, (40 - x) is non-negative. Therefore, the right side (40 - x)/D is non-negative, so the left side x / √(x² + 400) must also be non-negative. Therefore, x must be ≥ 0. Which it is, since x is in [0,40]. So that's consistent.

Similarly, in the second equation, y is in [0,50], so (50 - y) is in [0,50], non-negative. Therefore, the right side (50 - y)/D is non-negative, so the left side y / √(y² + 900) must also be non-negative, which it is since y ≥ 0.

Therefore, both equations can be written as:

x / √(x² + 400) = (40 - x)/D

and

y / √(y² + 900) = (50 - y)/D

Let me square both sides of each equation to eliminate the square roots. Starting with the first equation:

(x / √(x² + 400))² = ((40 - x)/D)²

Which gives:

x² / (x² + 400) = (40 - x)² / D²

But D² = (x - 40)² + (y - 50)², so substituting:

x² / (x² + 400) = (40 - x)² / [(x - 40)² + (y - 50)²]

Similarly, for the second equation:

y² / (y² + 900) = (50 - y)² / [(x - 40)² + (y - 50)²]

Let me denote S = [(x - 40)² + (y - 50)²]. Then the equations become:

x² / (x² + 400) = (40 - x)² / S

and

y² / (y² + 900) = (50 - y)² / S

Let me solve each equation for S.

From the first equation:

S = [(40 - x)² / x²] * (x² + 400)

Similarly, from the second equation:

S = [(50 - y)² / y²] * (y² + 900)

Since both expressions equal S, we can set them equal to each other:

[(40 - x)² / x²] * (x² + 400) = [(50 - y)² / y²] * (y² + 900)

This seems complicated, but maybe we can find a relationship between x and y. Let's denote u = 40 - x and v = 50 - y. Then x = 40 - u and y = 50 - v. But substituting this into the equation might not help immediately. Alternatively, perhaps we can assume that the ratios are equal.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a proportion between x and y. Let me consider that the ratios (40 - x)/x and (50 - y)/y are proportional to the square roots of the terms in the numerators.

Wait, from the first equation:

x² / (x² + 400) = (40 - x)² / S

But S is [(x - 40)² + (y - 50)²] = u² + v², where u = x - 40 and v = y - 50. So S = u² + v².

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider that the equations can be rearranged to express S in terms of x and y, and then set them equal.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider that the ratio of the first equation is x / √(x² + 400) = (40 - x)/√S, and similarly for y. Let me denote this ratio as k for the x-component and m for the y-component. Then:

x / √(x² + 400) = (40 - x)/√S => k = (40 - x)/√S

Similarly,

y / √(y² + 900) = (50 - y)/√S => m = (50 - y)/√S

But since both k and m are equal to 1/√S times (40 - x) and (50 - y) respectively, perhaps there's a relationship between x and y.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider that the ratios (40 - x)/x and (50 - y)/y are related through the equations. Let me try to express (40 - x)/x from the first equation.

From the first equation:

x / √(x² + 400) = (40 - x)/√S

Square both sides:

x² / (x² + 400) = (40 - x)² / S

Cross-multiplying:

x² * S = (x² + 400)(40 - x)²

Similarly, from the second equation:

y² / (y² + 900) = (50 - y)² / S

Cross-multiplying:

y² * S = (y² + 900)(50 - y)²

But since both equal S, we can set them equal:

x² * S = (x² + 400)(40 - x)²

y² * S = (y² + 900)(50 - y)²

But since S is the same in both, perhaps we can divide these two equations to eliminate S.

Dividing the first by the second:

(x² * S) / (y² * S) = [(x² + 400)(40 - x)²] / [(y² + 900)(50 - y)²]

Simplifying:

x² / y² = [(x² + 400)(40 - x)²] / [(y² + 900)(50 - y)²]

This is still quite complicated. Maybe there's a symmetry or substitution that can simplify this.

Alternatively, perhaps we can assume that x and y are proportional to 40 and 50, respectively. Let's see. Suppose x = 40k and y = 50k for some k between 0 and 1. Let's test this assumption.

Based on execution_7.1:
Then, substituting into the equation:

( (40k)^2 / ( (40k)^2 + 400 ) ) = ( (40 - 40k)^2 ) / S

Simplify numerator:

(1600k²) / (1600k² + 400) = (1600(1 - k)^2) / S

Simplify left side:

1600k² / (1600k² + 400) = (1600k²) / [400(4k² + 1)] ) = (4k²) / (4k² + 1)

Similarly, right side:

(1600(1 - k)^2) / S => S = 1600(1 - k)^2 / [4k² / (4k² + 1)] ) = 1600(1 - k)^2 * (4k² + 1) / (4k²)

But S is also [(x - 40)^2 + (y - 50)^2] = (40k - 40)^2 + (50k - 50)^2 = [40(k - 1)]^2 + [50(k - 1)]^2 = 1600(k - 1)^2 + 2500(k - 1)^2 = (1600 + 2500)(k - 1)^2 = 4100(k - 1)^2

But (k - 1)^2 = (1 - k)^2, so S = 4100(1 - k)^2

Therefore, equating the two expressions for S:

4100(1 - k)^2 = 1600(1 - k)^2 * (4k² + 1) / (4k²)

Divide both sides by (1 - k)^2 (assuming k ≠ 1, which it isn't since x <40 and y <50):

4100 = 1600 * (4k² + 1) / (4k²)

Multiply both sides by 4k²:

4100 * 4k² = 1600(4k² + 1)

16400k² = 6400k² + 1600

16400k² - 6400k² = 1600

10000k² = 1600

k² = 1600 / 10000 = 0.16

k = √0.16 = 0.4

Therefore, k = 0.4. So x = 40 * 0.4 = 16, y = 50 * 0.4 = 20.

Therefore, x = 16, y = 20. Let's check if this satisfies the original equations.

S = (16 - 40)^2 + (20 - 50)^2 = (-24)^2 + (-30)^2 = 576 + 900 = 1476

Now, check the first equation:

x / √(x² + 400) = 16 / √(256 + 400) = 16 / √656 ≈ 16 / 25.611 ≈ 0.624

(40 - x)/√S = (24)/√1476 ≈ 24 / 38.42 ≈ 0.624

So they are equal. Similarly, check the second equation:

y / √(y² + 900) = 20 / √(400 + 900) = 20 / √1300 ≈ 20 / 36.055 ≈ 0.554

(50 - y)/√S = 30 / √1476 ≈ 30 / 38.42 ≈ 0.779

Wait, 0.554 ≈ 0.554 and 0.779 ≈ 0.779. Wait, but 0.554 is not equal to 0.779. Wait, this suggests a problem.

Let me recalculate S when x=16, y=20:

(x - 40) = 16 - 40 = -24, so (x -40)^2 = 576

(y -50) = 20 -50 = -30, so (y -50)^2 = 900

Thus, S = 576 + 900 = 1476. That's correct.

Then, (50 - y) = 30, so (50 - y)/√S = 30 / √1476 ≈ 30 / 38.42 ≈ 0.779

But according to the equation, y / √(y² + 900) should equal (50 - y)/√S. However, y / √(y² + 900) = 20 / √(400 + 900) = 20 / √1300 ≈ 20 / 36.055 ≈ 0.554. Which is not equal to 0.779.

<Plan_10>
Based on execution_9.1:
Therefore, our assumption that x and y are proportional may be incorrect, or perhaps there's a miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the approach. Let me check the calculations again.

We assumed x =40k and y=50k, then substituted into the equations and found k=0.4. But when we plug x=16, y=20 into the original equations, the second equation isn't satisfied. Therefore, our assumption is invalid.

<Plan_11>
Based on execution_10.1:
Hmm, this suggests that the assumption x=40k, y=50k is invalid. Therefore, we need another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a different substitution or method. Let me think again.

<prompt_11.1> Consider alternative methods to solve the problem, such as reflection or geometric interpretation. </prompt_11.1>

Looking back at the original problem, maybe there's a way to interpret the sum of these three distances as a path that can be transformed into a straight line via reflections. For instance, if we can reflect points such that the path becomes a straight line, then the minimal path would be the straight line distance.

Alternatively, perhaps using the method of reflection for multiple segments. Let me think.

Suppose we have to go from a starting point, reflect over some axes, and find a straight line path that corresponds to the sum of the three distances. For example, the first term is the distance from (0,0) to (x,20), the second term is from (0,0) to (y,30), and the third term is from (x,y) to (40,50). Maybe if we can reflect (40,50) over some lines to make the path a straight line.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider that the sum of the three terms can be interpreted as the total distance traveled in a certain path, and by reflecting points, we can make this path straight. Let me try to visualize.

Suppose we start at (0,0), go to (x,20), then go to (x,y), then go to (40,50). But the sum of the distances is √(x² +400) + √(y² +900) + √[(x-40)² + (y-50)²]. Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed by considering that the sum is equivalent to the sum of distances from (0,0) to (x,20), from (0,0) to (y,30), and from (x,y) to (40,50). Maybe this can be represented as a path that goes through (x,20) and (y,30), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or another inequality to find a lower bound and check if it's achievable.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that each term in the sum is a distance, so maybe the minimal sum is the sum of the minimal possible distances, but that might not be feasible due to the variables being interconnected.

Alternatively, perhaps using vector calculus or another method. But given the time I've spent, maybe the minimal value is achieved when x=16, y=20, even though the equations didn't seem to hold, but perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let's recheck the calculations.

Given x=16, y=20:

First, compute S:

S = (16 -40)^2 + (20 -50)^2 = (-24)^2 + (-30)^2 = 576 + 900 = 1476.

Then, compute x / √(x² +400):

x=16, so 16 / √(16² + 20²) = 16 / √(256 + 400) = 16 / √656 = 16 / (4√41) = 4 / √41 ≈ 0.624.

(40 -x)/√S = 24 / √1476 = 24 / (6√41) = 4 / √41 ≈ 0.624. So that checks out.

Similarly, for y:

y=20, so 20 / √(20² + 30²) = 20 / √(400 + 900) = 20 / √1300 = 20 / (10√13) = 2 / √13 ≈ 0.554.

(50 - y)/√S = 30 / √1476 = 30 / (6√41) = 5 / √41 ≈ 0.780. Wait, 2/√13 ≈ 0.554 and 5/√41 ≈ 0.780. These are not equal. Therefore, there's a contradiction. So x=16, y=20 does not satisfy the second equation. Therefore, our assumption was wrong.
