Okay, so I need to find the product CD where C and D are integers that satisfy the equation:

\[ \frac{C}{x-3} + \frac{D}{x+8} = \frac{4x - 23}{x^2 + 5x - 24} \]

for all real x except -8 and 3. Alright, let me start by understanding what this equation is about. It looks like a partial fractions problem. When you have a rational function, you can decompose it into simpler fractions. Here, the right-hand side is a single fraction, and the left-hand side is the sum of two simpler fractions. So, the idea is to express the right-hand side as the sum of two fractions with linear denominators, which are (x - 3) and (x + 8). 

First, I should check if the denominator on the right-hand side factors into (x - 3)(x + 8). Let me multiply those out to confirm.
Multiplying (x - 3)(x + 8) gives x^2 + 8x - 3x - 24 = x^2 + 5x - 24. Yes, that's exactly the denominator on the right. So, the denominator factors correctly.

So, the equation is set up for partial fraction decomposition. The next step is to combine the left-hand side into a single fraction and then equate the numerators. Let's do that.

To add the two fractions on the left, we need a common denominator, which would be (x - 3)(x + 8). So, we can rewrite each fraction with this denominator:

<prompt_1.1> Combine the fractions on the left-hand side into a single fraction and equate it to the right-hand side. </prompt_1.1>

Wait, but let me think again. The problem says "for all real values of x except -8 and 3". So, the equation must hold for all other x, meaning the numerators must be identical as polynomials. Therefore, equating coefficients is valid here.

Alternatively, another method is to clear the denominators by multiplying both sides by (x - 3)(x + 8). Let's try that approach to verify.

<prompt_1.2> Verify the solution using an alternative method by multiplying both sides by (x - 3)(x + 8). </prompt_1.2>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
\[ \frac{C(x + 8) + D(x - 3)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)} = \frac{4x - 23}{(x - 3)(x + 8)} \]

Since the denominators are the same, the numerators must be equal for all x except 3 and -8. Therefore:

C(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = 4x - 23

Now, let's expand the left-hand side:

C*x + 8C + D*x - 3D = (C + D)x + (8C - 3D)

This must equal 4x - 23. So, we can set up a system of equations by equating the coefficients of like terms:

1. Coefficient of x: C + D = 4
2. Constant term: 8C - 3D = -23
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
Multiplying both sides by (x - 3)(x + 8) gives:

C(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = 4x - 23.

Expanding the left side:

Cx + 8C + Dx - 3D = (C + D)x + (8C - 3D).

This must equal 4x - 23. Therefore, we can set up the system of equations:

C + D = 4,

8C - 3D = -23.

So, solving this system. Let's use substitution. From the first equation, C = 4 - D. Substitute into the second equation:

8(4 - D) - 3D = -23,

32 - 8D - 3D = -23,

32 - 11D = -23,

-11D = -23 - 32,

-11D = -55,

D = (-55)/(-11) = 5.

Then, C = 4 - D = 4 - 5 = -1.

Now, we need to solve this system of equations for C and D. Let's write them down again:

Based on execution_1.2:
Alternatively, to ensure thoroughness, let's pick a specific value of x (other than 3 or -8) and verify that the equation holds. Let's choose x = 0.

<prompt_2.2> Verify the solution by choosing specific values of x and checking if the equation holds. </prompt_2.2>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
1. C + D = 4
2. 8C - 3D = -23

We can solve this using substitution or elimination. Let's try elimination. Multiply the first equation by 3 to make the coefficients of D's opposites:

1. 3C + 3D = 12
2. 8C - 3D = -23

Now, add the two equations together to eliminate D:

(3C + 8C) + (3D - 3D) = 12 + (-23)

11C = -11

Therefore, C = -11 / 11 = -1.

Now, substitute C = -1 into the first equation to find D:

-1 + D = 4

So, D = 4 + 1 = 5.

Therefore, C = -1 and D = 5.

<execution_2.2>
Plugging x = 0 into the original equation:

Left-hand side: C/(0 - 3) + D/(0 + 8) = C/(-3) + D/8 = (-1)/(-3) + 5/8 = 1/3 + 5/8 = (8 + 15)/24 = 23/24.

Right-hand side: (4*0 - 23)/(0^2 + 5*0 -24) = (-23)/(-24) = 23/24. It matches.

Let's try another value, say x = 1.

Left-hand side: C/(1 - 3) + D/(1 + 8) = C/(-2) + D/9 = (-1)/(-2) + 5/9 = 1/2 + 5/9 = (9 + 10)/18 = 19/18.

Right-hand side: (4*1 - 23)/(1 + 5 -24) = (4 -23)/(6 -24) = (-19)/(-18) = 19/18. Also matches.

Based on execution_2.1:
Let me check that.
Plugging C = -1 and D = 5 into the equation:

Left-hand side: -1/(x - 3) + 5/(x + 8). Let's combine these:

<prompt_3.1> Re-combine the fractions with C = -1 and D = 5 and simplify to verify the solution. </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
[-(x + 8) + 5(x - 3)] / [(x - 3)(x + 8)]

Expanding the numerator:

- x - 8 + 5x - 15 = ( -x + 5x ) + ( -8 -15 ) = 4x - 23

Which matches the right-hand side.

Based on execution_3.1:
The problem asks for the product CD.
So, C is -1 and D is 5. Multiplying them together: (-1)(5) = -5. So, the product CD is -5.

But just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the algebra, let me go through the steps again.

<prompt_4.1> Re-evaluate the solution to ensure no mistakes were made in the algebra. </prompt_4.1>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
Starting with the original equation, combined the fractions, expanded, equated coefficients. The equations led to C = -1 and D = 5. Plugging back in confirms the solution. Therefore, CD = (-1)(5) = -5.

<Plan_5>
Based on execution_4.1:
Wait, but the problem states "for all real values of x except -8 and 3", so the equality holds for all other x. Therefore, the coefficients must be equal, which is exactly what we did. So, the steps are correct.

Alternatively, another way to solve for C and D is to choose specific values of x that simplify the equation. For example, if we set x = 3, then the term with (x - 3) becomes undefined, but if we take the limit as x approaches 3, we can find C. Similarly, setting x = -8 will allow us to find D.

Let me try this method as a cross-check.

<prompt_5.1> Use the method of setting specific values of x to find C and D and verify the solution. </prompt_5.1>
</Plan_5>

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
Starting with the equation:

C(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = 4x - 23

If we let x = 3, then the term with (x - 3) becomes zero, so:

C(3 + 8) + D(0) = 4(3) - 23

=> 11C = 12 - 23 = -11

=> C = -11 / 11 = -1

Similarly, let x = -8:

C(-8 + 8) + D(-8 - 3) = 4(-8) -23

=> C(0) + D(-11) = -32 -23 = -55

=> -11D = -55 => D = 5

So, same results. Therefore, C = -1 and D = 5. Product CD = (-1)(5) = -5.
