Okay, so I need to figure out the area of the set S, which consists of points (a, b) where the quartic equation x⁴ + a x³ - b x² + a x + 1 = 0 has at least one real root. Hmm, quartic equations can be tricky, but maybe there's a way to simplify or analyze this equation to find conditions on a and b.

<prompt_1.1> Understand the problem and determine the conditions under which the quartic equation has at least one real root. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
First, let me write down the equation again to make sure I have it right:

x⁴ + a x³ - b x² + a x + 1 = 0.

So, the coefficients involve a and b, and we need to find all pairs (a, b) in the unit square [0,1]×[0,1] such that this equation has at least one real solution x. Then, the area of this set S is what we need to determine.

Since the equation is a quartic (degree 4), it's an even-degree polynomial, which generally tends to +∞ as x approaches both ±∞. So, for the polynomial to have at least one real root, it must attain a non-positive value somewhere because it goes to +∞ at both ends. Alternatively, maybe it touches the x-axis (i.e., has a repeated root) at some point. But how can I formalize this?

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the equation or make a substitution to simplify it. Let me check if the equation is palindromic. A palindromic polynomial satisfies a_i = a_{n-i} for all coefficients. Let's see:

The given polynomial is x⁴ + a x³ - b x² + a x + 1.

Comparing coefficients:

- The coefficient of x⁴ is 1, and the constant term is 1.
- The coefficient of x³ is a, and the coefficient of x is a.
- The middle term is -b x².

So, yes, it seems palindromic because the coefficients read the same forwards and backwards (1, a, -b, a, 1). Palindromic polynomials have the property that if x is a root, then 1/x is also a root. That might be useful.

For a palindromic polynomial of even degree 2n, we can make the substitution y = x + 1/x. Let me try that here. Since the polynomial is degree 4, n=2, so maybe y = x + 1/x. Let's see if that works.

Let me divide both sides of the equation by x² to make it symmetric:

x² + a x - b + a/x + 1/x² = 0.

That can be written as:

(x² + 1/x²) + a(x + 1/x) - b = 0.

Now, let y = x + 1/x. Then, x² + 1/x² = y² - 2. So substituting that in:

(y² - 2) + a y - b = 0.

So, the equation becomes:

y² + a y - (b + 2) = 0.

That's a quadratic in y! So, we have y² + a y - (b + 2) = 0. Now, for real roots x, y must be real because y = x + 1/x. But when is y real?

Well, if x is real and non-zero, then y = x + 1/x is real. However, x can be positive or negative. Let's analyze the possible values of y.

</Execution_1>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
If x > 0, then y = x + 1/x ≥ 2, by the AM-GM inequality, since x and 1/x are positive. Similarly, if x < 0, let me set t = -x, so t > 0, and y = -t - 1/t = - (t + 1/t) ≤ -2. So, for real x ≠ 0, y ∈ (-∞, -2] ∪ [2, ∞). However, if x = 0, the original equation becomes 0 + 0 - 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 ≠ 0, so x=0 is not a root. Therefore, all real roots x must satisfy |y| ≥ 2.

Therefore, the original equation has a real root if and only if the quadratic equation in y has at least one real root with |y| ≥ 2.

So, let's first find the conditions on a and b such that the quadratic equation y² + a y - (b + 2) = 0 has at least one real root with |y| ≥ 2.

To do this, let's analyze the quadratic equation.

-----

But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if there's a mistake here.

Wait, but when we make the substitution y = x + 1/x, we assume x ≠ 0. But since x=0 is not a root, that's okay.

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
The quadratic equation in y is:

y² + a y - (b + 2) = 0.

The discriminant D must be non-negative for real roots to exist. So,

D = a² + 4(b + 2) ≥ 0.

But since a and b are non-negative (they lie in [0,1]×[0,1]), D is always positive because 4(b + 2) ≥ 8, and a² ≥ 0, so D ≥ 8 > 0. Therefore, the quadratic in y always has two distinct real roots. So, the discriminant condition is always satisfied, and we don't need to worry about that. The real constraint is that at least one of the roots y satisfies |y| ≥ 2.

Therefore, the problem reduces to finding all (a, b) in [0,1]×[0,1] such that the quadratic equation y² + a y - (b + 2) = 0 has at least one root with |y| ≥ 2.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Also, for each y ≥ 2 or y ≤ -2, there exists real x such that y = x + 1/x. For example, if y ≥ 2, then x can be the positive solution to x + 1/x = y, which is x = [y ± sqrt(y² - 4)]/2. Similarly for y ≤ -2. So, the substitution is valid, and the mapping from x to y is bijective for y ≥ 2 and y ≤ -2.

Therefore, the original equation has a real root if and only if the quadratic in y has a root with |y| ≥ 2. Therefore, the conditions on a and b are that the quadratic equation y² + a y - (b + 2) = 0 has at least one real root with |y| ≥ 2.

So, now we need to translate this into conditions on a and b. Let's consider the quadratic equation:

y² + a y - (b + 2) = 0.

Let's denote this as Q(y) = 0. The roots are:

y = [-a ± sqrt(a² + 4(b + 2))]/2.

Since the discriminant D = a² + 4(b + 2). Since a and b are non-negative (as they are in [0,1]), D is always positive because 4(b + 2) ≥ 8, and a² ≥ 0. Therefore, the quadratic has two distinct real roots. Now, we need at least one of these roots to satisfy |y| ≥ 2.

So, the question reduces to: For which (a, b) in [0,1]×[0,1] does at least one of the roots of Q(y) = 0 satisfy |y| ≥ 2?

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Let me denote the roots as y₁ and y₂. For quadratic equations, the roots can be ordered as y₁ ≤ y₂. Since the coefficient of y² is positive, the parabola opens upwards. Therefore, the roots are such that y₁ ≤ y₂. To have at least one root with |y| ≥ 2, we need either y₂ ≥ 2 or y₁ ≤ -2.

Wait, is that correct?

Wait, if the quadratic opens upwards (since the coefficient of y² is 1, which is positive), then the quadratic tends to +∞ as y → ±∞. The vertex is at y = -a/2. Since a is non-negative, the vertex is at y ≤ 0. So, the minimum of the quadratic is at y = -a/2, which is on the negative y-axis (since a ≥ 0). The quadratic crosses the y-axis at y = - (b + 2), which is negative since b + 2 ≥ 2.

Wait, perhaps drawing a graph would help. Alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that for a quadratic to have a root greater than or equal to 2 or less than or equal to -2, certain conditions on the quadratic must be satisfied.

Alternatively, maybe consider two cases: one where the quadratic has a root y ≥ 2, and another where it has a root y ≤ -2. Then, take the union of these cases.

But perhaps a better approach is to note that if the maximum of the quadratic at its vertex is less than zero, then there are no real roots. But we already know there are two real roots. Wait, but the quadratic opens upwards, so if the minimum at y = -a/2 is below zero, which it is, since substituting y = -a/2 into Q(y):

Q(-a/2) = (-a/2)² + a*(-a/2) - (b + 2) = a²/4 - a²/2 - b - 2 = -a²/4 - b - 2, which is always negative. Therefore, the quadratic crosses the y-axis at y = - (b + 2) (when y=0, Q(0) = - (b + 2) < 0), and tends to +∞ as y → ±∞. Therefore, one root is less than the vertex and one is greater? Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, the quadratic has two real roots. Since the vertex is at y = -a/2, which is to the left of the y-axis (since a ≥ 0). The quadratic is negative at the vertex and tends to +∞ as y approaches both ±∞. Therefore, one root is less than the vertex, and the other is greater? Wait, no. Wait, the parabola opens upwards. If the vertex is at y = -a/2, which is negative, and the quadratic is negative at the vertex, then the two roots must both be on the left and right sides of the vertex? Wait, maybe not. Let's take an example. Suppose a = 0, then the quadratic becomes y² - (b + 2) = 0, so roots at y = ±sqrt(b + 2). Since b ∈ [0,1], sqrt(b + 2) ∈ [sqrt(2), sqrt(3)] ≈ [1.414, 1.732]. But we need |y| ≥ 2, which is not satisfied here. Wait, but if a = 0, then the original equation becomes x⁴ - b x² + 1 = 0. Wait, but substituting y = x + 1/x, when a=0, the quadratic becomes y² - (b + 2) = 0, so y = ±sqrt(b + 2). But sqrt(b + 2) is at least sqrt(2) ≈ 1.414, which is less than 2. Therefore, in this case, there are no real roots x, because y must be ≥ 2 or ≤ -2, but the roots y are only up to sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732. Therefore, when a=0 and b ∈ [0,1], the original equation has no real roots. Therefore, in this case, (a, b) = (0, b) is not in S. So, that aligns with our previous conclusion.

Wait, so when a=0, the equation has no real roots. Therefore, (0, b) ∉ S for any b.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
y₂ = [-a + sqrt(a² + 4(b + 2))]/2.

Since sqrt(a² + 4(b + 2)) > sqrt(4(b + 2)) = 2 sqrt(b + 2) ≥ 2 sqrt(2) ≈ 2.828. Therefore, the term -a - sqrt(...) is negative, and divided by 2, so y₁ is negative. Similarly, y₂ is (-a + something positive)/2. Since sqrt(a² + 4(b + 2)) > a, because 4(b + 2) > 0, so sqrt(a² + 4(b + 2)) > a, so -a + sqrt(...) is positive. Therefore, y₂ is positive.

Therefore, y₁ is negative and y₂ is positive. Therefore, to have |y| ≥ 2, we need either y₂ ≥ 2 or y₁ ≤ -2. But since y₁ is negative, y₁ ≤ -2 is possible, and y₂ ≥ 2 is also possible. So, either y₂ ≥ 2 or y₁ ≤ -2. However, note that since y₁ * y₂ = c/a = - (b + 2)/1 = - (b + 2). So, the product of the roots is - (b + 2), which is negative. Therefore, one root is positive and the other is negative, which matches our previous conclusion. Therefore, the positive root is y₂ and the negative root is y₁.

Therefore, the conditions are:

Either y₂ ≥ 2 or y₁ ≤ -2.

But since y₁ * y₂ = - (b + 2), if y₂ ≥ 2, then y₁ = - (b + 2)/y₂ ≤ - (b + 2)/2. Since b ∈ [0,1], (b + 2)/2 ∈ [1, 1.5], so y₁ ≤ -1.5. Therefore, y₁ ≤ -2 is a stricter condition than y₁ ≤ -1.5. So, if y₂ ≥ 2, then y₁ ≤ - (b + 2)/2. Since b ∈ [0,1], (b + 2)/2 ∈ [1, 1.5], so y₁ ≤ -1.5, which is less than -2? Wait, no. If (b + 2)/2 is at least 1, then - (b + 2)/2 is at least -1.5. So, y₁ ≤ -1.5, which is not ≤ -2. Therefore, y₁ ≤ -2 would require that - (b + 2)/y₂ ≤ -2. Since y₂ is positive, this is equivalent to (b + 2)/y₂ ≥ 2, so (b + 2) ≥ 2 y₂. But since y₂ is a root, we have y₂² + a y₂ - (b + 2) = 0, so (b + 2) = y₂² + a y₂. Therefore, substituting into (b + 2) ≥ 2 y₂ gives y₂² + a y₂ ≥ 2 y₂, which simplifies to y₂² + (a - 2) y₂ ≥ 0.

But since y₂ ≥ 0, and a ∈ [0,1], (a - 2) is negative. So, y₂² + (a - 2) y₂ ≥ 0.

Let me factor this:

y₂ (y₂ + a - 2) ≥ 0.

Since y₂ > 0, the term (y₂ + a - 2) must be ≥ 0 for the product to be non-negative. Therefore:

y₂ + a - 2 ≥ 0 ⇒ y₂ ≥ 2 - a.

But since a ∈ [0,1], 2 - a ∈ [1,2]. So, y₂ ≥ 2 - a. However, we need to see if this is possible.

Alternatively, maybe this approach is getting too convoluted. Let me step back.

We need to find (a, b) such that either y₂ ≥ 2 or y₁ ≤ -2. Let's handle these two cases separately.

Case 1: y₂ ≥ 2.

Case 2: y₁ ≤ -2.

Let's analyze Case 1 first: y₂ ≥ 2.

Since y₂ is the larger root, which is positive. So, we need the larger root to be at least 2.

For a quadratic equation y² + p y + q = 0, the condition that the larger root is at least k is equivalent to substituting y = k and ensuring that the quadratic is ≤ 0 at y = k (since the parabola opens upwards). Wait, no. Wait, since the quadratic is y² + a y - (b + 2). If we want y₂ ≥ 2, then substituting y = 2 into the quadratic should give a value ≤ 0, because at y = 2, the quadratic is below or equal to zero, which would imply that 2 is less than or equal to the larger root. Let me recall the rule: for a quadratic f(y) = y² + a y - (b + 2), which opens upwards, f(2) ≤ 0 implies that 2 is ≤ the larger root. Similarly, f(-2) ≤ 0 implies that -2 is ≥ the smaller root.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to use the quadratic's properties. For the quadratic equation y² + a y - (b + 2) = 0, the roots are y₂ ≥ 0 and y₁ ≤ 0. We need either y₂ ≥ 2 or y₁ ≤ -2.

Let me first find the condition for y₂ ≥ 2.

<prompt_4.1> Derive the conditions for y₂ ≥ 2 and y₁ ≤ -2 using the properties of the quadratic equation. </prompt_4.1>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
For the quadratic equation, since y₂ is the larger root, if we plug y = 2 into the quadratic, since the quadratic opens upwards, if f(2) ≤ 0, then 2 is less than or equal to the larger root. Similarly, if we plug y = -2 into the quadratic, since the quadratic opens upwards, if f(-2) ≤ 0, then -2 is greater than or equal to the smaller root.

Therefore:

Condition 1 (y₂ ≥ 2): f(2) ≤ 0 ⇒ 2² + a*2 - (b + 2) ≤ 0 ⇒ 4 + 2a - b - 2 ≤ 0 ⇒ 2 + 2a - b ≤ 0 ⇒ b ≥ 2 + 2a.

But since b ≤ 1, this would require 2 + 2a ≤ b ≤ 1. However, 2 + 2a ≥ 2, since a ≥ 0, but b ≤ 1, so 2 + 2a ≤ 1 ⇒ 2a ≤ -1 ⇒ a ≤ -0.5, which is impossible because a ≥ 0. Therefore, there is no solution in this case. Therefore, y₂ cannot be ≥ 2. Therefore, the only possibility is y₁ ≤ -2.

Wait, that seems important. Let me check again.

If we set f(2) ≤ 0, we get b ≥ 2 + 2a. But since b ≤ 1, this would require 2 + 2a ≤ 1 ⇒ 2a ≤ -1 ⇒ a ≤ -0.5, which is impossible. Therefore, there is no (a, b) in [0,1]×[0,1] such that y₂ ≥ 2.

Based on execution_4.1:
Therefore, only the other case, y₁ ≤ -2, can occur. Therefore, we need to find the condition that the smaller root y₁ ≤ -2.

Similarly, since the quadratic opens upwards, f(-2) ≤ 0 would imply that -2 is greater than or equal to the smaller root. So, let's check that.

Compute f(-2) = (-2)^2 + a*(-2) - (b + 2) = 4 - 2a - b - 2 = 2 - 2a - b.

So, f(-2) ≤ 0 ⇒ 2 - 2a - b ≤ 0 ⇒ b ≥ 2 - 2a.

Therefore, the condition for y₁ ≤ -2 is b ≥ 2 - 2a.

But since b ∈ [0,1], this inequality becomes 2 - 2a ≤ b ≤ 1. Therefore, for each a, b must be in [max(2 - 2a, 0), 1].

Solving 2 - 2a ≤ 1 ⇒ -2a ≤ -1 ⇒ 2a ≥ 1 ⇒ a ≥ 0.5.

Therefore, for a ≥ 0.5, 2 - 2a ≤ 1, so the condition becomes b ≥ 2 - 2a. For a < 0.5, 2 - 2a > 1, but since b ≤ 1, there are no solutions in that case. Therefore, the region S is defined by a ∈ [0.5, 1] and b ∈ [2 - 2a, 1].
</execution_6.1>

<execution_6.2>
Also, since a ∈ [0,1], let's see the range of 2 - 2a. When a ∈ [0,1], 2 - 2a ∈ [0, 2]. But since b ∈ [0,1], the effective lower bound for b is max(2 - 2a, 0). Therefore, the region in the (a, b) square where b ≥ 2 - 2a and b ≤ 1, with a ∈ [0,1].

But let's visualize this. For a from 0 to 1:

- When a = 0, 2 - 2a = 2, so b ≥ 2. But since b ≤ 1, there's no overlap. So, at a = 0, no points (a, b) satisfy the condition.
- When a increases from 0 to 1, 2 - 2a decreases from 2 to 0. Therefore, there exists a critical value of a where 2 - 2a = 1, which is when a = (2 - 1)/2 = 0.5. So, for a ∈ [0.5, 1], 2 - 2a ≤ 1, so the lower bound for b is 2 - 2a, which is between 0 and 1. For a ∈ [0, 0.5), 2 - 2a > 1, so the lower bound for b is 1 (since b cannot exceed 1). Therefore, the region S is the set of (a, b) where:

- For a ∈ [0.5, 1], b ∈ [2 - 2a, 1].
- For a ∈ [0, 0.5), b ∈ [1, 1], which is just the line segment a ∈ [0, 0.5), b = 1.

Wait, but let me confirm. If a ∈ [0, 0.5), then 2 - 2a ∈ (1, 2]. So, since b ≤ 1, the condition b ≥ 2 - 2a would require b ≥ something greater than 1, which is impossible. Therefore, for a ∈ [0, 0.5), there are no (a, b) with b ∈ [0,1] satisfying b ≥ 2 - 2a. Therefore, for a ∈ [0, 0.5), the set S is empty. For a ∈ [0.5, 1], we have b ∈ [2 - 2a, 1].

Therefore, the region S is the area above the line b = 2 - 2a from a = 0.5 to a = 1, and above b = 1 from a = 0 to a = 0.5. Wait, but actually, for a ∈ [0, 0.5), the condition b ≥ 2 - 2a would require b ≥ something greater than 1, which is impossible, so there's no contribution to S from a ∈ [0, 0.5). For a ∈ [0.5, 1], the condition b ≥ 2 - 2a is feasible since 2 - 2a ≤ 1 when a ≥ 0.5. Therefore, S is the region where a ∈ [0.5, 1] and b ∈ [2 - 2a, 1].

So, the region S is a triangle with vertices at (0.5, 1), (1, 1), and (1, 0). Wait, no. Wait, for each a from 0.5 to 1, b ranges from (2 - 2a) to 1. So, when a = 0.5, b ranges from 1 to 1 (a single point). When a = 1, b ranges from 0 to 1. So, the region is a triangle with vertices at (0.5, 1), (1, 1), and (1, 0). The area of this triangle is 1/2 * base * height. The base along the a-axis is from 0.5 to 1, which is 0.5. The height is from b=0 to b=1, which is 1. But actually, the triangle is right-angled with legs of length 0.5 and 1. Therefore, area is (0.5 * 1 * 0.5) = 0.25. Wait, no. Wait, the area of a triangle is 1/2 * base * height.

Based on execution_8.1:
But let me check if there's any mistake in assuming that the only condition is y₁ ≤ -2. Earlier, we saw that y₂ cannot be ≥ 2 because that would require b ≥ 2 + 2a, which is impossible since b ≤ 1. Therefore, all solutions must come from y₁ ≤ -2, which gives b ≥ 2 - 2a. Therefore, the region S is exactly the area we computed.

But just to be thorough, let's test a point in S and check if the original equation has a real root.

<prompt_9.2> Test specific points in the region S and verify if the original equation has a real root. </prompt_9.2>

Another test case: a = 1, b = 1. Then the equation is x⁴ + x³ - b x² + x + 1 = 0. Wait, substituting a=1, b=1: x⁴ + x³ - x² + x + 1 = 0. Let me check x = -1: (-1)^4 + (-1)^3 - (-1)^2 + (-1) + 1 = 1 -1 -1 -1 +1 = -1 ≠ 0. x = -2: 16 -8 -4 -2 +1 = 3 ≠ 0. Maybe there's a root around x < -2? Let's check x = -3: 81 - 27 -9 -3 +1 = 43 ≠ 0. Hmm, but according to our previous analysis, x = -3 would correspond to y = x + 1/x = -3 + (-1/3) = -3 - 1/3 = -10/3 ≈ -3.333, which is less than -2. But maybe the equation x⁴ + x³ - x² + x + 1 = 0 does have a real root. Let me check the behavior: as x approaches -∞, x⁴ dominates, so it goes to +∞. At x = -1, the value is 1 -1 -1 -1 +1 = -1. At x = -2, 16 -8 -4 -2 +1 = 3. Therefore, by Intermediate Value Theorem, there is a root between x = -2 and x = -1. Therefore, the equation does have a real root, so (1,1) is indeed in S. So, that checks out.

Therefore, the region S is the triangle with vertices at (0.5,1), (1,1), and (1,0), and its area is 1/2 * 0.5 * 1 = 0.25. Therefore, the answer is 1/4.

At a = 0.5: (0.25) - 0.5 = -0.25.

Subtracting: 0 - (-0.25) = 0.25. Yes, so the area is 0.25, which is 1/4.

Let's take a = 0.5, b = 1. Then the original equation is x⁴ + 0.5 x³ - 1 x² + 0.5 x + 1 = 0. Let's check x = -1: 1 -0.5 -1 -0.5 +1 = 0. So, x = -1 is a root. Therefore, (0.5, 1) is on the boundary of S, and the equation has a real root. Another test case: a = 0.75, b = 2 - 2*0.75 = 0.5. Then, the equation is x⁴ +0.75 x³ -0.5 x² +0.75 x +1 =0. Let's check x = -1: 1 -0.75 -0.5 -0.75 +1 = 0. So, x = -1 is again a root. Wait, but according to our earlier analysis, when a = 0.75, b must be ≥ 0.5. So, if we take a = 0.75 and b = 0.5, then substituting x = -1 gives 1 -0.75 -0.5 -0.75 +1 = 0. So, x = -1 is a root. Therefore, the equation has a real root. So, that's correct.

Another test case: a = 0.5, b = 0.5 (but according to our region S, b must be ≥ 1 - 2*0.5 = 0. Wait, no. Wait, when a = 0.5, 2 - 2a = 2 - 1 = 1. So, for a = 0.5, b must be ≥ 1. But since b ≤ 1, the only point is (0.5, 1). So, if we take a = 0.5 and b = 1, we have the equation x⁴ +0.5 x³ -1 x² +0.5 x +1 =0. We saw that x = -1 is a root. Therefore, that's correct.

Therefore, the region S is indeed the triangle with vertices at (0.5,1), (1,1), and (1,0), and the area is 1/4.

Therefore, the answer is \boxed{\dfrac{1}{4}}.
