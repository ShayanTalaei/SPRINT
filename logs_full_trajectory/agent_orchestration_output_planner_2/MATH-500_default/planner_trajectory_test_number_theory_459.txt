<Question>
On a particular map, $3$ inches on the map equates to $10$ miles in real life. If you know that the real life distance between two buildings on the map is $53.25$ miles, what would the distance between the buildings be (in inches) on the map, expressed as a fraction?

Okay, so I need to figure out how many inches on the map correspond to 53.25 miles in real life. The map scale given is 3 inches on the map equaling 10 miles in real life. Let me start by understanding the scale properly. 

First, maybe I should find out how many miles one inch on the map represents.

<prompt_1.1> Calculate the miles per inch based on the given map scale. </prompt_1.1>

<execution_1.1>
If 3 inches = 10 miles, then 1 inch would be 10 miles divided by 3. Let me write that down: 10 miles รท 3 inches = 10/3 miles per inch. Wait, but actually, that's miles per inch. But since we need to convert miles to inches on the map, maybe I need the inverse. Hmm, let me think. If 10 miles correspond to 3 inches, then 1 mile would correspond to 3/10 inches. So, to get the map distance for a real life distance, I should multiply the real distance by 3/10. 

Wait, let me check that again. Let's take the original scale: 3 inches on the map is 10 miles real. So, the conversion factor from real miles to map inches is 3 inches / 10 miles. So, for any real distance, the map distance would be (3/10) * real distance. That makes sense.

Based on execution_1.1:
So, applying that to 53.25 miles.

<prompt_2.1> Use the conversion factor to calculate the map distance for 53.25 miles. </prompt_2.1>

Alternatively, maybe set up a proportion. If 10 miles correspond to 3 inches, then 53.25 miles correspond to x inches. So, the proportion is 10 miles : 3 inches = 53.25 miles : x inches. So, 10/53.25 = 3/x.

<prompt_2.2> Use a proportion to calculate the map distance for 53.25 miles. </prompt_2.2>
-----

Alternatively, maybe using unit conversion. 53.25 miles * (3 inches / 10 miles). The miles unit cancels out, so 53.25 * 3 /10 inches.
Which is the same as before.

Let me compute that. 53.25 miles multiplied by 3 inches per 10 miles. So, mathematically, that's (53.25 * 3)/10. Let me do the multiplication first. 53.25 times 3. Hmm, 50*3=150, 3.25*3=9.75, so total is 150 + 9.75 = 159.75. Then divide by 10, which gives 15.975 inches.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Wait, actually, proportions can be set up as miles to inches. So, 10 miles is to 3 inches as 53.25 miles is to x inches. So, 10/53.25 = 3/x. Wait, but that might be flipped. Let me think. If 10 miles corresponds to 3 inches, then the ratio of miles to inches is 10:3. So, 53.25 miles would correspond to x inches, so 53.25:x should be in the same ratio. So, 10/3 = 53.25/x. Solving for x, x = (53.25 * 3)/10. Let me compute that. 53.25 times 3 is 159.75, divided by 10 is 15.975 inches. Which is the same as before.

Based on execution_2.1:
Wait, but the question says to express it as a fraction. Hmm, 15.975 inches. Let me convert that decimal to a fraction.
The 0.975 part. Since 0.975 is 975/1000. Let me simplify that.

<prompt_3.1> Convert the decimal 0.975 to a fraction and add it to 15 to express the result as an improper fraction. </prompt_3.1>

Wait, but maybe there's a more precise way to do this without converting to decimals initially. Let me try that approach.

<prompt_3.2> Re-evaluate the conversion without converting 53.25 to a decimal. </prompt_3.2>

Let me confirm once more. Let's take the original scale: 3 inches = 10 miles.

<prompt_3.3> Verify the solution using the original scale and different approaches. </prompt_3.3>
-----

Wait, but let me check if 10/3 is indeed the correct conversion factor. If 3 inches = 10 miles, then miles to inches would be inches = (3/10) * miles. So, miles multiplied by 3/10 gives inches. So, yes, 53.25 * 3/10 = 15.975, which is 15 and 39/40 inches.

<execution_3.1>
First, 975 divided by 1000. Both divisible by 25: 975 รท25=39, 1000 รท25=40. So, 39/40. Therefore, 0.975 is 39/40. So, 15.975 inches is 15 + 39/40 inches. To express this as an improper fraction, 15 is 60/4 (since 15*40=600, wait no, denominators are 1 and 40). Wait, to convert 15 to 40ths, multiply numerator and denominator by 40. So, 15 = 15/1 = (15*40)/(1*40) = 600/40. Then add 39/40: 600 + 39 = 639. So, total is 639/40 inches.

<execution_3.2>
The scale is 3 inches for 10 miles. So, the ratio is 3 inches : 10 miles. So, for 53.25 miles, we can set up a proportion. Let me denote the map distance as x inches. So, 3/10 = x/53.25. Solving for x, cross-multiplying gives x = (3 * 53.25)/10. Let's compute 3*53.25 first. 53*3=159, 0.25*3=0.75, so total is 159.75. Then divide by 10 gives 15.975 inches. So, same result as before. So, 15.975 inches.
</execution_3.2>

<execution_3.3>
So, 10 miles is 3 inches. So, 1 mile is 3/10 inches. Therefore, 53.25 miles would be 53.25 * (3/10) inches. Let's compute that as a fraction. 53.25 is a decimal, so let's convert that to a fraction. 53.25 is the same as 53 + 0.25. 0.25 is 1/4, so 53.25 is 53 + 1/4 = (53*4 +1)/4 = (212 +1)/4 = 213/4. So, 53.25 miles is 213/4 miles. 

Now, multiplying that by 3/10 inches per mile: (213/4) * (3/10) = (213*3)/(4*10) = 639/40. Let me check that multiplication: 213*3. 200*3=600, 13*3=39, so 600+39=639. Yes. And 4*10=40. So, 639/40. Let me divide that to check: 40*15=600, 639-600=39, so 15 and 39/40, which is 15.975. So that's correct. 

So, 639/40 is the fractional inches. Let me check if this fraction can be simplified. Let's see. The numerator is 639 and denominator 40. Let's find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 639 and 40. Factors of 40: 2,4,5,8,10,20,40. Check if 2 divides 639: 639 is odd, so no. 4: same. 5: 639 ends with 9, so no. 8: same. 10: same. 20,40: same. So, GCD is 1. Therefore, 639/40 is in simplest terms.

Based on execution_3.1:
Let me check this again. 53.25 miles * 3/10 inches per mile.
Let's compute 53.25 * 3 first. 53 *3=159, 0.25*3=0.75, so total 159.75. Then divide by 10: 15.975. Which is 15 and 39/40. So, as an improper fraction, 15*40 +39=600+39=639, so 639/40.

Based on execution_3.3:
Alternatively, maybe check if I converted 53.25 miles correctly to a fraction. 53.25 miles is 53 miles and 0.25 miles. Since 1 mile is 5280 feet, but maybe not needed here. Alternatively, 0.25 miles is a quarter of a mile. But since we are dealing with inches, perhaps converting 0.25 miles to inches. Wait, but the original scale is 3 inches for 10 miles, so maybe better to stick with the ratio. 

Alternatively, using unit conversion factors. 53.25 miles * (3 inches / 10 miles). The miles unit cancels, so 53.25 *3 /10 inches. Which again is 159.75 /10 =15.975. So, same result.

Based on execution_3.2:
Wait, but 639 divided by 40. Let me confirm that 639/40 is the correct fraction.
Yes, because 53.25 is 213/4, multiplied by 3/10 is 639/40. So, that's correct.
