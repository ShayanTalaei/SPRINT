</Question>

Okay, so I need to find the constant term in the expansion of (10x³ - 1/(2x²))⁵. Hmm, let's see. I remember that when you have a binomial expansion, each term is of the form C(n, k) * (a)^(n-k) * (b)^k. In this case, a is 10x³ and b is -1/(2x²). The exponent n is 5. So each term in the expansion will be C(5, k) * (10x³)^(5 - k) * (-1/(2x²))^k. I need to find the term where the exponent of x is zero because that's the constant term.

First, let me write out the general term. The term is:

<prompt_1.1> Write out the general term of the binomial expansion for the given expression. </prompt_1.1>

Now, I need to find the value of k for which the exponent of x is zero. Let's figure out the exponent of x in each term. 

From (10x³)^(5 - k), the exponent of x is 3*(5 - k). From (-1/(2x²))^k, the exponent of x is -2k. So the total exponent of x in the term is 3*(5 - k) - 2k.
Let me compute that:

3*(5 - k) - 2k = 15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k.

Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, confirming the general term.

<prompt_1.2> Verify the binomial expansion and the general term formula. </prompt_1.2>

Calculating the exponent:

3*(5 - k) from the first part, and -2k from the second part. So total exponent is 15 - 3k -2k =15 -5k. Correct.

Setting that equal to zero gives k=3.

Calculating the term when k=3.

C(5, k) * (10x³)^(5 - k) * (-1/(2x²))^k.

Now, let's simplify this term. 

First, the constants: 10^(5 - k) * (-1)^k / (2^k). Then the x part: x^(3*(5 - k)) * x^(-2k) = x^(15 - 3k - 2k) = x^(15 - 5k). 

So the exponent of x in the term is 15 - 5k. We need this exponent to be zero for the term to be constant. Therefore, 15 - 5k = 0. Solving for k: 5k = 15 => k = 3.

The binomial theorem says (a + b)^n = Σ C(n, k) a^(n - k) b^k. So here, a is 10x³ and b is -1/(2x²). Yes, that seems right. 

Calculating the exponent: 3*(5 - k) comes from the exponent in (10x³)^(5 - k). Since 10x³ raised to any power will contribute 3 times that power to the exponent of x. Similarly, (-1/(2x²))^k will contribute -2k to the exponent of x. So combining those gives 15 - 5k. That seems correct.

Solving 15 - 5k = 0 gives k = 3. Since k must be an integer between 0 and 5, inclusive, k=3 is valid.

C(5,3) * (10x³)^(2) * (-1/(2x²))^3.

C(5,3) is 10. (10x³)^2 is 100x^6. (-1/(2x²))^3 is (-1)^3/(2^3 x^6) = -1/(8x^6). Multiplying all together: 10 * 100x^6 * (-1/(8x^6)) = 10 * 100 * (-1/8) * x^(6-6) = 10 * (-100/8) * x^0 = 10*(-12.5) = -125.

Based on execution_1.1:
Let me verify that.
If k = 3, then the exponent is 15 - 5*3 = 15 - 15 = 0.

Now, let's compute the coefficient for that term.

First, the combination C(5, 3). That's 5! / (3! * (5 - 3)!) ) = (120)/(6 * 2) = 120 / 12 = 10. 

Then, the constants: 10^(5 - 3) = 10² = 100. (-1/2)^3 = (-1)^3 / 2^3 = -1 / 8. So multiplying the constants together: 10 * 100 * (-1/8) = 10 * (100 * -1 / 8) = 10 * (-12.5) = -125.

Based on execution_2.1:
Wait, let me check that again.

<prompt_3.1> Re-calculate the constant term for k=3 to ensure accuracy. </prompt_3.1>

So combining all parts:

C(5, 3) = 10.

(10x³)^(5 - 3) = (10x³)^2 = 100x^6.

(-1/(2x²))^3 = (-1)^3/(2^3 x^6) = -1/(8x^6).

Multiply all constants: 10 * 100 * (-1/8) = 10 * (100 * -1 / 8) = 10 * (-12.5) = -125.

So the constant term is -125?

Based on execution_3.1:
Hmm, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the combination or exponents.

<prompt_4.1> Verify the calculations for the constant term using different values of k. </prompt_4.1>

Let me re-calculate the constants step by step.

First, C(5, 3) is indeed 10. Correct.

Then, (10x³)^(2) is 10² * x^(3*2) = 100x^6. Correct.

Then, (-1/(2x²))^3 is (-1)^3 * (1/(2^3)) * (1/x^(2*3)) = -1 * 1/8 * 1/x^6 = -1/(8x^6). Correct.

Multiplying these together: 100x^6 * (-1/(8x^6)) = (100 * -1 / 8) * (x^6 / x^6) = (-12.5) * 1 = -12.5. Then multiply by the combination 10: 10 * (-12.5) = -125. So yes, that's correct. So the constant term is -125.

Based on execution_4.1:
Wait, but let me confirm once more. Maybe I missed a negative sign or something.

<prompt_5.1> Re-evaluate the calculation of the constant term to confirm the result. </prompt_5.1>

Looking back:

The term is C(5, 3) * (10x³)^(2) * (-1/(2x²))^3.

So (10x³)^2 is 100x^6. (-1/(2x²))^3 is (-1)^3/(2^3 x^6) = -1/8x^6. So multiplying 100x^6 by -1/(8x^6) gives (100 * -1/8) * (x^6 / x^6) = -12.5 * 1 = -12.5. Then multiply by 10: -12.5 * 10 = -125. 

Yes, that's correct. So the constant term is -125. 

But let me check if there's another term that could contribute to the constant term. For example, maybe when k is different? But since n=5, k can only be from 0 to 5. We found k=3 gives the exponent of x as zero. Let's check another k just to be thorough.

For example, k=0: exponent is 15 -5*0=15, which is not zero. k=1: 15 -5=10, not zero. k=2:15 -10=5, not zero. k=4:15 -20= -5, not zero. k=5:15 -25= -10, not zero. So only k=3 gives exponent zero. Therefore, only one term contributes to the constant term, which is -125.
