</Question>

<think>
<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to figure out the smallest positive integer value of \( a \) such that the sum of the geometric series \( 4 + \frac{12}{a} + \frac{36}{a^2} + \cdots \) is a perfect square. Let me start by recalling some basic concepts about geometric series.

First, a geometric series is a series where each term after the first is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the common ratio (\( r \)). The sum of an infinite geometric series can be found using the formula \( S = \frac{a_1}{1 - r} \), where \( a_1 \) is the first term and \( r \) is the common ratio, provided that \( |r| < 1 \).

Looking at the given series: \( 4 + \frac{12}{a} + \frac{36}{a^2} + \cdots \). Let me identify the first term and the common ratio.

<prompt_1.1> Identify the first term and common ratio of the given geometric series. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
The first term \( a_1 \) is 4. To find the common ratio \( r \), I can divide the second term by the first term: \( \frac{\frac{12}{a}}{4} = \frac{12}{a} \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{a} \). Let me check if this ratio holds for the next term: \( \frac{\frac{36}{a^2}}{\frac{12}{a}} = \frac{36}{a^2} \times \frac{a}{12} = \frac{36}{12a} = \frac{3}{a} \). So, the common ratio \( r = \frac{3}{a} \).

For the series to converge, the absolute value of the common ratio must be less than 1. Since \( a \) is a positive integer, \( r = \frac{3}{a} \) is positive, so we just need \( \frac{3}{a} < 1 \), which implies \( a > 3 \). Therefore, \( a \) must be an integer greater than 3.
</execution_1.1>
</Execution_1>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Now, the sum \( S \) of the series is \( \frac{4}{1 - \frac{3}{a}} \). Let me simplify that expression.

<prompt_2.1> Simplify the expression for the sum of the series and set it to be a perfect square. </prompt_2.1>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
First, the denominator is \( 1 - \frac{3}{a} = \frac{a - 3}{a} \). Therefore, the sum becomes \( \frac{4}{\frac{a - 3}{a}} = 4 \times \frac{a}{a - 3} = \frac{4a}{a - 3} \).

We are told that this sum is a perfect square. Let me denote the sum as \( S = \frac{4a}{a - 3} \). We need \( S \) to be a perfect square. Let me set \( \frac{4a}{a - 3} = k^2 \), where \( k \) is a positive integer (since \( a \) is a positive integer greater than 3, the sum \( S \) will also be positive).

So, solving for \( a \), we have:

\( \frac{4a}{a - 3} = k^2 \)

Multiply both sides by \( a - 3 \):

\( 4a = k^2(a - 3) \)

Expanding the right side:

\( 4a = k^2a - 3k^2 \)

Bring all terms to one side:

\( 4a - k^2a + 3k^2 = 0 \)

Factor out \( a \):

\( a(4 - k^2) + 3k^2 = 0 \)

Solving for \( a \):

\( a(4 - k^2) = -3k^2 \)

Multiply both sides by -1:

\( a(k^2 - 4) = 3k^2 \)

Therefore:

\( a = \frac{3k^2}{k^2 - 4} \)

Simplify the expression:

\( a = \frac{3k^2}{k^2 - 4} = 3 + \frac{12}{k^2 - 4} \)

Wait, let me check that. Let me perform the division:


-----

But let me check if there is a smaller \( a \). For example, maybe when \( k \) is larger, but \( a \) becomes smaller?

Wait, but as \( k \) increases, \( k^2 - 4 \) increases, so the denominator of \( \frac{3k^2}{k^2 - 4} \) increases, so the value of \( a \) approaches 3 from above. But since \( a \) must be an integer greater than 3, the next possible integer is 4, but when \( k = 3 \), we get \( a = 4 \). So that's the minimal.

But wait, let me check if there's another \( k \) that could lead to a smaller \( a \). For example, if \( k = 1 \), then \( a = 3*1/(1 -4) = 3/-3 = -1 \), which is invalid. \( k = 2 \), as above, gives \( a = 12 \). \( k = 3 \) gives 4. So 4 is the smallest possible.

But let me check with \( k = 4 \), we get \( a = 3*16/(16 -4) = 48/12 = 4 \). Same as before.

Wait, but maybe there is a different approach where even if \( k \) is not integer, but the sum is a square. Wait, no, because \( k \) is the square root of the sum, which is a rational number? Wait, the sum is \( \frac{4a}{a - 3} \), which must be a perfect square. So \( \frac{4a}{a - 3} \) must be the square of a rational number? Wait, but since \( a \) is an integer, \( \frac{4a}{a - 3} \) is a rational number. For it to be a perfect square, it must be the square of a rational number. However, since the problem states that the sum is a perfect square, and perfect squares of rational numbers are squares of integers if the original number is integral. Wait, but maybe not necessarily. For example, \( \frac{9}{4} \) is a square of \( \frac{3}{2} \), but it's not an integer. However, the problem says "the sum is a perfect square". If the sum is required to be an integer perfect square, then \( \frac{4a}{a - 3} \) must be an integer. Let's see.

Based on execution_2.1:
Let me denote \( S = \frac{4a}{a - 3} \). For \( S \) to be an integer, \( a - 3 \) must divide \( 4a \). Let's write that as \( a - 3 | 4a \).

<prompt_3.1> Determine the condition for \( S \) to be an integer and explore possible values of \( k \). </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
But \( a - 3 \) divides \( 4a \), and since \( a - 3 \) and \( a \) are coprime? Let's check. Let \( d = \gcd(a - 3, a) \). Then \( d \) divides \( a \) and \( a - 3 \), so it divides \( 3 \). Therefore, \( \gcd(a - 3, a) \) is either 1 or 3.

Therefore, \( a - 3 \) divides \( 4a \), so \( a - 3 \) divides \( 4a \). Since \( \gcd(a - 3, a) \) is 1 or 3, we can write \( a - 3 \) divides 4 times a number coprime to it, so \( a - 3 \) divides 4*3=12 if gcd is 3, or divides 4*1=4 if gcd is 1.

Wait, maybe another approach. Let me express \( \frac{4a}{a - 3} \) as \( 4 + \frac{12}{a - 3} \). Because:

\( \frac{4a}{a - 3} = \frac{4(a - 3) + 12}{a - 3} = 4 + \frac{12}{a - 3} \)

Therefore, \( S = 4 + \frac{12}{a - 3} \). Since \( S \) must be a perfect square, let's denote \( S = n^2 \), where \( n \) is a positive integer. Therefore:

\( 4 + \frac{12}{a - 3} = n^2 \)

Subtract 4 from both sides:

\( \frac{12}{a - 3} = n^2 - 4 \)

Therefore:

\( a - 3 = \frac{12}{n^2 - 4} \)

Since \( a - 3 \) must be a positive integer (because \( a \) is an integer greater than 3), \( n^2 - 4 \) must be a positive divisor of 12. So \( n^2 - 4 \) divides 12 and \( n^2 - 4 > 0 \), so \( n^2 > 4 \), which implies \( n \geq 3 \) (since \( n \) is a positive integer).

Let me list the positive divisors of 12:

1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12

Therefore, \( n^2 - 4 \) must be one of these divisors. Let's check which \( n \) satisfy \( n^2 - 4 \) being a divisor of 12.

Start with \( n = 3 \):

\( n^2 - 4 = 9 - 4 = 5 \). 5 is not a divisor of 12. So discard.

Next, \( n = 4 \):

\( 16 - 4 = 12 \). 12 is a divisor of 12. So \( a - 3 = 12 / 12 = 1 \), so \( a = 4 \).

Next, \( n = 5 \):

\( 25 - 4 = 21 \). 21 is not a divisor of 12. Discard.

\( n = 2 \):

Wait, \( n \geq 3 \), so we don't need to check n=2. Wait, but n=2 would give \( n^2 -4 = 0 \), which would make \( a -3 \) undefined. So n must be at least 3.

Wait, but let's check n=1 and n=2 just in case:

n=1: \( 1 -4 = -3 \), which is negative, so \( a -3 \) would be negative, which is invalid since \( a >3 \).

n=2: \( 4 -4 = 0 \), division by zero, so invalid.

Therefore, the only possible n is 4, which gives \( a =4 \).

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
Wait, but hold on. Let's check if there are other possible divisors.

Wait, the divisors of 12 are 1,2,3,4,6,12.

<prompt_4.1> Re-evaluate possible values of \( n \) and confirm the smallest \( a \). </prompt_4.1>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
But \( n^2 -4 \) must be one of these. Let's check each divisor:

If \( n^2 -4 =1 \), then \( n^2=5 \), which is not a perfect square.

If \( n^2 -4=2 \), then \( n^2=6 \), not a perfect square.

If \( n^2 -4=3 \), then \( n^2=7 \), not a perfect square.

If \( n^2 -4=4 \), then \( n^2=8 \), not a perfect square.

If \( n^2 -4=6 \), then \( n^2=10 \), not a perfect square.

If \( n^2 -4=12 \), then \( n^2=16 \), which is a perfect square, n=4.

Therefore, the only possible n is 4, leading to a=4.

But wait, is there another way? Let me check. Maybe if \( n^2 -4 \) is a negative divisor of 12? But since \( n^2 -4 \) must be positive (as \( a >3 \)), so negative divisors are irrelevant here.

Therefore, the only possible value is n=4, leading to a=4. But wait, let's verify this.

If a=4, then the series is 4 + 12/4 + 36/16 + ... = 4 + 3 + 9/4 + 27/16 + ... The common ratio r=3/4.

Sum S= 4/(1 - 3/4)=4/(1/4)=16, which is 4², a perfect square. So that works.

But wait, is there a smaller a? The problem asks for the smallest possible value of a where a is a positive integer. Since a must be greater than 3, the possible candidates are 4,5,6,... Since we found a=4 works, which is the smallest possible, then 4 is the answer.

But let me check if maybe for a=5 or 6, the sum is also a perfect square but with a smaller a? Wait, a=4 is already the smallest possible. Since a must be greater than 3, the next integer is 4. Therefore, 4 is the minimal.

But just to be thorough, let's check if for a=5, the sum is a perfect square. For a=5, the sum is 4a/(a-3)=20/2=10, which is not a perfect square. For a=6, sum=24/3=8, not a perfect square. a=7, sum=28/4=7, not a perfect square. a=8, sum=32/5=6.4, not integer. a=9, sum=36/6=6, not a square. a=10, sum=40/7≈5.714, not integer. a=12, sum=48/9=16/3≈5.333, not integer. a=16, sum=64/13≈4.923, nope. a=5 gives 10, which is not a square. a=4 is the only one so far that works.

Wait, but let's go back to the equation \( a -3 = \frac{12}{n^2 -4} \). Since \( a -3 \) must be a positive integer, \( n^2 -4 \) must be a positive divisor of 12. The possible positive divisors of 12 are 1,2,3,4,6,12. So as before, n^2 -4 must be one of these. We saw that only n^2 -4=12 gives a valid n=4. Therefore, a=4 is the only solution. Therefore, the answer is 4.

<Plan_5>
Based on execution_4.1:
Wait, but let me check if n^2 -4 can be a fraction. But since n is an integer, n^2 -4 must also be an integer.
Therefore, the only possible case is n=4, leading to a=4. Therefore, the answer is 4.

But wait, the problem says "the sum is a perfect square".

<prompt_5.1> Confirm the solution and ensure no smaller \( a \) exists. </prompt_5.1>
</Plan_5>

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
If the sum is allowed to be a square of a non-integer, then technically any sum that is a square of a rational number would work, but since the problem mentions "a perfect square" without specifying, but since the answer is an integer, it's likely referring to a perfect square of an integer. Because if it allowed for a square of a non-integer, then there could be infinitely many solutions. However, in the context of the problem, since \( a \) is an integer, and the sum is expressed in terms of \( a \), it's more natural to assume that the sum must be the square of an integer. Therefore, our previous reasoning holds.

Thus, the smallest possible \( a \) is 4.

<Plan_6>
Based on execution_5.1:
But let me check once more for possible mistakes. For instance, when I set \( S = k^2 \), is there a possibility that \( k \) could be a fraction, leading to a different \( a \)?

<prompt_6.1> Perform a final verification and conclude the solution. </prompt_6.1>
</Plan_6>

<Execution_6>
<execution_6.1>
But if \( S \) is a perfect square, and \( S = \frac{4a}{a -3} \), then \( S \) must be a square of a rational number. However, since \( a \) is an integer, \( S \) is a rational number. For \( S \) to be a perfect square in the ring of integers, it must be the square of an integer. Otherwise, if \( S \) is a square of a fraction, say \( (\frac{p}{q})^2 \), then \( \frac{4a}{a -3} = \frac{p^2}{q^2} \), leading to \( 4a q^2 = p^2 (a -3) \). But this would complicate things, and since the problem doesn't specify, it's safer to assume that the sum must be a perfect square of an integer. Therefore, our initial approach is correct.

Therefore, after thorough analysis, the smallest possible value of \( a \) is 4.
</execution_6.1>
</Execution_6>

<Final_answer>
Thus, the smallest possible value of $a$ where $a$ is a positive integer is $\boxed{4}$.
