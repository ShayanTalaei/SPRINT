<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to simplify the product of four cosine terms: cos(2π/15) cos(4π/15) cos(8π/15) cos(16π/15). Hmm, let's see. I remember that products of cosines can sometimes be simplified using trigonometric identities, maybe product-to-sum formulas? But with four terms, that might get complicated. Let me think step by step.

First, let me note the angles involved: 2π/15, 4π/15, 8π/15, and 16π/15. Wait, 16π/15 is more than π, since π is 15π/15.
So 16π/15 is π + π/15. And cosine of angles greater than π can be expressed using the identity cos(π + θ) = -cos(θ). So cos(16π/15) = cos(π + π/15) = -cos(π/15). That might be useful. So maybe I can rewrite the original product as:

cos(2π/15) cos(4π/15) cos(8π/15) (-cos(π/15)) = -cos(π/15) cos(2π/15) cos(4π/15) cos(8π/15)

So the problem reduces to simplifying -cos(π/15) cos(2π/15) cos(4π/15) cos(8π/15). Now, I need to compute this product. Maybe there's a known product formula for multiple angles?

Alternatively, perhaps using complex exponentials? Let me recall that cosθ = (e^(iθ) + e^(-iθ))/2. But multiplying four such terms might be tedious, but maybe manageable.

Alternatively, I remember that for roots of unity, products of certain cosines can be evaluated. Let me think. The 15th roots of unity are e^(2πik/15) for k=0 to 14. The minimal polynomials and product formulas might be related. But I need to find a product of specific cosines.

Wait, another idea: there's a formula for the product of cosines with angles in geometric progression. Let me check if the angles here form a geometric progression.

<prompt_1.1> Check if the angles form a geometric progression and calculate the common ratio. </prompt_1.1>

But in our case, the angles are 2π/15, 4π/15, 8π/15, 16π/15. Wait, 16π/15 is equivalent to 16π/15 - 2π = 16π/15 - 30π/15 = -14π/15. But cosine is even, so cos(16π/15) = cos(14π/15). Wait, but 14π/15 is π - π/15, and cos(π - θ) = -cosθ, so cos(14π/15) = -cos(π/15). Which matches the earlier result. So maybe we can pair the terms.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that 2π/15, 4π/15, 8π/15, 16π/15. Let's note that 16π/15 is the same as 2π/15 * 8, but that might not help directly. Alternatively, maybe group the terms into pairs.

<prompt_1.2> Attempt to pair the terms and simplify the product using trigonometric identities. </prompt_1.2>

But let me verify this. Let's compute the numerical value of the original product and compare it to 1/8.

The angles are 2π/15, 4π/15, 8π/15, 16π/15. Wait, 16π/15 is actually more than 2π, right? Because 15π/15 is π, so 16π/15 is π + π/15. But if we consider the angles as 2π/15, 4π/15, 8π/15, and then 16π/15, which is equivalent to -14π/15 (since 16π/15 - 2π = -14π/15). But maybe it's better to work with angles between 0 and 2π. So 16π/15 is just 16π/15, which is in the third quadrant. But as we saw, cos(16π/15) = -cos(π/15). So if we rewrite the product, it's -cos(π/15) cos(2π/15) cos(4π/15) cos(8π/15). So the four angles are π/15, 2π/15, 4π/15, 8π/15, all multiplied together, and then a negative sign. So the angles are doubling each time: π/15, 2π/15, 4π/15, 8π/15. So each angle is 2 times the previous one. So that's a geometric progression with ratio 2. So maybe there's a formula for such products.
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
For example, cos(2π/15) cos(8π/15) and cos(4π/15) cos(16π/15). Let's try that.

Using the product-to-sum formula: cos A cos B = [cos(A+B) + cos(A-B)] / 2.

First pair: cos(2π/15) cos(8π/15) = [cos(10π/15) + cos(-6π/15)] / 2 = [cos(2π/3) + cos(6π/15)] / 2. Wait, cos(-θ) = cosθ, so that's correct. cos(10π/15) is cos(2π/3) which is -1/2. cos(6π/15) is cos(2π/5). So first pair becomes [-1/2 + cos(2π/5)] / 2.

Similarly, second pair: cos(4π/15) cos(16π/15). But 16π/15 is equivalent to 16π/15 - 2π = -14π/15, so cos(16π/15) = cos(14π/15) = cos(π - π/15) = -cos(π/15). So cos(4π/15) cos(16π/15) = -cos(4π/15) cos(π/15). Then using product-to-sum again: - [cos(5π/15) + cos(3π/15)] / 2 = - [cos(π/3) + cos(π/5)] / 2. cos(π/3) is 1/2, so this becomes - [1/2 + cos(π/5)] / 2.
</execution_1.2>

<execution_1.3>
Compute cos(2π/15) cos(4π/15) cos(8π/15) cos(16π/15):

First, convert radians to degrees for easier computation:

2π/15 ≈ 24°, 4π/15 ≈ 48°, 8π/15 ≈ 96°, 16π/15 ≈ 192°.

Compute each cosine:

cos(24°) ≈ 0.9135

cos(48°) ≈ 0.6691

cos(96°) ≈ -0.1045

cos(192°) ≈ -0.9781

Multiply them all together:

0.9135 * 0.6691 ≈ 0.6113

0.6113 * (-0.1045) ≈ -0.0639

-0.0639 * (-0.9781) ≈ 0.0625

0.0625 is approximately 1/16. Wait, but according to the previous result, the product is 1/8. But here, the numerical value is approximately 0.0625, which is 1/16. Hmm, discrepancy here. So something's wrong.

Based on execution_1.2:
Hmm, maybe this approach is getting too complicated. Let me think of another way.

Wait, perhaps using multiple angle identities or recursive formulas. I remember that for products of cosines with angles in geometric progression, there is a formula. Let me recall.

Wait, let's check the numerical value again with more precision.

Compute each cosine:

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
If we have cosθ cos2θ cos4θ ... cos(2^{n-1}θ), then the product is sin(2^n θ) / (2^n sinθ). Let me verify this formula. Suppose we start with sinθ. Then, using the identity sin(2θ) = 2 sinθ cosθ, so cosθ = sin(2θ)/(2 sinθ). Then, cosθ cos2θ = [sin(2θ)/(2 sinθ)] * [sin(4θ)/(2 sin2θ)] = sin(4θ)/(4 sinθ). Continuing this way, each time multiplying by cos(2^k θ) gives sin(2^{k+1}θ)/(2^{k+1} sinθ). So indeed, the product of cosθ cos2θ cos4θ ... cos(2^{n-1}θ) = sin(2^n θ)/(2^n sinθ). That seems correct.

But in our problem, the angles are π/15, 2π/15, 4π/15, 8π/15. So starting with θ = π/15, then 2θ = 2π/15, 4θ = 4π/15, 8θ = 8π/15. So the product cos(π/15) cos(2π/15) cos(4π/15) cos(8π/15) would be sin(16π/15)/(16 sin(π/15)). Wait, 2^4 θ = 16π/15. So the product is sin(16π/15)/(16 sin(π/15)). Then, sin(16π/15) = sin(π + π/15) = -sin(π/15). Therefore, the product is -sin(π/15)/(16 sin(π/15)) = -1/16. Therefore, the product cos(π/15) cos(2π/15) cos(4π/15) cos(8π/15) = -1/16.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
cos(2π/15): 2π/15 ≈ 0.418879 radians. cos(0.418879) ≈ 0.909631

cos(4π/15): ≈0.841129

cos(8π/15): ≈0.587785

cos(16π/15): 16π/15 ≈ 3.35103 radians. cos(3.35103) ≈ -0.978148

Now multiply them all:

0.909631 * 0.841129 ≈ 0.909631 * 0.841129 ≈ Let's compute 0.9 * 0.84 = 0.756, but more accurately:

0.909631 * 0.841129:

Multiply 0.909631 * 0.8 = 0.7277048

0.909631 * 0.04 = 0.03638524

0.909631 * 0.001129 ≈ 0.001028

Adding up: 0.7277048 + 0.03638524 ≈ 0.76409 + 0.001028 ≈ 0.765118

Then multiply by cos(8π/15) ≈ 0.587785:

0.765118 * 0.587785 ≈ 0.765118 * 0.5 = 0.382559, 0.765118 * 0.08 = 0.061209, 0.765118 * 0.007785 ≈ ~0.00594

Adding up: 0.382559 + 0.061209 ≈ 0.443768 + 0.00594 ≈ 0.449708

Then multiply by cos(16π/15) ≈ -0.978148:

0.449708 * (-0.978148) ≈ -0.449708 * 0.978148 ≈ Let's compute 0.45 * 0.978 ≈ 0.4401, so approximately -0.4401.

Wait, but that's the original product without the negative sign. The original product was -cos(π/15) cos(2π/15) cos(4π/15) cos(8π/15). Wait, the original product is cos(2π/15) cos(4π/15) cos(8π/15) cos(16π/15). Which we converted to -cos(π/15) times the product of the other three. But according to the numerical calculation, the original product is approximately -0.4401. But if the simplified expression is 1/8, then -1/8 is -0.125, which is not matching. So there's a problem here.

Wait, but according to the earlier symbolic computation, we had:

Original product = - [1/8] = -1/8. But the numerical calculation gives approximately -0.44, which is about -7/16, which is approximately -0.4375. Wait, 0.44 is close to 7/16 (0.4375). Hmm, so maybe the exact value is -7/16? But that contradicts the symbolic result. So there must be an error in the symbolic computation.

</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
But in our problem, we have a negative sign outside: -cos(π/15) times that product. So the total expression is -1/16. But wait, according to the formula, the product cos(π/15) cos(2π/15) cos(4π/15) cos(8π/15) is -1/16, so the original expression is - (-1/16) = 1/16? Wait, no.

<prompt_3.1> Verify the result obtained from the formula and determine the sign. </prompt_3.1>
-----

But wait, let me check the formula again. The formula says that the product from k=0 to n-1 of cos(θ 2^k) = sin(2^n θ)/(2^n sinθ). In our case, θ = π/15, and we have four terms: k=0 to 3, so n=4. Then the product is sin(16θ)/(16 sinθ) = sin(16π/15)/(16 sinπ/15). But 16π/15 = π + π/15, so sin(16π/15) = -sin(π/15). Therefore, the product is -sin(π/15)/(16 sinπ/15) = -1/16.

Based on execution_2.2:
Wait, let me check my numerical calculation again. Let me use more accurate values.

<prompt_3.2> Verify the numerical calculation and confirm the exact value of the simplified expression. </prompt_3.2>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
Wait, the original problem is:

cos(2π/15) cos(4π/15) cos(8π/15) cos(16π/15) = -cos(π/15) cos(2π/15) cos(4π/15) cos(8π/15) = - [ product ].

But according to the formula, the product cos(π/15) cos(2π/15) cos(4π/15) cos(8π/15) = sin(16π/15)/(16 sin(π/15)) = (-sin π/15)/(16 sin π/15) = -1/16. Therefore, the original expression is - [ -1/16 ] = 1/16. But according to the numerical calculation, the original product (without the negative sign) was approximately -0.44, which is close to -7/16 ≈ -0.4375. Wait, but 1/16 is 0.0625, which is not close to -0.44. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, either my symbolic computation is wrong or the numerical computation is wrong.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
First, compute each cosine with more precision:

2π/15 ≈ 0.418879 radians:

cos(0.418879) = cos(2π/15). Let's compute it more accurately. Using calculator:

cos(2π/15) ≈ 0.9135454576426909

4π/15 ≈ 0.837758 radians:

cos(4π/15) ≈ 0.6691306063588582

8π/15 ≈ 1.675516 radians:

cos(8π/15) ≈ -0.10452846326765345

16π/15 ≈ 3.351032 radians:

cos(16π/15) ≈ cos(π + π/15) = -cos(π/15) ≈ -0.9781476009627247

Now multiply all four terms:

First, 0.9135454576426909 * 0.6691306063588582 ≈

Let me compute this step by step:

0.9135454576 * 0.6 = 0.5481272746

0.9135454576 * 0.06 = 0.05481272746

0.9135454576 * 0.009130606358 ≈ 0.9135454576 * 0.009 ≈ 0.00822191

Adding those up: 0.5481272746 + 0.05481272746 ≈ 0.60294 + 0.00822191 ≈ 0.61116191

So approximately 0.61116191

Next, multiply this by cos(8π/15) ≈ -0.10452846326765345:

0.61116191 * (-0.10452846326765345) ≈ -0.61116191 * 0.10452846 ≈ Let's compute 0.6 * 0.1 = 0.06, 0.6 * 0.0045 ≈ 0.0027, 0.01116 * 0.1 ≈ 0.001116, 0.01116 * 0.0045 ≈ 0.00005022. Adding up: 0.06 + 0.0027 = 0.0627 + 0.001116 = 0.063816 + 0.00005022 ≈ 0.063866. So total is approximately -0.063866.

Then multiply by cos(16π/15) ≈ -0.9781476009627247:

-0.063866 * (-0.9781476009627247) ≈ 0.063866 * 0.9781476 ≈ Let's compute 0.06 * 0.978 ≈ 0.05868, 0.003866 * 0.978 ≈ 0.00378. So total ≈ 0.05868 + 0.00378 ≈ 0.06246.

So approximately 0.06246. Which is approximately 1/16 (0.0625). So that matches the symbolic result. Therefore, the original product is approximately 1/16. But according to the earlier formula, the product cos(π/15) cos(2π/15) cos(4π/15) cos(8π/15) is -1/16, so the original expression is -(-1/16) = 1/16. But in the problem, the original product is cos(2π/15) cos(4π/15) cos(8π/15) cos(16π/15) which we converted to -cos(π/15) times the product of the other three. Wait, no, let's clarify:

Original product: cos(2π/15) cos(4π/15) cos(8π/15) cos(16π/15). We noticed that cos(16π/15) = -cos(π/15). Therefore, the original product is equal to -cos(π/15) * cos(2π/15) cos(4π/15) cos(8π/15). Then, according to the formula, the product cos(π/15) cos(2π/15) cos(4π/15) cos(8π/15) = -1/16. Therefore, substituting back, we have -cos(π/15) * [ -1/(16 cos(π/15)) ] = 1/16. Because:

Let me write it again:

Original product = cos(2π/15) cos(4π/15) cos(8π/15) cos(16π/15) = cos(2π/15) cos(4π/15) cos(8π/15) (-cos(π/15)) = -cos(π/15) cos(2π/15) cos(4π/15) cos(8π/15). Then, the product in the brackets is -1/16, so this becomes - (-1/16) = 1/16. Therefore, the answer is 1/16. But according to the numerical calculation, the original product is approximately 1/16 (0.0625). So that matches. Therefore, the simplified expression is 1/16.

But wait, according to the formula, the product from k=0 to 3 of cos(2^k θ) = sin(2^4 θ)/(2^4 sinθ). So with θ = π/15, the product is sin(16θ)/(16 sinθ) = sin(16π/15)/(16 sinπ/15) = sin(π + π/15)/(16 sinπ/15) = -sin(π/15)/(16 sinπ/15) = -1/16. Therefore, the product cos(π/15) cos(2π/15) cos(4π/15) cos(8π/15) = -1/16. Therefore, the original product is - [ -1/16 ] = 1/16. So the answer is 1/16. But according to the numerical calculation, yes, that's exactly what we get. The original product is approximately 0.0625, which is 1/16. So that must be the answer. Therefore, the simplified form is 1/16.

Wait, but let me check again. The problem was to simplify cos(2π/15) cos(4π/15) cos(8π/15) cos(16π/15). We converted 16π/15 to -cos(π/15). Then, the product becomes -cos(π/15) times the product of cos(2π/15), cos(4π/15), cos(8π/15). Then, the product of those four terms (including cos(π/15)) is -1/16, so the original product is -(-1/16) = 1/16. Yes, that seems correct.
