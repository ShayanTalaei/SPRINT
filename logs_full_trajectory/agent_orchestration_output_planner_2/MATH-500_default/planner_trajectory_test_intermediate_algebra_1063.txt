<Question>
Let $F(z)=\frac{z+i}{z-i}$ for all complex numbers $z\not= i,$ and let $z_n=F(z_{n-1})$ for all positive integers $n.$ Given that $z_0=\frac 1{137}+i,$ find $z_{2002}.$
</Question>

<think>
<Plan_1>
Okay, let's try to solve this problem step by step. The function given is F(z) = (z + i)/(z - i), and we have a recursive sequence where z_n = F(z_{n-1}) for each positive integer n. The initial value is z_0 = 1/137 + i. We need to find z_{2002}. Hmm, that seems like a lot of iterations, but maybe there's a pattern or cycle that repeats after some steps. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, let me understand the function F(z). It's a Möbius transformation, right? Möbius transformations have interesting properties, especially when iterated. They can sometimes lead to periodic sequences, which would be helpful here since we need to compute a term far ahead like z_{2002}.
Let me recall that Möbius transformations can be represented as matrices, and their composition corresponds to matrix multiplication. Maybe that could help in finding a cycle or a closed-form expression.

Alternatively, perhaps computing the first few terms manually will reveal a pattern. If I compute z_1, z_2, z_3, etc.
, maybe the sequence repeats every few steps. Let's try that.

Given z_0 = 1/137 + i. Let's compute z_1 = F(z_0).

Compute z_1:

F(z) = (z + i)/(z - i)

So, substituting z = z_0:

<prompt_1.1> Compute z_1 using the function F(z) with z_0 = 1/137 + i. </prompt_1.1>

Now compute z_2 = F(z_1). Let's do that:

<prompt_1.2> Compute z_2 using the function F(z) with z_1. </prompt_1.2>

Now compute z_3 = F(z_2):

<prompt_1.3> Compute z_3 using the function F(z) with z_2. </prompt_1.3>

Hmm, interesting. So z_3 = z_0. That suggests that the sequence is periodic with period 3.
So every three steps, it repeats. Therefore, the sequence cycles every 3 terms: z_0, z_1, z_2, z_0, z_1, z_2, etc.

Therefore, to find z_{2002}, we can find 2002 modulo 3. Let's compute 2002 divided by 3.

<prompt_1.4> Determine the value of z_{2002} using the periodicity of the sequence. </prompt_1.4>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
z_1 = (z_0 + i)/(z_0 - i) = [(1/137 + i) + i]/[(1/137 + i) - i] = (1/137 + 2i)/(1/137)

Since the denominator is 1/137, we can multiply numerator and denominator by 137 to simplify:

= [1 + 2i*137]/1 = 1 + 274i

So z_1 = 1 + 274i.
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
First, we need z_1 = (z_0 + i)/(z_0 - i). Let's compute numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: z_0 + i = (1/137 + i) + i = 1/137 + 2i

Denominator: z_0 - i = (1/137 + i) - i = 1/137

Therefore, z_1 = (1/137 + 2i) / (1/137) = [1/137 divided by 1/137] + [2i divided by 1/137] = 1 + 2i * 137 = 1 + 274i

So z_1 = 1 + 274i.
</execution_1.2>

<execution_1.3>
First, z_2 is (-i - 2)/(1 - 2i). Let me rationalize that. Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + 2i):

Numerator: (-i - 2)(1 + 2i) = (-2)(1) + (-2)(2i) + (-i)(1) + (-i)(2i)
= -2 - 4i - i - 2i^2
= -2 -5i + 2 (since i^2 = -1)
= 0 -5i

Denominator: (1 - 2i)(1 + 2i) = 1 + 4 = 5

So z_2 = (-5i)/5 = -i
</execution_1.3>

<execution_1.4>
3*667 = 2001, so 2002 = 3*667 +1. Therefore, 2002 ≡1 mod 3. Hence, z_{2002} = z_1.
</execution_1.4>
</Execution_1>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.4:
Wait, let me confirm:

Wait, z_0 is the 0th term, then z_1 is the first term, so the nth term corresponds to n iterations.

<prompt_2.1> Confirm the calculation of z_{2002} using the periodicity. </prompt_2.1>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
So if we have periodicity 3, then the terms cycle every 3 steps. So z_0, z_1, z_2, z_0, z_1, z_2, etc. Therefore, z_n = z_{n mod 3}. But since z_0 is the starting point, when n is a multiple of 3, it's back to z_0. So for n = 3k, z_n = z_0; for n = 3k+1, z_n = z_1; for n = 3k+2, z_n = z_2.

Therefore, to compute z_{2002}, we compute 2002 divided by 3. As 3*667=2001, so 2002=3*667 +1. Therefore, 2002 ≡1 mod3. So z_{2002}=z_1=1 +274i.

Wait, but let me check again. Let's list the terms:

z_0 = z_0

z_1 = F(z_0)

z_2 = F(z_1)

z_3 = F(z_2) = z_0

z_4 = F(z_3) = F(z_0) = z_1

z_5 = F(z_4) = z_2

z_6 = F(z_5) = z_0

So yes, every multiple of 3, it cycles back. So the period is 3. Therefore, z_n = z_{n mod3}. But since the remainder when dividing by 3 can be 0,1,2. However, z_0 corresponds to n=0, which is 0 mod3. Then z_1 is 1 mod3, z_2 is 2 mod3, z_3 is 0 mod3, etc. Therefore, in general, z_n = z_{n mod3} when n mod3 is 0,1,2. But since z_0 is the starting point, maybe the formula is z_n = z_{n mod3} if we consider that z_0 is term number 0. So for term number 2002, we compute 2002 mod3.

2002 divided by 3: 3*667=2001, so 2002=3*667 +1. Therefore, 2002 mod3=1. Therefore, z_{2002}=z_1=1 +274i.

But let me verify this with another approach to make sure.

Alternatively, perhaps we can represent the function F(z) as a matrix and analyze its powers. Möbius transformations can be associated with matrices up to a scalar multiple. The function F(z) = (z + i)/(z - i) can be represented by the matrix:

M = [[1, i],
     [1, -i]]

Then, composition of Möbius transformations corresponds to multiplication of their matrices. Therefore, iterating F corresponds to taking powers of matrix M. If we can diagonalize M or find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, we might be able to compute M^n efficiently.

Let's try that approach.

First, compute the trace and determinant of M.
</execution_2.1>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Trace Tr(M) = 1 + (-i) = 1 - i

Determinant Det(M) = (1)(-i) - (i)(1) = -i - i = -2i

So the characteristic equation is λ^2 - (1 - i)λ + (-2i) = 0

Solving for λ:

<prompt_3.1> Find the eigenvalues of the matrix M. </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
λ = [ (1 - i) ± sqrt( (1 - i)^2 - 4*1*(-2i) ) ] / 2

Compute discriminant D:

(1 - i)^2 - 4*(-2i) = (1 - 2i + i^2) + 8i = (1 - 2i -1) +8i = (-2i) +8i =6i

So sqrt(D) = sqrt(6i). Hmm, need to compute square roots of 6i. Let's recall that sqrt(a + ib) can be found by solving (x + iy)^2 = a + ib. Let me compute sqrt(6i).

Let sqrt(6i) = x + iy. Then (x + iy)^2 = x^2 - y^2 + 2ixy = 6i. Therefore, equating real and imaginary parts:

x^2 - y^2 = 0

2xy = 6

From x^2 - y^2 =0, we have x = ±y. Then 2xy =6 => xy=3. If x = y, then x^2=3 => x= sqrt(3), y=sqrt(3). Therefore, sqrt(6i) = sqrt(3) + i sqrt(3). Alternatively, the negative root would be -sqrt(3) - i sqrt(3). So sqrt(D) = sqrt(6i) = ±(sqrt(3) + i sqrt(3)).

Therefore, the eigenvalues are:

[ (1 - i) ± (sqrt(3) + i sqrt(3)) ] / 2

Let me compute both roots:

First root with + sign:

[1 - i + sqrt(3) + i sqrt(3)] / 2 = [1 + sqrt(3) + i(-1 + sqrt(3))] / 2

Second root with - sign:

[1 - i - sqrt(3) - i sqrt(3)] / 2 = [1 - sqrt(3) + i(-1 - sqrt(3))] / 2

Hmm, these eigenvalues seem a bit complicated. Maybe there's a different approach.
</execution_3.1>
</Execution_3>

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
Alternatively, perhaps instead of using matrices, we can analyze the function F(z) and see if it has any fixed points or periodic points.

A fixed point would satisfy F(z) = z. Let's solve for z:

<prompt_4.1> Find the fixed points of the function F(z). </prompt_4.1>

Alternatively, maybe consider the orbit of z_0 under F. Since we saw that z_3 = z_0, so the orbit cycles every 3 steps. Therefore, the period is 3. Therefore, z_{n} = z_{n mod3}. Therefore, z_{2002} = z_{2002 mod3}=z_1.

But let me verify once again.

Wait, let's compute z_0, z_1, z_2, z_3 to confirm:

<prompt_4.2> Re-verify the periodicity of the sequence by computing the first few terms. </prompt_4.2>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
(z + i)/(z - i) = z

Multiply both sides by (z - i):

z + i = z(z - i)

Expand right-hand side: z^2 - iz

Bring all terms to one side:

z^2 - iz - z - i = 0

Combine like terms:

z^2 - (i +1)z - i =0

Let's solve this quadratic equation:

z = [ (1 + i) ± sqrt( ( - (i +1) )^2 + 4i ) ] /2

Wait, discriminant D = [-(i +1)]^2 +4i = (i +1)^2 +4i

Compute (i +1)^2 = i^2 + 2i +1 = -1 +2i +1 = 2i

Therefore, D = 2i +4i =6i

So sqrt(D)=sqrt(6i), which is the same as before. So sqrt(6i)=sqrt(3)(1 +i), as we found earlier. Therefore,

z = [ (1 + i) ± sqrt(3)(1 +i) ] /2 = [1 +i ± sqrt(3)(1 +i) ] /2 = (1 +i)(1 ± sqrt(3))/2

Therefore, the fixed points are z = (1 +i)(1 ± sqrt(3))/2

But perhaps this is not directly helpful here.
</execution_4.1>

<execution_4.2>
Given z_0 = 1/137 + i

Compute z_1 = F(z_0) = (z_0 + i)/(z_0 - i) = (1/137 + i + i)/(1/137 + i - i) = (1/137 + 2i)/(1/137) = 1 + 274i. That's correct.

Compute z_2 = F(z_1) = (z_1 + i)/(z_1 - i) = (1 + 274i + i)/(1 + 274i - i) = (1 + 275i)/(1 + 273i)

Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:

(1 + 275i)(1 - 273i)/[(1 + 273i)(1 - 273i)] = [1*1 + 1*(-273i) + 275i*1 + 275i*(-273i)] / [1 + (273)^2]

Compute numerator:

1 -273i +275i -275*273 i^2

= 1 + 2i -275*273*(-1)

= 1 + 2i +275*273

Compute 275*273:

275*273: Let's compute 275*200=55,000; 275*70=19,250; 275*3=825. So total 55,000 +19,250=74,250 +825=75,075. Therefore, numerator is 1 +75,075 +2i =75,076 +2i

Denominator:1 +273^2. Compute 273^2:

273^2: (270 +3)^2=270^2 +2*270*3 +3^2=72,900 +1,620 +9=74,529. Therefore, denominator=1 +74,529=74,530

Therefore, z_2 = (75,076 +2i)/74,530. Let's simplify:

Divide numerator and denominator by 2:

(37,538 +i)/37,265 ≈ Let's see, 37,538 /37,265 ≈1.007, and i/37,265≈0.0000268i. Wait, but this seems messy. Wait, but maybe there's a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in calculation. Let's re-examine the computation of z_2.

Wait, z_1 =1 +274i. Then z_2 = F(z_1) = (z_1 +i)/(z_1 -i). Let's substitute:

Numerator: (1 +274i) +i =1 +275i

Denominator: (1 +274i) -i =1 +273i

Therefore, z_2 = (1 +275i)/(1 +273i). Let's compute this:

Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is (1 -273i):

Numerator: (1 +275i)(1 -273i) =1*(1) +1*(-273i) +275i*1 +275i*(-273i)

=1 -273i +275i -275*273 i^2

=1 +2i -275*273*(-1) [since i^2 = -1]

=1 +2i +275*273

As before, 275*273=75,075, so numerator becomes 1 +75,075 +2i =75,076 +2i

Denominator: (1 +273i)(1 -273i) =1^2 - (273i)^2 =1 -273^2*(-1) =1 +273^2

273^2=74,529, so denominator=1 +74,529=74,530

Thus, z_2 = (75,076 +2i)/74,530. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 2:

= (37,538 +i)/37,265

Hmm, this is a complex number, but earlier I thought it might simplify to -i. Wait, maybe there's an error here. Let me check with another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation. Let me compute (1 +275i)/(1 +273i). Let me write this as:

(1 +275i)/(1 +273i) = [ (1 +273i) +2i ] / (1 +273i) = 1 + (2i)/(1 +273i)

Then, (2i)/(1 +273i) = 2i*(1 -273i)/(1 +273^2) = 2i*(1 -273i)/74530

Compute numerator: 2i*(1) -2i*273i =2i -546i^2 =2i +546

Therefore, (2i)/(1 +273i) = (546 +2i)/74530 = (273 +i)/37265

Therefore, z_2 =1 + (273 +i)/37265 ≈1 +0.0073 +0.000027i ≈1.0073 +0.000027i

Wait, that's not equal to -i. So there must be a mistake in my earlier assumption that z_3 = z_0. Wait, so perhaps my initial calculation was wrong? Let me check z_3 again.

Wait, earlier I thought z_3 = z_0, but according to this calculation, z_2 is approximately 1.0073 +0.000027i, which is not -i. Therefore, my previous conclusion that z_3 = z_0 was incorrect. Therefore, the periodicity idea might not hold here. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, let's go back. When I computed z_2, I thought it was -i, but that seems incorrect. Let me re-examine that step.

</Execution_4>

<Plan_5>
Based on execution_4.2:
Wait, originally, I computed z_2 as ( -i -2 )/(1 -2i). Let me check that again.

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
Wait, z_1 was computed as 1 +274i. Then z_2 = F(z_1) = (z_1 +i)/(z_1 -i). So substituting z_1 =1 +274i:

Numerator:1 +274i +i =1 +275i

Denominator:1 +274i -i =1 +273i

So z_2 = (1 +275i)/(1 +273i). Then, to compute this, multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is (1 -273i):

Numerator: (1 +275i)(1 -273i) =1*(1) +1*(-273i) +275i*1 +275i*(-273i)

=1 -273i +275i -275*273 i^2

=1 +2i -275*273*(-1) [since i^2 = -1]

=1 +2i +275*273

Compute 275*273:

275*200=55,000; 275*70=19,250; 275*3=825. So 55,000 +19,250=74,250 +825=75,075. Therefore, numerator is 1 +75,075 +2i =75,076 +2i

Denominator: (1 +273i)(1 -273i) =1^2 - (273i)^2 =1 -273^2*(-1) =1 +273^2

273^2: Let's compute 270^2=72,900, then (270 +3)^2=270^2 +2*270*3 +3^2=72,900 +1,620 +9=74,529. Therefore, denominator=1 +74,529=74,530

Therefore, z_2 = (75,076 +2i)/74,530. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 2:

= (37,538 +i)/37,265 ≈ Let's compute 37,538 /37,265 ≈1.0073 and i/37,265≈0.0000268i. So z_2 ≈1.0073 +0.0000268i, which is very close to 1, but not exactly 1. Wait, but this contradicts my previous calculation where I thought z_2 was -i. So where did I go wrong earlier?

Wait, originally, I thought z_2 was -i, but that must have been a miscalculation. Let me check again. Wait, perhaps I confused the steps. Let me re-examine the original problem.

Wait, the original function is F(z) = (z +i)/(z -i). Then z_0 =1/137 +i. Then z_1=F(z_0)= (z_0 +i)/(z_0 -i)= [(1/137 +i) +i]/[ (1/137 +i) -i ]= [1/137 +2i]/[1/137]. So that's (1/137 +2i)/(1/137)=1 +274i. That's correct. Then z_2=F(z_1)= (z_1 +i)/(z_1 -i)= (1 +274i +i)/(1 +274i -i)= (1 +275i)/(1 +273i). Then, when I computed this, I made an error in the numerator. Wait, 1 +275i +i? Wait, no. Wait, z_1 is 1 +274i. Then z_1 +i is 1 +274i +i =1 +275i. Correct. Then z_1 -i is 1 +274i -i =1 +273i. Correct. Then, when I multiplied numerator and denominator by the conjugate, I think I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's recompute z_2:

(1 +275i)/(1 +273i) multiplied by (1 -273i)/(1 -273i):

Numerator: (1)(1) + (1)(-273i) +275i(1) +275i(-273i)

=1 -273i +275i -275*273 i^2

Now, i^2 = -1, so the last term becomes +275*273

So the numerator is 1 + (275 -273)i +275*273

=1 +2i +75,075 (since 275*273=75,075)

=75,076 +2i

Denominator: (1 +273i)(1 -273i)=1 - (273i)^2=1 -273^2*(-1)=1 +74,529=74,530

Therefore, z_2 = (75,076 +2i)/74,530. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 2:

= (37,538 +i)/37,265 ≈1.0073 +0.000027i. So this is approximately 1.0073 +0.000027i, which is not equal to -i. Therefore, my initial assumption that z_3 = z_0 was incorrect. Therefore, the periodicity idea must have been wrong. Then where did I go wrong earlier?

Wait, in my first calculation, I thought z_2 was -i, but that was a mistake. Let me check how I arrived at that. Wait, perhaps I confused the terms when I first computed z_2. Let me go back to the original problem.

Wait, original z_1 =1 +274i. Then z_2 = F(z_1) = (z_1 +i)/(z_1 -i). Let's compute this step by step:

Numerator: z_1 +i = (1 +274i) +i =1 +275i

Denominator: z_1 -i = (1 +274i) -i =1 +273i

So z_2 = (1 +275i)/(1 +273i). Let's compute this division:

Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is (1 -273i):

Numerator: (1 +275i)(1 -273i) =1*(1) +1*(-273i) +275i*1 +275i*(-273i)

=1 -273i +275i -275*273 i^2

=1 +2i +275*273 (since i^2 = -1)

=1 +2i +75,075

=75,076 +2i

Denominator: (1 +273i)(1 -273i) =1 - (273i)^2 =1 -273^2*(-1) =1 +74,529 =74,530

Therefore, z_2 = (75,076 +2i)/74,530. Let's compute this as a complex number:

First, divide both real and imaginary parts by 2:

= (37,538 +i)/37,265 ≈ (37,538/37,265) + (1/37,265)i ≈1.0073 +0.0000268i

So z_2 is approximately 1.0073 +0.000027i, which is very close to 1 but not exactly 1. Then z_3 = F(z_2) would be F(1.0073 +0.000027i). Let's compute that:

z_3 = (z_2 +i)/(z_2 -i)

Substitute z_2 ≈1.0073 +0.000027i:

Numerator:1.0073 +0.000027i +i ≈1.0073 +1.000027i

Denominator:1.0073 +0.000027i -i ≈1.0073 -0.999973i

So z_3 ≈ (1.0073 +1.000027i)/(1.0073 -0.999973i)

Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:

≈ [ (1.0073 +1.000027i)(1.0073 +0.999973i) ] / [ (1.0073)^2 + (0.999973)^2 ]

Compute denominator first:

≈1.0073^2 +0.999973^2 ≈1.0146 +0.999946≈2.0145

Numerator:

Multiply out:

1.0073*1.0073 +1.0073*0.999973i +1.000027i*1.0073 +1.000027i*0.999973i

≈1.0146 +1.0072i +1.0073i + (1.000027*0.999973)i^2

≈1.0146 +2.0145i + (0.999999)i^2

Since i^2 = -1:

≈1.0146 +2.0145i -0.999999≈0.0146 +2.0145i

Therefore, z_3 ≈(0.0146 +2.0145i)/2.0145≈0.00723 +1.0002i

So z_3 is approximately 0.00723 +1.0002i, which is not equal to z_0 (which was 1/137 +i≈0.0073 +1i). Wait, 1/137≈0.0073, so z_0≈0.0073 +i, while z_3≈0.00723 +1.0002i. These are very close but not exactly the same. Hmm, so perhaps the sequence is returning close to z_0 but not exactly. This suggests that the periodicity might not be 3, but perhaps a longer period. Alternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation.

Wait, but when I computed z_2 earlier, I thought it was -i, but that was incorrect. Let's check that again. Wait, if z_2 were -i, then z_3 would be F(-i). Let's compute F(-i):

Let me check if z_2 could be -i. Suppose z_2 = -i, then z_3 = F(-i) = (-i +i)/(-i -i) =0/(-2i)=0. Then z_4 = F(0)=1 +274i=z_1, which would make the sequence z_2=-i, z_3=0, z_4=z_1, z_5=F(z_4)=z_2=-i, etc. So the cycle would be z_0, z_1, -i, 0, z_1, -i, 0,... which is a cycle of length 3: z_1, -i, 0. But in our calculation, z_2 is not -i, which suggests that this is not the case. Therefore, there must be an error in the initial assumption that led to the belief in periodicity.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed such that despite the apparent lack of periodicity, there's a hidden pattern. Alternatively, maybe there's a fixed point or a rotation in the transformation. Let me consider another approach: perhaps find the orbit of z_0 under F and see if it cycles.

Given that z_0 is 1/137 +i, z_1 is 1 +274i, z_2 is (75,076 +2i)/74,530≈1.0073 +0.000027i, z_3 is computed as approximately 0.00723 +1.0002i, which is close to z_0 but not exactly. This suggests that the sequence is not periodic with period 3, but perhaps converges to a cycle or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the function F has an order, meaning that applying it multiple times brings you back to the original number. For Möbius transformations, if F is periodic with period n, then F^n(z) = z. But in this case, since we have a specific starting point, perhaps after some iterations, it cycles.

Alternatively, perhaps we can represent F as a matrix and compute its powers. Let's try that.

Earlier, we had the matrix M = [[1, i], [1, -i]]. Let's compute M^2:

M^2 = [[1*1 + i*1, 1*i +i*(-i)], [1*1 + (-i)*1, i*1 + (-i)*(-i)]]

Compute each entry:

Top left: 1*1 +i*1 =1 +i

Top right:1*i +i*(-i)=i -i^2= i -(-1)=i +1

Bottom left:1*1 + (-i)*1=1 -i

Bottom right:i*1 + (-i)*(-i)=i + (-i)^2=i + (-1)=i -1

Therefore, M^2 = [[1 +i, 1 +i], [1 -i, -1 +i]]

Hmm, interesting. Then compute M^3:

M^3 = M^2 * M

= [[1 +i, 1 +i], [1 -i, -1 +i]] * [[1, i], [1, -i]]

Compute top left entry:

(1 +i)*1 + (1 +i)*1 = (1 +i) + (1 +i) =2 +2i

Top right entry:

(1 +i)*i + (1 +i)*(-i) =i(1 +i) -i(1 +i) =0

Bottom left entry:

(1 -i)*1 + (-1 +i)*1 = (1 -i) + (-1 +i)=0

Bottom right entry:

(1 -i)*i + (-1 +i)*(-i) =i(1 -i) +i(1 -i) =2i(1 -i)

=2i -2i^2=2i +2

Therefore, M^3 = [[2 +2i, 0], [0, 2i +2]]

Hmm, interesting. Then M^3 is a diagonal matrix? Let's check:

Wait, top left:2 +2i, top right:0; bottom left:0, bottom right:2i +2. So yes, it's a diagonal matrix with entries 2+2i and 2i +2. Therefore, M^3 is diagonal. Therefore, M^3 is a diagonal matrix with entries 2(1 +i) and 2(1 +i) (since 2i +2=2(1 +i)). Wait, 2i +2=2 +2i, which is the same as 2(1 +i). Therefore, M^3 = [[2(1 +i), 0], [0, 2(1 +i)] ] =2(1 +i) * I, where I is the identity matrix.

Therefore, M^3 =2(1 +i) I. Therefore, raising M to the 3rd power gives a scalar multiple of the identity matrix. Therefore, M^3 is a scalar matrix. Therefore, M^6 would be (M^3)^2 = [2(1 +i)]^2 I^2 =4(1 +i)^2 I. Wait, but since M^3 is 2(1 +i)I, then M^6 would be [2(1 +i)]^2 I =4(1 +i)^2 I. But perhaps more importantly, since M^3 is a scalar multiple of the identity, then M^3 acts as scaling by 2(1 +i). Therefore, M^3 * vector =2(1 +i) * vector. Wait, but matrices act on vectors, so if M^3 is 2(1 +i)I, then multiplying M^3 by a vector would scale the vector by 2(1 +i). But in our case, we are dealing with the matrix representation of the transformation. However, since Möbius transformations correspond to projective linear maps, the nth power corresponds to applying the transformation n times. Therefore, if M^3 =2(1 +i)I, then applying F three times would correspond to scaling by 2(1 +i). Therefore, F^3(z) = (2(1 +i)z +0)/(0 +2(1 +i)) = z. Wait, that would imply F^3(z) = z, meaning that applying F three times brings you back to the original value. But this contradicts our earlier numerical calculation where z_3 was not equal to z_0.

Based on execution_6.1:
But according to the matrix calculation, M^3 =2(1 +i)I, so F^3(z) = z.

But according to our earlier calculation with approximate numbers, this didn't hold. Therefore, there must be an error in either the matrix calculation or the interpretation.

Wait, let's check the matrix calculation again. Starting with M:

M = [[1, i], [1, -i]]

Compute M^2:

<prompt_7.1> Verify the matrix calculation for M^3. </prompt_7.1>

Therefore, applying F three times should bring us back to the original complex number. Therefore, F^3(z) = z. Therefore, the sequence z_n is periodic with period 3. Therefore, z_0, z_1, z_2, z_3=z_0, z_1, etc. Therefore, the sequence cycles every three steps. Therefore, z_{n} = z_{n mod3}. Therefore, to find z_{2002}, compute 2002 divided by3, find the remainder, and take that index.

Given that 2002 divided by3 is 667*3=2001, remainder1. Therefore, 2002≡1 mod3. Therefore, z_{2002}=z_1=1 +274i.

**Final Answer**
The value of \( z_{2002} \) is \boxed{1 + 274i}.

Row 1: [1*1 + i*1, 1*i + i*(-i)] = [1 +i, i -i^2] = [1 +i, i +1]

Row 2: [1*1 + (-i)*1, i*1 + (-i)*(-i)] = [1 -i, i +i^2] = [1 -i, i -1]

Wait, wait, in the previous calculation, I think I made a mistake in the bottom right entry. Let me recompute M^2.

Wait, when multiplying the second row of the first matrix [1, -i] with the columns of the second matrix:

For the bottom right entry (second row, second column):

(1st matrix row 2: [1, -i]) multiplied by (second matrix column 2: [i, -i])

So 1*i + (-i)*(-i) =i + (-i)^2 =i + (-1) =i -1. Wait, but that's in the bottom right entry. So M^2 is:

[[1 +i, 1 +i], [1 -i, -1]]

Wait, but previously I had written the bottom right entry as -1, but in reality, it's -1 +0i? Wait, no, let's recompute:

Wait, the second matrix's second row is [1, -i]. So when computing the second row of M^2:

First entry (column 1): [1, -i] * [1,1] =1*1 + (-i)*1 =1 -i

Second entry (column 2): [1, -i] * [i, -i] =1*i + (-i)*(-i) =i +i^2 =i -1

Wait, so the second row of M^2 is [1 -i, i -1]. Therefore, M^2 is:

[ [1 +i, 1 +i],
  [1 -i, i -1] ]

But previously, I had written the bottom right entry as -1, but actually, it's i -1. So that was an error. Therefore, my subsequent calculations for M^3 were incorrect.

<Plan_8>
Based on execution_6.1, execution_7:
Therefore, M^3 is not a scalar matrix, but rather a matrix with entries:

Top left:1 +i +2i(1 -i) =1 +i +2i -2i^2 =1 +3i +2=3 +3i

Top right: (-2 +374i) +2i(1 -2i) =-2 +374i +2i -4i^2 =-2 +376i +4=2 +376i

Bottom left: (-2 -2i) + (-2i)(1 +2i) =-2 -2i -2i -4i^2 =-2 -4i +4=2 -4i

Bottom right:(1 -2i) +2i +374i(1 -2i) =1 -2i +2i +374i -748i^2 =1 +374i +748=749 +374i

Therefore, M^3 = [[3 +3i, 2 +376i], [2 -4i, 749 +374i]]

But this is not a scalar multiple of the identity matrix, so my previous conclusion was incorrect. Therefore, the earlier assumption that M^3 is a scalar matrix was wrong. Therefore, the periodity idea might still be valid, but the calculation of M^3 is more complex.
