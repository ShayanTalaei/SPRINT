Okay, so I need to find the equation of the hyperbola given the two foci, F1 at (10, 2) and F2 at (-16, 2), and the condition that the absolute difference of the distances from any point P on the hyperbola to these foci is 24. Then, I have to express it in the standard form and find the sum h + k + a + b. Let me start by recalling what I know about hyperbolas.

First, the standard form of a hyperbola is either \(\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1\) or \(\frac{(y - k)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(x - h)^2}{b^2} = 1\), depending on whether it opens horizontally or vertically. In this problem, since the foci are given as F1 = (10, 2) and F2 = (-16, 2), both have the same y-coordinate, which is 2.
That means the hyperbola opens left and right, so it's a horizontal hyperbola. Therefore, the standard form will be the first one: \(\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1\).

Next, I need to find the center (h, k) of the hyperbola. The center is the midpoint between the two foci.
To find the midpoint, I can average the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates of the foci.

<prompt_1.1> Find the center (h, k) of the hyperbola using the midpoint of the foci. </prompt_1.1>

Now, the distance between the two foci is 2c. Let me calculate the distance between F1 and F2. Since they have the same y-coordinate, the distance is just the absolute difference of their x-coordinates.

<prompt_1.2> Calculate the distance between the foci and find c. </prompt_1.2>

The definition of a hyperbola is the set of points where the absolute difference of the distances to the two foci is 2a. Wait, the problem states that |PF1 - PF2| = 24. So, that should be equal to 2a. Therefore, 2a = 24, which means a = 12.
So, a is 12. Then, since in hyperbolas, the relationship between a, b, and c is c² = a² + b². So, once I know a and c, I can solve for b.
-----

But let me double-check my steps because sometimes I might mix up the definitions. For hyperbolas, the key definitions are: the difference of distances to the foci is 2a, and the relationship is c² = a² + b². So, given that the difference is 24, that is 2a, so a is 12.

<prompt_1.3> Verify the calculations for a, b, and the standard form of the hyperbola. </prompt_1.3>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
So, the midpoint between (10, 2) and (-16, 2) is ((10 + (-16))/2, (2 + 2)/2). Let's compute that:

For the x-coordinate: (10 + (-16)) = -6, divided by 2 gives -3. The y-coordinate: (2 + 2)/2 = 2. So, the center of the hyperbola is at (h, k) = (-3, 2).
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
F1 is at x = 10, F2 is at x = -16. So, the distance is |10 - (-16)| = |10 + 16| = 26. Therefore, 2c = 26, so c = 13.
</execution_1.2>

<execution_1.3>
Then, the distance between the foci is 2c, which we found to be 26, so c is 13. Then, c² = 13² = 169, a² = 144, so b² = c² - a² = 169 - 144 = 25, so b = 5.
</execution_1.3>
</Execution_1>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1, execution_1.2:
Now, in the standard equation, h and k are the coordinates of the center, which we found to be (-3, 2). So, h = -3 and k = 2.
So far, so good.

Now, as mentioned earlier, for hyperbolas, the relationship between a, b, and c is c² = a² + b². We have c = 13 and a = 12.

<prompt_2.1> Solve for b using the relationship c² = a² + b². </prompt_2.1>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
So, plugging into the equation:

13² = 12² + b²

169 = 144 + b²

Subtract 144 from both sides:

b² = 169 - 144 = 25

Therefore, b = 5. Since b is a length, we take the positive square root.

Now, putting it all together into the standard form of the hyperbola equation:

\(\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1\)

Substituting h = -3, k = 2, a² = 144, and b² = 25:

\(\frac{(x - (-3))^2}{144} - \frac{(y - 2)^2}{25} = 1\)

Simplifying the x-term:

\(\frac{(x + 3)^2}{144} - \frac{(y - 2)^2}{25} = 1\)

Based on execution_2.1:
The problem asks for h + k + a + b. Let's compute each value:

<prompt_3.1> Calculate the sum h + k + a + b. </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
h = -3

k = 2

a = 12 (since a is 12)

b = 5

Adding them together: -3 + 2 + 12 + 5

Let's compute step by step:

-3 + 2 = -1

-1 + 12 = 11

11 + 5 = 16

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
Wait, so the answer is 16? Hmm, let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

<prompt_4.1> Verify the calculations for h, k, a, and b. </prompt_4.1>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
First, center calculation: midpoint between (10,2) and (-16,2). The x-coordinates: (10 + (-16))/2 = (-6)/2 = -3. Y-coordinate: (2 + 2)/2 = 2. Correct. So center (-3,2). So h = -3, k=2.

Then, distance between foci: 10 and -16 on the x-axis. The distance is |10 - (-16)| = 26. So 2c =26, c=13. Correct.

Given that the difference of distances is 24, which is 2a. So 2a=24, a=12. Then, c² = a² + b². 13² = 12² + b². 169 = 144 + b². So b²=25, b=5. Correct.

Then, the sum h + k + a + b: h=-3, k=2, a=12, b=5. So -3 +2 is -1, -1 +12 is 11, 11 +5 is 16.

<Plan_5>
Based on execution_4.1:
But let me check if the standard form is correct. Since it's a horizontal hyperbola, the equation is \(\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1\).
Plugging in h=-3, k=2, a²=144, b²=25. So yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe I should check if the definition is correctly applied. The absolute difference of distances to the foci is 2a. So |PF1 - PF2| = 24 = 2a. Therefore, a =12. That is correct.

Alternatively, sometimes people get confused between 2a and 2c, but in hyperbola, 2a is the distance between the vertices, and 2c is the distance between the foci.
So yes, since the difference of distances is 2a, that's correct.

Another way to check: let's pick a point on the hyperbola and see if it satisfies the equation. For example, the vertex. Since the hyperbola is horizontal, the vertices are a distance a from the center along the x-axis.

<prompt_5.1> Verify the hyperbola equation by checking the vertices and foci. </prompt_5.1>

So, all steps check out. Therefore, the answer is 16.

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
The center is at (-3, 2). So the vertices are at (-3 ± a, 2) = (-3 ±12, 2). So, (9, 2) and (-15, 2).

Let's check the distance between these vertices and the foci. Take the vertex (9,2). The distance to F1 (10,2) is |9 -10| =1, and to F2 (-16,2) is |9 - (-16)| =25. The difference is |25 -1|=24, which matches the given condition. Similarly, for the other vertex (-15,2): distance to F1 (10,2) is |-15 -10|=25, distance to F2 (-16,2) is |-15 - (-16)|=1. The difference is |25 -1|=24. Correct.

Also, let's check the foci. For the vertex (9,2), the distance to each focus should be a ± c. Wait, for hyperbola, the distance from the vertex to the focus is c, but actually, the vertices are at a distance a from the center, and the foci are at a distance c from the center. So, from center (-3,2) to vertex (9,2): distance is |9 - (-3)| =12, which is a. From center to focus is c=13, which matches. So, from vertex (9,2) to focus F1 (10,2): distance is 1, which is c - a =13 -12=1. From vertex (9,2) to focus F2 (-16,2): distance is 25, which is c + a=13 +12=25. Correct.

Therefore, all parameters are correctly calculated.
