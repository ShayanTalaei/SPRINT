<Plan_1>
Okay, let's see. I need to find the ordered triple (p, q, r) such that the polynomial x³ - 3x² + 4x - 1 is a factor of x⁹ + p x⁶ + q x³ + r. Hmm, so if x³ - 3x² + 4x - 1 is a factor of that degree 9 polynomial, then the roots of x³ - 3x² + 4x - 1 should also be roots of x⁹ + p x⁶ + q x³ + r. That means if I take any root α of x³ - 3x² + 4x - 1, then substituting α into the degree 9 polynomial should give zero: α⁹ + p α⁶ + q α³ + r = 0. So maybe I can use this relationship to express higher powers of α in terms of lower powers, using the original cubic equation.

Let me write that down. Let α be a root of x³ - 3x² + 4x - 1, so α³ - 3α² + 4α - 1 = 0. Therefore, α³ = 3α² - 4α + 1. Maybe I can use this to reduce α⁹, α⁶, etc.

<prompt_1.1> Use the above plan to reduce α⁹, α⁶, and α³ in terms of α², α, and constants. </prompt_1.1>

Alternatively, maybe there's another approach. Since the polynomial x³ - 3x² + 4x - 1 divides x⁹ + p x⁶ + q x³ + r, then there exists a polynomial Q(x) such that x⁹ + p x⁶ + q x³ + r = (x³ - 3x² + 4x - 1) Q(x). Then, if we perform the division, the remainder should be zero. But polynomial division might be tedious here, but maybe we can use polynomial remainder theorem.

Alternatively, since x³ - 3x² + 4x - 1 is a cubic polynomial, the remainder when dividing by it would be a quadratic or lower. But in this case, the dividend is x⁹ + p x⁶ + q x³ + r, which is a degree 9 polynomial, and the divisor is degree 3, so the quotient would be degree 6, which is Q(x). But perhaps using the roots approach is better.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use polynomial equivalence. Since x⁹ + p x⁶ + q x³ + r is divisible by x³ - 3x² + 4x - 1, then we can write x⁹ + p x⁶ + q x³ + r = (x³ - 3x² + 4x - 1)(x⁶ + a x⁵ + b x⁴ + c x³ + d x² + e x + f). Then, expanding the right-hand side and equating coefficients with the left-hand side. But that might be a longer approach, but perhaps it's doable.

Let me try that.

Let me denote the divisor as D(x) = x³ - 3x² + 4x - 1, and the quotient as Q(x) = x⁶ + a x⁵ + b x⁴ + c x³ + d x² + e x + f. Then, multiplying D(x) and Q(x):

Let me compute α⁶ first. Since α³ = 3α² - 4α + 1, then α⁶ = (α³)² = (3α² - 4α + 1)². Let me expand that:

(3α² - 4α + 1)² = 9α⁴ - 24α³ + (16 + 6)α² - 8α + 1. Wait, let me check that step by step.

Wait, (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc. So here, a = 3α², b = -4α, c = 1.

So:

(3α²)² + (-4α)² + (1)² + 2*(3α²)*(-4α) + 2*(3α²)*1 + 2*(-4α)*1

= 9α⁴ + 16α² + 1 + 2*(-12α³) + 6α² + (-8α)

= 9α⁴ + 16α² + 1 - 24α³ + 6α² - 8α

Combine like terms:

9α⁴ -24α³ + (16α² + 6α²) + (-8α) + 1

= 9α⁴ -24α³ + 22α² -8α +1

But now, we still have α⁴ terms. Let's express α⁴ in terms of lower powers. Since α³ = 3α² -4α +1, multiply both sides by α: α⁴ = 3α³ -4α² + α. But we can substitute α³ again:

α⁴ = 3*(3α² -4α +1) -4α² + α = 9α² -12α +3 -4α² + α = (9α² -4α²) + (-12α + α) +3 = 5α² -11α +3

So substituting back into α⁶:

α⁶ = 9α⁴ -24α³ +22α² -8α +1 = 9*(5α² -11α +3) -24*(3α² -4α +1) +22α² -8α +1

Let me compute each term:

9*(5α² -11α +3) = 45α² -99α +27

-24*(3α² -4α +1) = -72α² +96α -24

Adding the remaining terms: +22α² -8α +1

Now combine all terms:

45α² -99α +27 -72α² +96α -24 +22α² -8α +1

Combine like terms:

(45α² -72α² +22α²) + (-99α +96α -8α) + (27 -24 +1)

Calculates to:

(45 -72 +22)α² + (-99 +96 -8)α + (27 -24 +1)

Which is:

(-7α²) + (-11α) + 4

So α⁶ = -7α² -11α +4.

Hmm, that's interesting. Let's keep that in mind.

Now, let's compute α⁹. Since α⁹ = α³ * α⁶. We already know α³ = 3α² -4α +1 and α⁶ = -7α² -11α +4. So multiply these two:

Alternatively, maybe another method. Since the polynomial x⁹ + p x⁶ + q x³ + r is divisible by x³ -3x² +4x -1, then we can perform polynomial division, but that might be tedious. Alternatively, note that if we let y = x³, then the given polynomial is y³ + p y² + q y + r. But the divisor polynomial is x³ -3x² +4x -1. Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Wait, but if we consider substituting x³ = 3x² -4x +1, then perhaps we can express x⁹ in terms of lower degrees.

First term: x³ * x⁶ = x⁹.

Next, x³ * a x⁵ = a x⁸.

x³ * b x⁴ = b x⁷.

x³ * c x³ = c x⁶.

x³ * d x² = d x⁵.

x³ * e x = e x⁴.

x³ * f = f x³.

Then, -3x² * x⁶ = -3 x⁸.

-3x² * a x⁵ = -3a x⁷.

-3x² * b x⁴ = -3b x⁶.

-3x² * c x³ = -3c x⁵.

-3x² * d x² = -3d x⁴.

-3x² * e x = -3e x³.

-3x² * f = -3f x².

Then, 4x * x⁶ = 4 x⁷.

4x * a x⁵ = 4a x⁶.

4x * b x⁴ = 4b x⁵.

4x * c x³ = 4c x⁴.

4x * d x² = 4d x³.

4x * e x = 4e x².

4x * f = 4f x.

Finally, -1 * x⁶ = -1 x⁶.

-1 * a x⁵ = -a x⁵.

-1 * b x⁴ = -b x⁴.

-1 * c x³ = -c x³.

-1 * d x² = -d x².

-1 * e x = -e x.

-1 * f = -f.

Now, let's collect like terms:

x⁹ term: 1 x⁹.

x⁸ terms: a x⁸ - 3 x⁸ = (a - 3) x⁸.

x⁷ terms: b x⁷ - 3a x⁷ + 4 x⁷ = (b - 3a + 4) x⁷.

x⁶ terms: c x⁶ - 3b x⁶ + 4a x⁶ - 1 x⁶ = (c - 3b + 4a - 1) x⁶.

x⁵ terms: d x⁵ - 3c x⁵ + 4b x⁵ - a x⁵ = (d - 3c + 4b - a) x⁵.

x⁴ terms: e x⁴ - 3d x⁴ + 4c x⁴ - b x⁴ = (e - 3d + 4c - b) x⁴.

x³ terms: f x³ - 3e x³ + 4d x³ - c x³ = (f - 3e + 4d - c) x³.

x² terms: -3f x² + 4e x² - d x² = (-3f + 4e - d) x².

x terms: 4f x - e x = (4f - e) x.

Constant term: -f.

Now, according to the original polynomial, which is x⁹ + p x⁶ + q x³ + r. So, all coefficients except x⁹, x⁶, x³, and the constant term (which is r) must be zero. Therefore, we can set up equations by equating the coefficients:

For x⁹: 1 (matches, so no equation here).

For x⁸: a - 3 = 0 ⇒ a = 3.

For x⁷: b - 3a + 4 = 0.

For x⁶: c - 3b + 4a - 1 = p.

For x⁵: d - 3c + 4b - a = 0.

For x⁴: e - 3d + 4c - b = 0.

For x³: f - 3e + 4d - c = q.

For x²: -3f + 4e - d = 0.

For x: 4f - e = 0.

For constant term: -f = r.

So, we have a system of equations:

1. a = 3.

2. b - 3a + 4 = 0.

3. c - 3b + 4a - 1 = p.

4. d - 3c + 4b - a = 0.

5. e - 3d + 4c - b = 0.

6. f - 3e + 4d - c = q.

7. -3f + 4e - d = 0.

8. 4f - e = 0.

9. -f = r.

Let's solve these equations step by step.

From equation 1: a = 3.

Plug a = 3 into equation 2:

b - 3*3 + 4 = 0 ⇒ b - 9 + 4 = 0 ⇒ b - 5 = 0 ⇒ b = 5.

Now, equation 3: c - 3b + 4a - 1 = p. Substitute a=3, b=5:

c - 3*5 + 4*3 -1 = p ⇒ c -15 +12 -1 = p ⇒ c -4 = p. So p = c -4. We need to find c.

Equation 4: d -3c +4b -a =0. Substitute b=5, a=3:

d -3c +4*5 -3 =0 ⇒ d -3c +20 -3 =0 ⇒ d -3c +17 =0 ⇒ d =3c -17.

Equation 5: e -3d +4c -b =0. Substitute d=3c -17, b=5:

e -3*(3c -17) +4c -5 =0 ⇒ e -9c +51 +4c -5 =0 ⇒ e -5c +46 =0 ⇒ e =5c -46.

Equation 6: f -3e +4d -c =q. Substitute e=5c -46, d=3c -17:

f -3*(5c -46) +4*(3c -17) -c =q ⇒ f -15c +138 +12c -68 -c =q ⇒ f -4c +70 =q. So q = f -4c. Need to find f.

Equation 7: -3f +4e -d =0. Substitute e=5c -46, d=3c -17:

-3f +4*(5c -46) - (3c -17) =0 ⇒ -3f +20c -184 -3c +17 =0 ⇒ -3f +17c -167 =0 ⇒ -3f = -17c +167 ⇒ 3f =17c -167 ⇒ f=(17c -167)/3.

Equation 8:4f -e =0. Substitute e=5c -46, f=(17c -167)/3:

4*(17c -167)/3 - (5c -46) =0 ⇒ (68c -668)/3 -5c +46 =0.

Multiply all terms by 3 to eliminate denominator:

68c -668 -15c +138 =0 ⇒ (68c -15c) + (-668 +138) =0 ⇒53c -530 =0 ⇒53c=530 ⇒c=10.

So c=10. Now, let's backtrack to find other variables.

From equation 1: a=3.

Equation 2: b=5.

Equation 3: p = c -4 =10 -4=6.

Equation 4: d=3c -17=3*10 -17=30 -17=13.

Equation 5: e=5c -46=5*10 -46=50 -46=4.

Equation 6: f=(17c -167)/3=(17*10 -167)/3=(170 -167)/3=3/3=1.

Equation 7: Check with equation 7: -3f +4e -d = -3*1 +4*4 -13= -3 +16 -13=0. Correct.

Equation 8: 4f -e=4*1 -4=0. Correct.

Equation 9: r= -f= -1.

Equation 6: q = f -4c=1 -4*10=1 -40= -39.

So p=6, q=-39, r=-1. Therefore, the ordered triple is (6, -39, -1).

Based on execution_1.1:
Let me try that.

First, let's write down the divisor D(x) = x³ - 3x² + 4x - 1.
So when we multiply D(x) by Q(x), we should get x⁹ + p x⁶ + q x³ + r. Let's perform the multiplication step by step.

</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
First, Q(x) is a degree 6 polynomial: x⁶ + a x⁵ + b x⁴ + c x³ + d x² + e x + f. Let's denote each term:

D(x) * Q(x) = (x³ - 3x² + 4x -1)(x⁶ + a x⁵ + b x⁴ + c x³ + d x² + e x + f).

Let's multiply each term in D(x) with each term in Q(x):

First, x³ * Q(x) = x³*(x⁶ + a x⁵ + b x⁴ + c x³ + d x² + e x + f) = x⁹ + a x⁸ + b x⁷ + c x⁶ + d x⁵ + e x⁴ + f x³.

Next, -3x² * Q(x) = -3x²*(x⁶ + a x⁵ + b x⁴ + c x³ + d x² + e x + f) = -3x⁸ -3a x⁷ -3b x⁶ -3c x⁵ -3d x⁴ -3e x³ -3f x².

Then, 4x * Q(x) = 4x*(x⁶ + a x⁵ + b x⁴ + c x³ + d x² + e x + f) = 4x⁷ +4a x⁶ +4b x⁵ +4c x⁴ +4d x³ +4e x² +4f x.

Finally, -1 * Q(x) = -1*(x⁶ + a x⁵ + b x⁴ + c x³ + d x² + e x + f) = -x⁶ -a x⁵ -b x⁴ -c x³ -d x² -e x -f.

x² terms: -3f x² +4e x² -d x² = (-3f +4e -d)x².

x terms: 4f x -e x = (4f -e)x.

Constant term: -f.

Now, according to the original polynomial, which is x⁹ + p x⁶ + q x³ + r. So all coefficients except x⁹, x⁶, x³, and the constant term (which is r) must be zero. Therefore, we can set up equations by equating the coefficients:

For x⁹: coefficient is 1, which matches.

For x⁸: a - 3 = 0 ⇒ a = 3.

For x⁷: b - 3a + 4 = 0.

For x⁶: c - 3b + 4a - 1 = p.

For x⁵: d - 3c + 4b - a = 0.

For x⁴: e - 3d + 4c - b = 0.

For x³: f - 3e + 4d - c = q.

For x²: -3f + 4e - d = 0.

For x: 4f - e = 0.

For constant term: -f = r.

So, we have a system of equations:

1. a = 3.

2. b - 3a + 4 = 0.

Suppose α is a root of x³ -3x² +4x -1=0. Then, α³=3α² -4α +1, α⁶= -7α² -11α +4, α⁹=3α⁶ -4α³ +1. Let's compute α⁹ + p α⁶ + q α³ + r.

Substitute p=6, q=-39, r=-1:

α⁹ +6 α⁶ -39 α³ -1.

But α⁹=3α⁶ -4α³ +1 (from earlier). So substituting:

(3α⁶ -4α³ +1) +6α⁶ -39α³ -1 = (3α⁶ +6α⁶) + (-4α³ -39α³) + (1 -1) =9α⁶ -43α³. But from earlier, α³=3α² -4α +1, so α⁶= -7α² -11α +4. Therefore, substitute:

9*(-7α² -11α +4) -43*(3α² -4α +1) = (-63α² -99α +36) + (-129α² +172α -43) = (-63 -129)α² + (-99 +172)α + (36 -43) = (-192α²) +73α -7.

Wait, when we divided α⁹ by α³ -3α² +4α -1, we found α⁹=3α⁶ -4α³ +1. Then substituting into the polynomial x⁹ +6x⁶ -39x³ -1, we get 3α⁶ -4α³ +1 +6α⁶ -39α³ -1 =9α⁶ -43α³. Then substituting α³=3α² -4α +1 and α⁶=-7α² -11α +4.

Calculating 9α⁶:9*(-7α² -11α +4)= -63α² -99α +36.

Calculating -43α³: -43*(3α² -4α +1)= -129α² +172α -43.

Adding them together: (-63α² -99α +36) + (-129α² +172α -43) = (-63 -129)α² + (-99 +172)α + (36 -43) = -192α² +73α -7.

Hmm, which is not zero. But according to the problem statement, x⁹ +px⁶ +qx³ +r should be divisible by the cubic polynomial, meaning that when divided, the remainder should be zero. So either there's an error in the calculation, or perhaps a miscalculation in the coefficients.

Wait, but according to the earlier polynomial division approach, we found p=6, q=-39, r=-1. However, substituting back into the equation gives a non-zero remainder. Therefore, there must be an error in either the polynomial division approach or the coefficient matching approach.

Earlier, we reduced x⁹ +px⁶ +qx³ +r modulo x³ -3x² +4x -1 and found the remainder as -x⁵ +x⁴ - (p+1)x³ + (x² -p)x -1. Then setting this equal to zero for divisibility, leading to the equations:

-x⁵ +x⁴ - (p+1)x³ + (x² -p)x -1 =0. But since the cubic polynomial divides the degree 9 polynomial, the remainder must be zero for all x, which would require all coefficients to be zero. However, the remainder has terms up to x⁵, which contradicts the original cubic divisor. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the reduction process.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in how we perform the division. Let me re-examine the polynomial division approach.

If the cubic polynomial D(x) divides the degree 9 polynomial, then the division should result in a quotient Q(x) of degree 6 and remainder zero. Therefore, when we write x⁹ +px⁶ +qx³ +r = D(x) * Q(x), then substituting α (a root of D(x)) into the left-hand side gives zero. Therefore, the evaluation at α must be zero, leading to α⁹ +p α⁶ +q α³ +r =0. Since α³ =3α² -4α +1, we can express higher powers of α in terms of lower degrees, leading to the conclusion that the remainder must be zero. Therefore, the coefficients derived from the remainder must be zero, leading to p=6, q=-39, r=-1. However, substituting back into the equation gives a non-zero value, which suggests an error in the process.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the reduction steps. Let me re-examine the reduction of α⁹.

Starting over:

Given α³ =3α² -4α +1.

Compute α⁶:

α⁶ = (α³)^2 = (3α² -4α +1)^2.

Expanding this:

=9α⁴ -24α³ + (16 +6)α² -8α +1.

Wait, earlier I had 9α⁴ -24α³ +22α² -8α +1. Let me verify:

(3α² -4α +1)^2 = 9α⁴ + (-4α)^2 +1^2 + 2*(3α²)(-4α) + 2*(3α²)(1) + 2*(-4α)(1).

Wait, no, actually, (a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc. So:

(3α²)^2 =9α⁴.

(-4α)^2=16α².

1^2=1.

Cross terms:

2*(3α²)*(-4α)= -24α³.

2*(3α²)*1=6α².

2*(-4α)*1= -8α.

Therefore, α⁶=9α⁴ -24α³ +6α² -8α +1.

But we need to express α⁴ in terms of lower degrees. Since α³=3α² -4α +1, multiply both sides by α: α⁴=3α³ -4α² +α.

Substitute α⁴:

α⁶=9*(3α³ -4α² +α) -24α³ +6α² -8α +1.

=27α³ -36α² +9α -24α³ +6α² -8α +1.

Combine like terms:

(27α³ -24α³)=3α³.

(-36α² +6α²)= -30α².

(9α -8α)=α.

+1.

Thus, α⁶=3α³ -30α² +α +1.

Now, express α³ again:

α³=3α² -4α +1.

Substitute into α⁶:

α⁶=3*(3α² -4α +1) -30α² +α +1.

=9α² -12α +3 -30α² +α +1.

Combine like terms:

(9α² -30α²)= -21α².

(-12α +α)= -11α.

(3 +1)=4.

Therefore, α⁶= -21α² -11α +4. This matches the earlier result.

Now, compute α⁹. Since α⁹=α³ * α⁶.

α³=3α² -4α +1.

α⁶= -21α² -11α +4.

Multiply them:

α⁹=(3α² -4α +1)*(-21α² -11α +4).

Multiply term by term:

First, 3α² * (-21α²) = -63α⁴.

3α²*(-11α) = -33α³.

3α²*4=12α².

-4α*(-21α²)=84α³.

-4α*(-11α)=44α².

-4α*4= -16α.

1*(-21α²)= -21α².

1*(-11α)= -11α.

1*4=4.

So combining:

-63α⁴ -33α³ +12α² +84α³ +44α² -16α -21α² -11α +4.

Combine like terms:

α⁴ term: -63α⁴.

α³ terms: (-33 +84)α³=51α³.

α² terms: (12 +44 -21)α²=35α².

α terms: (-16 -11)α= -27α.

Constants: +4.

Therefore, α⁹= -63α⁴ +51α³ +35α² -27α +4.

Again, substitute α⁴=3α³ -4α² +α:

α⁹= -63*(3α³ -4α² +α) +51α³ +35α² -27α +4.

= -189α³ +252α² -63α +51α³ +35α² -27α +4.

Combine like terms:

α³: (-189 +51)= -138α³.

α²:252 +35=287α².

α: -63α -27α= -90α.

Constants: +4.

Thus, α⁹= -138α³ +287α² -90α +4.

Now, substitute into the polynomial x⁹ +p x⁶ +q x³ +r:

α⁹ +p α⁶ +q α³ +r= (-138α³ +287α² -90α +4) +p*(-21α² -11α +4) +q*(3α² -4α +1) +r.

Expand each term:

-138α³ +287α² -90α +4 -21p α² -11p α +4p +3q α² -4q α +q +r.

Combine like terms:

α³ term: -138α³.

α² terms: 287α² -21p α² +3q α².

α terms: -90α -11p α -4q α.

Constants: 4 +4p +q +r.

Set this equal to zero for all α, so each coefficient must be zero:

α³ term: -138 =0. Wait, that's impossible. Wait, no, actually, the entire expression must be zero, so each coefficient must be zero. But α³, α², α, and constants must each have coefficients zero. However, the α³ term here is -138α³. How is that possible?

Wait a minute, this suggests that there's a mistake in the calculation because if we substitute α into the polynomial x⁹ +p x⁶ +q x³ +r, we should get zero, but according to this, we have -138α³ + ... =0. But α³ is not zero. Therefore, there must be a miscalculation here.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, the polynomial x⁹ +p x⁶ +q x³ +r is divisible by the cubic polynomial, which means that when we substitute α into the polynomial, it should equal zero. However, according to our calculation, substituting α gives -138α³ + ... =0, which implies that -138α³ + ... =0. But since α³ is not zero, this can only hold if the coefficients of α³, α², α, and constants are all zero. Therefore, we can set up equations by equating the coefficients of each power of α to zero.

<Execution_9>
<execution_9.1>
α³ term: -138 +0 (from other terms, since α³ is only present in the original α⁹ term). Wait, but in the substitution, we have α³ from α⁹, but the other terms (p α⁶, q α³) might not introduce α³. Wait, let me check:

Wait, α⁶ we expressed in terms of α², α, and constants. So when we substitute p α⁶, it becomes p*(-21α² -11α +4). Similarly, q α³ is q*(3α² -4α +1). So the only α³ term is from the original α⁹, which is -138α³. Therefore, to have the entire expression equal zero, the coefficient of α³ must be zero. Therefore:

-138 =0. Wait, that's impossible. This suggests an error in the calculation.

Wait, this can't be right. There must be a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the steps again.

<execution_10.1>
Given α³ =3α² -4α +1.

Compute α⁶ = (α³)^2 = (3α² -4α +1)^2.

Expanding this:

=9α⁴ +16α² +1 + 2*(3α²)(-4α) + 2*(3α²)(1) + 2*(-4α)(1).

=9α⁴ +16α² +1 -24α³ +6α² -8α.

Combine like terms:

9α⁴ -24α³ + (16α² +6α²)=22α² -8α +1.

Thus, α⁶=9α⁴ -24α³ +22α² -8α +1.

Then, express α⁴ in terms of lower degrees: α⁴=3α³ -4α² +α.

Substitute into α⁶:

α⁶=9*(3α³ -4α² +α) -24α³ +22α² -8α +1.

=27α³ -36α² +9α -24α³ +22α² -8α +1.

Combine like terms:

(27α³ -24α³)=3α³.

(-36α² +22α²)= -14α².

(9α -8α)=α.

+1.

Therefore, α⁶=3α³ -14α² +α +1. This corrects the earlier mistake where α⁶ was miscalculated as -7α² -11α +4. The correct expression is α⁶=3α³ -14α² +α +1.

Now, compute α⁹=α³ * α⁶.

α³=3α² -4α +1.

α⁶=3α³ -14α² +α +1.

Multiply them:

α³*α⁶= (3α² -4α +1)*(3α³ -14α² +α +1).

Let's expand this step by step:

First, multiply 3α² by each term in α⁶:

3α² *3α³=9α⁵.

3α²*(-14α²)= -42α⁴.

3α²*α=3α³.

3α²*1=3α².

Next, multiply -4α by each term in α⁶:

-4α*3α³= -12α⁴.

-4α*(-14α²)=56α³.

-4α*α= -4α².

-4α*1= -4α.

Next, multiply 1 by each term in α⁶:

1*3α³=3α³.

1*(-14α²)= -14α².

1*α=α.

1*1=1.

Now, combine all terms:

9α⁵ -42α⁴ +3α³ +3α² -12α⁴ +56α³ -4α² -4α +3α³ -14α² +α +1.

Combine like terms:

α⁵:9α⁵.

α⁴: -42α⁴ -12α⁴= -54α⁴.

α³:3α³ +56α³ +3α³=62α³.

α²:3α² -4α² -14α²= -15α².

α: -4α +α= -3α.

Constants: +1.

So, α⁹=9α⁵ -54α⁴ +62α³ -15α² -3α +1.

Now, substitute α⁵ and α⁴:

α⁵=3α⁴ -4α³ +α².

α⁴=3α³ -4α² +α.

Substitute into α⁹:

9*(3α⁴ -4α³ +α²) -54*(3α³ -4α² +α) +62α³ -15α² -3α +1.

Calculate each part:

First term:9*(3α⁴ -4α³ +α²)=27α⁴ -36α³ +9α².

Second term:-54*(3α³ -4α² +α)= -162α³ +216α² -54α.

Third term:62α³.

Fourth term:-15α².

Fifth term:-3α.

Sixth term:+1.

Combine all terms:

27α⁴ -36α³ +9α² -162α³ +216α² -54α +62α³ -15α² -3α +1.

Combine like terms:

α⁴:27α⁴.

α³:-36α³ -162α³ +62α³= (-36 -162 +62)α³= (-136)α³.

α²:9α² +216α² -15α²= (9 +216 -15)α²=210α².

α:-54α -3α= -57α.

Constants:+1.

Therefore, α⁹=27α⁴ -136α³ +210α² -57α +1.

Now, substitute α⁴=3α³ -4α² +α:

α⁹=27*(3α³ -4α² +α) -136α³ +210α² -57α +1.

Calculate:

=81α³ -108α² +27α -136α³ +210α² -57α +1.

Combine like terms:

α³:81α³ -136α³= -55α³.

α²:-108α² +210α²=102α².

α:27α -57α= -30α.

Constants:+1.

Thus, α⁹= -55α³ +102α² -30α +1.

Therefore, substituting into the polynomial x⁹ +p x⁶ +q x³ +r:

α⁹ +p α⁶ +q α³ +r= (-55α³ +102α² -30α +1) +p*(3α³ -14α² +α +1) +q*(3α² -4α +1) +r.

Expand each term:

= -55α³ +102α² -30α +1 +3p α³ -14p α² +p α +p +3q α² -4q α +q +r.

Combine like terms:

α³ terms: (-55 +3p)α³.

α² terms: (102 -14p +3q)α².

α terms: (-30 +p -4q)α.

Constants: (1 +p +q +r).

Since this must equal zero for all α, each coefficient must be zero:

1. α³ term: -55 +3p =0 ⇒3p=55 ⇒p=55/3. But p must be an integer. This is a problem. This suggests an error in the calculation.

Wait, this can't be right. The problem states that the polynomial is divisible by x³ -3x² +4x -1, so the remainder should be zero, which would require these coefficients to be zero. However, getting p=55/3 is not possible since p must be an integer. Therefore, there must be an error in the calculation of α⁹.

This indicates a miscalculation in the expansion of α⁹. Let's retrace the steps:
