Okay, so I need to find the smallest positive real number C such that for any two-dimensional vector v, the inequality ||Mv|| ≤ C||v|| holds, where M is the matrix [[2, 3], [0, -2]]. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that when dealing with matrix norms, the operator norm of a matrix is the smallest number C such that the inequality holds for all vectors v. The operator norm is defined as the maximum of ||Mv|| over all vectors v with ||v|| = 1. So essentially, C is the maximum singular value of the matrix M. Therefore, I need to compute the singular values of M and find the largest one, which will be our C.

Singular values are the square roots of the eigenvalues of M^T M. So, maybe I should compute M transpose multiplied by M and then find its eigenvalues.

Let me start by computing M^T.
The original matrix M is:

[2  3]
[0 -2]

So, the transpose of M, which is M^T, will be:

[2  0]
[3 -2]

Now, let's compute M^T multiplied by M.

Alternatively, another way to think about this problem is that the operator norm (the maximum stretching factor of the matrix) for a 2x2 matrix can sometimes be found by considering the eigenvalues. However, since M is not necessarily a normal matrix (i.e., M^T M ≠ M M^T ), the operator norm isn't simply the maximum of the absolute values of the eigenvalues. Instead, it's the square root of the maximum eigenvalue of M^T M, as we computed.

Let me just verify with another vector. Suppose we take a vector not aligned with the eigenvectors.

Multiplying M^T and M:

First row of M^T times first column of M: (2)(2) + (0)(0) = 4 + 0 = 4.

First row of M^T times second column of M: (2)(3) + (0)(-2) = 6 + 0 = 6.

Second row of M^T times first column of M: (3)(2) + (-2)(0) = 6 + 0 = 6.

Second row of M^T times second column of M: (3)(3) + (-2)(-2) = 9 + 4 = 13.

So, M^T M is:

[4  6]
[6 13]

Let's take v = [1, 1]^T. Then ||v|| = sqrt(1 + 1) = sqrt(2). Let's compute Mv:

Mv = [2*1 + 3*1, 0*1 + (-2)*1]^T = [5, -2]^T. The norm of Mv is sqrt(25 + 4) = sqrt(29) ≈ 5.385. Then the ratio ||Mv|| / ||v|| ≈ 5.385 / 1.414 ≈ 3.818, which is less than 4. So that's consistent with C=4 being an upper bound. 

Another test: take v = [3, -4]^T. Then ||v|| = 5. Compute Mv: [2*3 + 3*(-4), 0*3 + (-2)*(-4)] = [6 -12, 0 + 8] = [-6, 8]^T. Norm of Mv is sqrt(36 + 64) = sqrt(100) = 10. Then 10 / 5 = 2, which is less than 4. Hmm, so in this case, the ratio is 2.

Let me denote this matrix as A = M^T M:

[4  6]
[6 13]

Now, to find the eigenvalues of A, we need to solve the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0.

So, the determinant of [[4 - λ, 6], [6, 13 - λ]] should be zero.

Calculating the determinant: (4 - λ)(13 - λ) - 36 = 0.

Expanding the product: (4)(13) - 4λ - 13λ + λ² - 36 = 0.

Which is: 52 - 17λ + λ² - 36 = 0.

Simplify: λ² -17λ + 16 = 0.

Wait, 52 - 36 is 16, so the equation is λ² -17λ +16 = 0.

Then ||v|| = 1. Mv = [2*0 + 3*1, 0*0 + (-2)*1]^T = [3, -2]^T. The norm of Mv is sqrt(9 + 4) = sqrt(13) ≈ 3.605, which is less than 4. So again, less than C=4.

Another example: v = [1, 0]^T. Then ||v|| = 1. Mv = [2*1 + 3*0, 0*1 + (-2)*0]^T = [2, 0]^T. Norm is 2, which is less than 4. 

Wait, but the norm of M itself as a linear transformation is the maximum stretching it can do. Since the eigenvalues of M are 2 and -2, but the operator norm isn't just the maximum absolute eigenvalue because M isn't normal. So in this case, the operator norm is indeed 4, as we found through the singular values.

Using the quadratic formula: λ = [17 ± sqrt(17² - 4*1*16)] / 2.

Calculating discriminant: 289 - 64 = 225.

sqrt(225) = 15. So, λ = [17 ±15]/2.

Thus, the eigenvalues are (17 +15)/2 = 32/2 = 16, and (17 -15)/2 = 2/2 = 1.

So the eigenvalues of A are 16 and 1.

||Mv||² / ||v||² = ( (2x + 3y)^2 + (0x -2y)^2 ) / (x² + y²)

Expanding the numerator: (4x² + 12xy + 9y²) + 4y² = 4x² +12xy +13y²

So the ratio squared is (4x² +12xy +13y²)/(x² + y²). Let me denote t = y/x, assuming x ≠ 0. Then substituting y = tx, the ratio squared becomes:

(4x² +12x*(tx) +13*(tx)^2 ) / (x² + (tx)^2 ) = (4 +12t +13t²)/(1 + t²)

So now we have a function f(t) = (13t² +12t +4)/(1 + t²). To find the maximum of this function over all real t, which will correspond to the square of the operator norm. Then, taking the square root will give us C.

So let's find the maximum of f(t). To do this, take derivative f’(t), set to zero.

Compute derivative using quotient rule:

f’(t) = [ (26t +12)(1 + t²) - (13t² +12t +4)(2t) ] / (1 + t²)^2

Simplify numerator:

First term: (26t +12)(1 + t²) = 26t(1) +26t(t²) +12(1) +12(t²) = 26t +26t³ +12 +12t²

Second term: - (13t² +12t +4)(2t) = -26t³ -24t² -8t

So combining both terms:

26t +26t³ +12 +12t² -26t³ -24t² -8t

Simplify:

26t³ -26t³ +12t² -24t² +26t -8t +12

Which is:

0t³ -12t² +18t +12

Set numerator equal to zero:

-12t² +18t +12 = 0

Multiply both sides by -1:

12t² -18t -12 = 0

Divide both sides by 6:

2t² -3t -2 = 0

Solve quadratic equation:

t = [3 ± sqrt(9 +16)] /4 = [3 ± sqrt(25)] /4 = [3 ±5]/4

So solutions are t = (3 +5)/4 = 8/4 = 2, and t = (3 -5)/4 = (-2)/4 = -0.5

So critical points at t = 2 and t = -0.5. Now evaluate f(t) at these points.

First, t = 2:

f(2) = (13*(4) +12*2 +4)/(1 +4) = (52 +24 +4)/5 = 80/5 =16

Then t = -0.5:

f(-0.5) = (13*(0.25) +12*(-0.5) +4)/(1 +0.25) = (3.25 -6 +4)/1.25 = (1.25)/1.25 =1

So the maximum of f(t) is 16 at t=2, so the maximum of ||Mv||² / ||v||² is 16, hence the maximum ||Mv|| / ||v|| is sqrt(16)=4. Therefore, C=4. 

This matches our earlier result from computing singular values. Therefore, the smallest positive real number C is indeed 4.

Based on execution_3.1:
Therefore, the eigenvalues of M^T M are 16 and 1. The singular values of M are the square roots of these eigenvalues, so sqrt(16) = 4 and sqrt(1) = 1. Therefore, the largest singular value is 4, which means the operator norm C is 4. 

To confirm, let's check if there's a vector v such that ||Mv|| = 4||v||. If the singular value is indeed 4, then there should be a vector achieving this ratio.

Singular vectors corresponding to the singular value 4 would be the eigenvectors of M^T M with eigenvalue 16.

<prompt_4.1> Confirm the operator norm by finding a vector that achieves the ratio ||Mv|| = 4||v||. </prompt_4.1>
