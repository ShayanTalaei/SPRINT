Okay, let's see. Hillary has 11 coins, and they're all dimes and nickels. The total value is 75 cents. I need to find out how many nickels she has. Hmm, let's start by breaking down the problem.

<prompt_1.1> Set up the equations based on the problem statement where Hillary has 11 coins of dimes and nickels totaling 75 cents. </prompt_1.1>

First, let's denote the number of dimes as D and the number of nickels as N. Since all the coins are either dimes or nickels, the total number of coins is D + N. According to the problem, this sum is 11. So, that gives me the first equation: D + N = 11.

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Now, the total value of the coins is 75 cents. Dimes are worth 10 cents each, and nickels are 5 cents each. So, the total value from the dimes would be 10D cents, and the total value from the nickels would be 5N cents. Adding those together should equal 75 cents.
So, the second equation is 10D + 5N = 75.

Now, I have a system of two equations:

1. D + N = 11
2. 10D + 5N = 75

I need to solve this system to find the value of N, the number of nickels.

Let me think about how to solve this. I can use substitution or elimination. Maybe substitution is easier here.

Alternatively, maybe I can try plugging in numbers. If all 11 coins were dimes, that would be 110 cents. But she has 75 cents, which is 35 cents less. Each nickel is worth 5 cents, and each dime is 10 cents.
Wait, if I replace a dime with a nickel, the total value decreases by 5 cents. Because 10 - 5 = 5. So, each time I replace a dime with a nickel, the total goes down by 5 cents. The difference between 11 dimes (110) and actual total (75) is 35 cents. So, 35 divided by 5 is 7. So, she must have 7 nickels and 4 dimes.

Another way: Let's say she has N nickels and (11 - N) dimes. Then total value is 5N + 10(11 - N) = 75. Let's compute that:

<prompt_2.2> Use an alternative method by assuming N nickels and (11 - N) dimes to find the number of nickels. </prompt_2.2>

Maybe another approach. Suppose all coins are nickels. Then 11 nickels would be 55 cents. But the total is 75, which is 20 cents more. Each dime is 5 cents more than a nickel.
So, replacing a nickel with a dime adds 5 cents. The difference is 20 cents, so 20 /5 =4. So, replace 4 nickels with dimes. Hence, 7 nickels and 4 dimes.

All methods lead to 7 nickels. So, that must be the answer.

<execution_2.1>
From the first equation, D = 11 - N. Then substitute this into the second equation.

So, replacing D in the second equation with (11 - N):

10*(11 - N) + 5N = 75

Let me compute that step by step. 10*11 is 110, and 10*(-N) is -10N. Then plus 5N. So:

110 - 10N + 5N = 75

Combine like terms: -10N + 5N is -5N. So:

110 - 5N = 75

Now, subtract 110 from both sides:

-5N = 75 - 110

75 - 110 is -35, so:

-5N = -35

Divide both sides by -5:

N = (-35)/(-5) = 7

So, N = 7. That means there are 7 nickels. Then, since D + N = 11, D = 11 - 7 = 4. So, 4 dimes.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
5N + 110 -10N = 75

Combine like terms:

-5N + 110 = 75

Subtract 110 from both sides:

-5N = -35

Divide both sides by -5:

N = 7

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Let me check if this makes sense.
7 nickels would be 7*5 = 35 cents, and 4 dimes would be 4*10 = 40 cents. 35 + 40 = 75 cents, which matches the total. And 7 + 4 = 11 coins.

Therefore, the answer is 7 nickels. Let me just verify once again to be sure.

<execution_3.1>
7 nickels: 7*5=35c, 4 dimes:4*10=40c. 35+40=75c. Total coins 7+4=11. Correct.

<Final_answer>
Therefore, Hillary has $\boxed{7}$ nickels.
