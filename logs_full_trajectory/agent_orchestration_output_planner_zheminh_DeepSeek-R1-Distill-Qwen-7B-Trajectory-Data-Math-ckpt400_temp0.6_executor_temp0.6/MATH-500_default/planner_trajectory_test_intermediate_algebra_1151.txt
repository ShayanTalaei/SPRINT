</Question>

<think>
<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to find the maximum value of this function f(x, y) = x√(1 - y²) + y√(1 - x²), where both x and y are between -1 and 1. Hmm, let's see. I remember that when dealing with functions of multiple variables, one approach is to use partial derivatives to find critical points, but since the domain is compact (closed and bounded), the maximum must be attained somewhere in the domain. Maybe I should check both the interior critical points and the boundaries.

First, let me understand the function better. Each term has a variable multiplied by the square root of 1 minus the square of the other variable. So, both terms are similar but swapped. That symmetry might be useful.

Let me check if there's any symmetry in the variables. If I swap x and y, the function remains the same.
So, f(x, y) = f(y, x). That suggests that maybe the maximum occurs at a point where x = y? Or maybe not necessarily, but it's worth checking.

Let me test some points.

<prompt_1.1> Evaluate the function at some specific points to find the maximum. </prompt_1.1>

Maybe the maximum is 2/√5? Wait, but let me check another approach.

Alternatively, maybe use trigonometric substitution. Since we have square roots of 1 - y² and 1 - x², maybe set x = sinθ and y = sinφ. Then √(1 - y²) = cosφ and √(1 - x²) = cosθ. So the function becomes sinθ cosφ + sinφ cosθ = sin(θ + φ). So f(x, y) = sin(θ + φ). Then the maximum value of sin is 1, so maximum value is 1. But wait, but x and y are both sinθ and sinφ, so θ and φ are between -π/2 and π/2. Then θ + φ can be between -π and π, so sin(θ + φ) can indeed reach 1. But is that possible?

Wait, but if sin(θ + φ) = 1, then θ + φ = π/2 + 2πk. Let's take θ + φ = π/2. Then, θ = π/2 - φ. Let's express x and y in terms of θ and φ.

<prompt_1.2> Verify if the trigonometric substitution approach is valid. </prompt_1.2>

But wait, when I tried x = y = 1/√2, which is approximately 0.707, then the function value is 2/√5 ≈ 0.894. But when I use θ = φ = π/8, then θ + φ = π/4, which gives sin(π/4) = √2/2 ≈ 0.707.

Let's try x = 1 and y = 1. Then f(1, 1) = 1*√(1 - 1) + 1*√(1 - 1) = 0 + 0 = 0. That's not good. How about x = 1 and y = 0? Then f(1, 0) = 1*√1 + 0*√0 = 1 + 0 = 1. Similarly, x = 0 and y = 1 gives the same result. What if x = y = 1/√2? Then f(1/√2, 1/√2) = (1/√2)*√(1 - 1/2) + (1/√2)*√(1 - 1/2) = (1/√2)*(√(1/2)) + same second term. Since √(1/2) is 1/√2, so each term is (1/√2)*(1/√2) = 1/2. So total is 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So that's also 1.

Wait, so both (1,0) and (0,1) give 1, and (1/√2, 1/√2) also gives 1. Hmm. What if I take x = y = something else? Let's say x = y = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866. Then compute each term. First, √(1 - y²) = √(1 - 3/4) = √(1/4) = 1/2. So each term is (sqrt(3)/2)*(1/2) = sqrt(3)/4 ≈ 0.433. So total is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866, which is less than 1. So lower. What if x = 1 and y = something else? Let's say x = 1, then f(1, y) = 1*√(1 - y²) + y*0 = √(1 - y²). So maximum when y = 0, which gives 1. Similarly, if y = 1, then f(x, 1) = x*0 + 1*√(1 - x²) = √(1 - x²), which is maximized at x = 0, giving 1. So on the boundaries where either x or y is 1, the maximum is 1.
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
x = sinθ = sin(π/2 - φ) = cosφ, and y = sinφ. So x = cosφ and y = sinφ. Then x² + y² = cos²φ + sin²φ = 1. So the point (x, y) lies on the unit circle. But x and y are both between -1 and 1, which is consistent. However, if x = cosφ and y = sinφ, then substituting back into f(x, y), we get cosφ * √(1 - sin²φ) + sinφ * √(1 - cos²φ). But √(1 - sin²φ) is cosφ and √(1 - cos²φ) is sinφ, so the expression becomes cosφ * cosφ + sinφ * sinφ = cos²φ + sin²φ = 1. So that gives f(x, y) = 1. But that's just one point where x and y are on the unit circle. However, maybe there's a point where f(x, y) is larger?

<execution_1.3>
Wait, but if θ + φ = π/2, then θ = π/2 - φ. Let's take φ approaching 0, then θ approaches π/2. Then x = sinθ approaches 1, and y = sinφ approaches 0. Then f(x, y) = x√(1 - y²) + y√(1 - x²) ≈ 1*1 + 0*0 = 1. Similarly, if φ approaches π/2, then θ approaches 0, and f(x, y) ≈ 0*1 + 1*1 = 1. So maybe the maximum is 1? But wait, when θ + φ = π/2, then sin(θ + φ) = 1. So if θ + φ = π/2, then x = sinθ, y = sinφ, and f(x, y) = sinθ cosφ + sinφ cosθ = sin(θ + φ) = 1. So actually, if we can have θ + φ = π/2, then f(x, y) = 1. But is that possible?

Wait, but θ and φ are angles such that x = sinθ and y = sinφ. So θ can be between -π/2 and π/2, same with φ. So θ + φ can be between -π and π. But to get θ + φ = π/2, we need θ and φ such that their sum is π/2. For example, θ = π/2 and φ = 0. But θ = π/2 would mean x = sin(π/2) = 1, and φ = 0 would mean y = sin(0) = 0. Then f(1, 0) = 1*√(1 - 0) + 0*√(1 - 1) = 1*1 + 0 = 1. Similarly, if θ = 0 and φ = π/2, then y = 1 and x = 0, so f(0, 1) = 0*1 + 1*1 = 1. So in those cases, the function reaches 1.

Based on execution_1.1:
But wait, could there be a point inside the domain where the function is larger than 1? Let's check.

To find critical points, compute the partial derivatives and set them to zero.

<prompt_2.1> Compute the partial derivatives of the function to find critical points. </prompt_2.1>

Based on execution_1.3:
But earlier, when I set x = y = 1/√2, which corresponds to θ = φ = π/8, then θ + φ = π/4, so sin(θ + φ) = sin(π/4) = √2/2 ≈ 0.707, which is less than 1. So the maximum occurs when θ + φ = π/2, which requires one variable to be 1 and the other 0. So maybe the maximum is indeed 1.

But wait, let me check another angle. Suppose θ + φ = π/2. Let θ = π/2 - φ.

<prompt_2.2> Re-evaluate the trigonometric substitution and confirm the maximum value. </prompt_2.2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
The function is f(x, y) = x√(1 - y²) + y√(1 - x²). Let's compute the partial derivative with respect to x:

∂f/∂x = √(1 - y²) + x*(0) + y*(1/2)(1 - x²)^(-1/2)*(-2x)

Wait, let me do that carefully. The first term is x√(1 - y²). The derivative with respect to x is √(1 - y²). The second term is y√(1 - x²). The derivative with respect to x is y*(1/(2√(1 - x²)))*(-2x) = -xy / √(1 - x²). So overall:

∂f/∂x = √(1 - y²) - (xy)/√(1 - x²)

Similarly, the partial derivative with respect to y is:

∂f/∂y = √(1 - x²) - (xy)/√(1 - y²)

Set both partial derivatives to zero:

√(1 - y²) - (xy)/√(1 - x²) = 0  ... (1)

√(1 - x²) - (xy)/√(1 - y²) = 0  ... (2)
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Then x = sin(π/2 - φ) = cosφ, and y = sinφ. Then, as before, f(x, y) = cosφ * cosφ + sinφ * sinφ = 1. So regardless of φ, as long as x = cosφ and y = sinφ, the function is 1. So all those points on the unit circle give f(x, y) = 1. But wait, if I pick a different parameterization, maybe I can get higher?

Wait, but according to the substitution, if x and y are on the unit circle, then the function is 1. But if x and y are not on the unit circle, then maybe the function can be higher? For example, if x and y are both positive but not on the unit circle. Wait, but if x and y are inside the unit circle, meaning their squares sum to less than 1, then √(1 - y²) and √(1 - x²) would be larger. Hmm, but how does that affect the product?

Wait, let's suppose x and y are both positive. Then both terms x√(1 - y²) and y√(1 - x²) are positive. If x and y are both greater than 1/√2, maybe the sum can be larger? Let's test x = y = 0.9. Then √(1 - 0.81) = √0.19 ≈ 0.435. So each term is 0.9 * 0.435 ≈ 0.391. Total is ≈ 0.783, which is less than 1. So maybe 1 is still the maximum. Alternatively, take x = 0.5, y = √(3)/2 ≈ 0.866. Then √(1 - y²) = √(1 - 3/4) = 1/2. So first term is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25. Second term is 0.866 * √(1 - 0.25) = 0.866 * √0.75 ≈ 0.866 * 0.866 ≈ 0.75. So total is 0.25 + 0.75 = 1. So that gives 1 again.

Based on execution_2.1:
Hmm, solving these equations might be tricky. Let me see if I can manipulate them. Let's denote equation (1):

<prompt_3.1> Solve the system of equations derived from the partial derivatives to find critical points. </prompt_3.1>

Based on execution_2.2:
But when I tried x = y = 1/√2 ≈ 0.707, which is less than 0.866, the sum was 2/√5 ≈ 0.894, which is less than 1. So maybe the maximum is indeed 1.

But let me check another case where x and y are not on the unit circle. Suppose x = 0. Let's see, if x = 0, then f(0, y) = 0 + y*√1 = y, which is maximized at y = 1, giving 1. Similarly, if y = 0, maximum at x = 1, which is 1. So on the axes, the maximum is 1.

Based on execution_2.1:
But maybe there's a critical point inside the domain where x and y are not 0 or 1. Let's try to solve the system of equations.

<prompt_3.2> Re-evaluate the critical points and confirm the maximum value. </prompt_3.2>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
√(1 - y²) = (xy)/√(1 - x²)  ... (1a)

Similarly, equation (2):

√(1 - x²) = (xy)/√(1 - y²)  ... (2a)
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
From equation (1): √(1 - y²) = (xy)/√(1 - x²)

From equation (2): √(1 - x²) = (xy)/√(1 - y²)

So, substituting the left side of equation (1) into equation (2):

√(1 - x²) = (xy)/√(1 - x²)

Multiply both sides by √(1 - x²):

1 - x² = xy

Similarly, from equation (1), squaring both sides:

1 - y² = (x² y²)/(1 - x²)

Multiply both sides by (1 - x²):

(1 - y²)(1 - x²) = x² y²

Expand the left side:

1 - x² - y² + x² y² = x² y²

Subtract x² y² from both sides:

1 - x² - y² = 0

So 1 = x² + y²

Ah! So the critical points occur where x² + y² = 1. That makes sense because in the trigonometric substitution, we had x = cosφ and y = sinφ, which satisfies x² + y² = 1. So the maximum might occur either on the boundary or at the critical points inside the domain. But since x² + y² = 1 is part of the boundary of the domain (since the domain is the square [-1, 1] x [-1, 1], and x² + y² = 1 is a quarter circle in the first quadrant). Wait, but the domain is actually the square from -1 to 1 in both x and y, so the boundary includes the edges and the corners, but also the curves where x² + y² = 1. So the critical points lie on the boundary of the domain. Therefore, the maximum could be on the boundary. But we already saw that on the boundary where x² + y² = 1, the function f(x, y) = 1. However, when we checked points inside the square where x² + y² < 1, like (0.5, 0.866), the function was still 1. Wait, but in that case, x² + y² = 0.25 + 0.75 = 1. So actually, that point is on the boundary. So maybe all points where x² + y² = 1 give f(x, y) = 1, and points inside the square give lower values. So the maximum is 1.

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.2:
But let me verify this. Suppose I take a point inside the square where x² + y² < 1. For example, x = y = 0. Let's see f(0, 0) = 0. If x = 0.5, y = 0.5, then f(0.5, 0.5) = 0.5*√(1 - 0.25) + 0.5*√(1 - 0.25) = 0.5*(√0.75) + 0.5*(√0.75) = √0.75 ≈ 0.866, which is less than 1.

Based on execution_3.1:
Let me square both sides of equation (1a):

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
So maybe 1 is indeed the maximum. But let's check another point. Let's take x = 0.8, y = 0.6. Then x² + y² = 0.64 + 0.36 = 1, so it's on the boundary. Then f(0.8, 0.6) = 0.8*√(1 - 0.36) + 0.6*√(1 - 0.64) = 0.8*√0.64 + 0.6*√0.36 = 0.8*0.8 + 0.6*0.6 = 0.64 + 0.36 = 1. So that's on the boundary. If I take x = 0.7, y = √(1 - 0.49) ≈ √0.51 ≈ 0.714. Then f(0.7, 0.714) ≈ 0.7*√(1 - 0.51) + 0.714*√(1 - 0.49) ≈ 0.7*√0.49 + 0.714*√0.51 ≈ 0.7*0.7 + 0.714*0.714 ≈ 0.49 + 0.51 ≈ 1. So again, it's 1. So it seems that on the boundary where x² + y² = 1, the function f(x, y) is always 1. But inside the domain, where x² + y² < 1, the function is less than 1.
</execution_4.1>

<execution_4.2>
1 - y² = (x² y²)/(1 - x²)

Multiply both sides by (1 - x²):

(1 - y²)(1 - x²) = x² y²

Expanding the left-hand side:

1 - x² - y² + x² y² = x² y²

Subtract x² y² from both sides:

1 - x² - y² = 0

Which implies x² + y² = 1.
</execution_4.2>
</Execution_4>

<Plan_5>
Based on execution_4.1:
So that suggests that the maximum value is 1, achieved on the boundary where x² + y² = 1. But wait, in the earlier trigonometric substitution, x and y are on the unit circle, but in reality, x and y are each between -1 and 1, so the maximum x² + y² can be 2 (if x = y = 1), but in reality, the maximum x² + y² on the domain is 2, but the function f(x, y) at (1,1) is 0. But we saw that on the boundary x² + y² = 1, the function is 1, and inside, it's less. So maybe 1 is the maximum.

But let me check another point. Suppose x = 0.9, y = √(1 - 0.81) = √0.19 ≈ 0.435.

<prompt_5.1> Verify the maximum value by checking another point inside the domain. </prompt_5.1>

Based on execution_4.2:
Therefore, all critical points lie on the boundary x² + y² = 1. But since x and y are in [-1, 1], the boundary here is the quarter circle in the first quadrant. Wait, but x and y can be negative as well. So actually, the boundary where x² + y² = 1 includes all points where either x or y is 1 or -1, but since the maximum of f(x, y) occurs at points where x and y are positive (since if x or y is negative, the terms might subtract), maybe the maximum occurs at (1, 0) or (0, 1), but we saw that both give 1. But according to the trigonometric substitution, if we take θ and φ such that x = cosφ and y = sinφ, then when θ + φ = π/2, we get f(x, y) = 1.

<prompt_5.2> Verify the maximum value by considering the trigonometric substitution and symmetry. </prompt_5.2>
</Plan_5>

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
Then f(x, y) = 0.9*√(1 - 0.81) + 0.435*√(1 - 0.81) ≈ (0.9 + 0.435)*0.435 ≈ 1.335*0.435 ≈ 0.58, which is much less than 1. So definitely, the maximum is higher when approaching the boundary where x² + y² = 1.
</execution_5.1>

<execution_5.2>
So that suggests that 1 is attainable. But how does that relate to the critical points?

Wait, if x² + y² = 1, then the critical points are exactly those points where x = cosφ and y = sinφ, which gives f(x, y) = 1. So that's consistent. Therefore, the maximum value is indeed 1, achieved at all points on the unit circle in the first quadrant (and possibly others due to symmetry). But since x and y can be negative, do negative values give higher function values? Let's check. Suppose x is negative and y is positive. Then the first term x√(1 - y²) would be negative, but the second term y√(1 - x²) would be positive. Depending on the magnitudes, maybe the sum is less. For example, x = -0.5, y = √(1 - 0.25) = √0.75 ≈ 0.866. Then f(-0.5, 0.866) ≈ -0.5*0.866 + 0.866*√(1 - 0.25) ≈ -0.433 + 0.866*0.866 ≈ -0.433 + 0.75 ≈ 0.317, which is much less than 1. Similarly, if both x and y are negative, both terms would be negative, so f(x, y) would be negative. So the maximum must occur when x and y are non-negative. Therefore, the maximum is 1, achieved when x² + y² = 1 and x, y ≥ 0. So the maximum value is 1.

<Plan_6>
Based on execution_5.2:
But let me check if there's any mistake here. Wait, when we did the substitution with θ and φ, we assumed x = sinθ and y = sinφ with θ, φ in [-π/2, π/2]. But if we restrict to the first quadrant, θ and φ in [0, π/2], then x and y are in [0, 1], and x² + y² = sin²θ + sin²φ. But in that case, if θ + φ = π/2, then sinφ = cosθ, so x² + y² = sin²θ + cos²θ = 1. Therefore, all such points (x, y) on the unit circle in the first quadrant satisfy x² + y² = 1, and f(x, y) = 1. So that's consistent with the earlier result.

Therefore, after thorough analysis, the maximum value is 1.
