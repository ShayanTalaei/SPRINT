Okay, so I need to find the value of b when the point (a, b) lies on the line 3x + 2y = 12 and a is given as 4. Let me start by recalling that if a point lies on a line, its coordinates must satisfy the equation of the line. That means if I substitute x with a (which is 4) and y with b, the equation should hold true. Let me write that down step by step.

<prompt_1.1> Substitute the given value of a into the equation 3x + 2y = 12 and solve for b. </prompt_1.1>

First, the equation of the line is 3x + 2y = 12. The point given is (a, b), and we know that a = 4. So substituting x with 4 and y with b, the equation becomes 3*(4) + 2*(b) = 12. Let me compute 3 times 4 first. That's 12. So the equation simplifies to 12 + 2b = 12.

Based on execution_1.1:
Hmm, now I need to solve for b here. Let me subtract 12 from both sides to isolate the term with b. So, 12 + 2b - 12 = 12 - 12.
That simplifies to 2b = 0. Then, dividing both sides by 2, I get b = 0.

Wait, is that right? Let me check.

<prompt_2.1> Verify the solution by substituting the values back into the original equation. </prompt_2.1>

But let me think again. Maybe there's another way to approach this. For instance, maybe finding the equation of the line in slope-intercept form could help confirm the result. Although, the original equation is already in standard form, so converting it might not be necessary, but let's try it.

<prompt_2.2> Convert the line equation to slope-intercept form and verify the result for b. </prompt_2.2>

Alternatively, maybe using parametric equations or another form? Let me see. Alternatively, since the line is 3x + 2y =12, if I consider x and y intercepts, but that might complicate things here. Let's see.

<prompt_2.3> Use x-intercept and y-intercept to verify the solution for b. </prompt_2.3>

Another way to think about it: if I plot the line 3x + 2y =12, when x=4, the corresponding y-value should be 0.
Let me visualize the line. The x-intercept is when y=0, which is 3x=12, so x=4. So the point (4,0) is on the line, which matches our solution. The y-intercept is when x=0, which would be 2y=12, so y=6. So the line crosses the y-axis at (0,6) and the x-axis at (4,0). Connecting those two points would give the line.

<execution_2.1>
If a is 4 and b is 0, then plugging back into the original equation: 3*4 + 2*0 = 12 + 0 = 12, which matches the right side of the equation. So that checks out.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Starting with 3x + 2y = 12. Solving for y, we get 2y = -3x + 12, then y = (-3/2)x + 6. So the slope is -3/2 and the y-intercept is 6. Now, if x = 4, then plugging into this slope-intercept form, y = (-3/2)*4 + 6. Calculating that: (-3/2)*4 is -6, and -6 + 6 is 0. So y = 0. That matches the previous result.
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
If I rewrite the equation in slope-intercept form, y = mx + c. Let's do that. Starting with 3x + 2y =12. Subtract 3x from both sides: 2y = -3x +12. Divide both sides by 2: y = (-3/2)x +6. So the slope is -3/2 and the y-intercept is 6. 

Now, if x=4, then plugging into this equation, y = (-3/2)*4 +6. Let's compute that. (-3/2)*4 is (-3)*(2) = -6. Then, -6 +6 =0. So y=0.

Based on execution_2.1, execution_2.2, execution_2.3:
I think that's thorough.
I considered substitution, converting to slope-intercept form, and checking with the intercepts.
All methods lead to b=0.

Therefore, the value of $b$ when $a = 4$ is $\boxed{0}$.
