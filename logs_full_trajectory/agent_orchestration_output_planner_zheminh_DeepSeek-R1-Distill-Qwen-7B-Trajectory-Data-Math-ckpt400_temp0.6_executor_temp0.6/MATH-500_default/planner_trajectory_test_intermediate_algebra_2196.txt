Find the maximum value of
\[\frac{x - y}{x^4 + y^4 + 6}\]over all real numbers $x$ and $y.$
</Question>

<think>
<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to find the maximum value of the expression (x - y)/(x⁴ + y⁴ + 6) where x and y are real numbers. Hmm, let's start by understanding what this function looks like and how to approach maximizing it.

<prompt_1.1> Understand the given expression and determine if it is bounded. </prompt_1.1>
-----

But maybe there's a way to use calculus here. Let's consider treating this as a function of two variables, f(x, y) = (x - y)/(x⁴ + y⁴ + 6). To find its critical points, we can compute the partial derivatives with respect to x and y, set them to zero, and solve.

<prompt_1.2> Set up the partial derivatives for the function \( f(x, y) = \frac{x - y}{x^4 + y^4 + 6} \). </prompt_1.2>
-----

Alternatively, maybe we can use some inequality here. The numerator is linear, and the denominator is a sum of fourth powers plus a constant. Fourth powers grow faster than linear terms, so perhaps the denominator dominates as x and y get large, which would suggest that the maximum occurs somewhere at a moderate value.

Alternatively, maybe we can use substitution. Let me set t = x - y, so that the numerator becomes t. Then, perhaps express x in terms of y and t: x = y + t. Substitute into the denominator: (y + t)^4 + y^4 + 6. Then the function becomes t / [ (y + t)^4 + y^4 + 6 ]. Now, this is a function of y and t. Maybe for fixed t, we can find the maximum over y?

Alternatively, perhaps set y = 0 to simplify. Let's see what happens if we set y = 0.

<prompt_1.3> Evaluate the function when \( y = 0 \) and consider symmetry by swapping \( x \) and \( y \). </prompt_1.3>
-----

But wait, let's check another case. Suppose x and y are both negative. Let me set x = -a, y = -b, where a, b > 0.

<prompt_1.4> Evaluate the function when both \( x \) and \( y \) are negative. </prompt_1.4>

Alternatively, maybe set y = kx for some constant k. Let's try that substitution. Let y = kx, where k is a real number.

<prompt_1.5> Substitute \( y = kx \) into the function and analyze the resulting expression. </prompt_1.5>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
First, I notice that the denominator is always positive because x⁴ and y⁴ are non-negative for all real x and y, and adding 6 ensures it's at least 6. The numerator, x - y, can be positive or negative depending on the values of x and y. Since we're looking for the maximum value, we should focus on when the numerator is positive, meaning x > y. 

So, the problem is to maximize a fraction where the numerator can be positive or negative, but we're interested in the maximum positive value. That suggests the maximum occurs when x - y is maximized relative to the denominator.
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
The partial derivative with respect to x would be [1*(x⁴ + y⁴ + 6) - (x - y)*(4x³)] / (x⁴ + y⁴ + 6)². Similarly, the partial derivative with respect to y would be [ -1*(x⁴ + y⁴ + 6) - (x - y)*(4y³) ] / (x⁴ + y⁴ + 6)². Setting these equal to zero gives the system of equations:

1. (x⁴ + y⁴ + 6) - (x - y)*(4x³) = 0
2. - (x⁴ + y⁴ + 6) - (x - y)*(4y³) = 0
</execution_1.2>

<execution_1.3>
Then the expression becomes (x - 0)/(x⁴ + 0 + 6) = x/(x⁴ + 6). We can analyze this function of x. Let's call this f(x) = x/(x⁴ + 6). To find its maximum, take derivative: f’(x) = [1*(x⁴ +6) - x*(4x³)]/(x⁴ +6)^2 = (x⁴ +6 -4x⁴)/(x⁴ +6)^2 = (-3x⁴ +6)/(x⁴ +6)^2. Setting numerator to zero: -3x⁴ +6 =0 → x⁴ =2 → x=±√[4]{2}. Since we set y=0 here, and x is in the numerator as x - y, so if y=0, then x positive would make the numerator positive. So maximum in this case would be at x=√[4]{2}, giving value √[4]{2}/( (√[4]{2})⁴ +6 ) = √[4]{2}/(2 +6)= √[4]{2}/8 ≈ 1.189/8 ≈0.1486. But this is just a particular case when y=0. Maybe the maximum occurs when both x and y are non-zero?
</execution_1.3>

<execution_1.4>
Then the expression becomes (-a + b)/((-a)^4 + (-b)^4 + 6) = (b - a)/(a^4 + b^4 + 6). Which is similar to the original expression. So the maximum when x and y are negative would be the same as when a and b are positive. So symmetry here suggests that the maximum value would be the same as in the positive case.
</execution_1.4>

<execution_1.5>
Then the function becomes:

Numerator: x - y = x - kx = x(1 - k)

Denominator: x⁴ + y⁴ + 6 = x⁴ + (kx)^4 + 6 = x⁴(1 + k⁴) + 6

So the function is [x(1 - k)] / [x⁴(1 + k⁴) + 6]

Let me set z = x³. Then x = z^(1/3). Wait, maybe that's complicating. Alternatively, let's consider for fixed k, find the maximum over x.

Let’s denote f(x) = [x(1 - k)] / [x⁴(1 + k⁴) + 6]

To find the maximum, take derivative with respect to x:

f’(x) = [ (1 - k)(x⁴(1 + k⁴) + 6) - x(1 - k)(4x³(1 + k⁴)) ] / [x⁴(1 + k⁴) + 6]^2

Set numerator to zero:

(1 - k)(x⁴(1 + k⁴) + 6) - x(1 - k)(4x³(1 + k⁴)) = 0

Factor out (1 - k):

(1 - k)[x⁴(1 + k⁴) + 6 - 4x⁴(1 + k⁴)] = 0

So either 1 - k = 0, which gives k = 1, but then numerator becomes zero, so f(x) = 0, which is minimum. So discard that.

Otherwise, set the bracket to zero:

x⁴(1 + k⁴) + 6 - 4x⁴(1 + k⁴) = 0

Simplify:

-3x⁴(1 + k⁴) + 6 = 0

=> 3x⁴(1 + k⁴) = 6

=> x⁴ = 6 / [3(1 + k⁴)] = 2 / (1 + k⁴)

So x = [2 / (1 + k⁴)]^(1/4)

Thus, for each k ≠ 1, the critical point is at x = [2 / (1 + k⁴)]^(1/4), and y = kx.

Then, substitute back into f(x, y):

Numerator: x(1 - k) = [2 / (1 + k⁴)]^(1/4) * (1 - k)

Denominator: x⁴(1 + k⁴) + 6 = [2 / (1 + k⁴)]*(1 + k⁴) + 6 = 2 + 6 = 8

Therefore, the value at the critical point is [2 / (1 + k⁴)]^(1/4) * (1 - k) / 8

So the function value at critical point is [ (1 - k) * (2 / (1 + k⁴))^(1/4) ] / 8

Now, our task reduces to maximizing this expression over k ≠ 1.

Let’s denote this expression as:

F(k) = [ (1 - k) * (2 / (1 + k⁴))^(1/4) ] / 8

We need to find the maximum of F(k) over real numbers k ≠ 1.

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Let me consider the denominator. Since x⁴ + y⁴ is always non-negative, the denominator is at least 6. So the denominator is minimized when x⁴ + y⁴ is minimized. Maybe the maximum of the fraction occurs when x⁴ + y⁴ is as small as possible while x - y is as large as possible. But there's a trade-off here because making x - y large might require x and y to be far apart, which could make x⁴ + y⁴ large as well. Conversely, if x and y are close, x⁴ + y⁴ might be small, but then x - y might not be large. So there's a balance to be struck.

Let me try to formalize this. Suppose we fix the difference t = x - y.

<prompt_2.1> Formalize the problem by fixing the difference \( t = x - y \) and express the denominator in terms of \( t \). </prompt_2.1>
-----

Based on execution_1.2:
Let's write them out:

1. (x⁴ + y⁴ + 6) - 4x³(x - y) = 0

<prompt_2.2> Derive and simplify the equations from the partial derivatives set to zero. </prompt_2.2>

Based on execution_1.3:
Alternatively, maybe try setting y = -x. Let's see.

<prompt_2.3> Evaluate the function when \( y = -x \) and consider symmetry by swapping \( x \) and \( y \). </prompt_2.3>
-----

Based on execution_1.4:
So maybe the maximum occurs when x and y are both positive? Let's focus on positive x and y for now.

Alternatively, perhaps set y = 0, as before, but we saw that gives a lower value. Maybe the maximum occurs when x and y are both positive but not necessarily one zero.
-----

Based on execution_1.5:
Let’s write F(k) as:

F(k) = (1 - k) * [2 / (1 + k⁴)]^(1/4) / 8

Simplify constants:

= (1 - k) / 8 * (2)^(1/4) / (1 + k⁴)^(1/4)

= (1 - k) * 2^(1/4) / [8 * (1 + k⁴)^(1/4)]

Note that 8 = 2^3, so 8 * (1 + k⁴)^(1/4) = 2^3 * (1 + k⁴)^(1/4). Let's write everything in terms of exponents:

= (1 - k) * 2^(1/4) / [2^3 * (1 + k⁴)^(1/4)]

= (1 - k) / 2^(11/4) * (1 + k⁴)^(-1/4)

Hmm, seems a bit messy. Maybe take logarithms to handle the maximization.

Let’s take natural logarithm of F(k):

ln F(k) = ln(1 - k) + (1/4) ln 2 + (-11/4) ln 2 - (1/4) ln(1 + k⁴)

Wait, maybe step by step:

<prompt_2.4> Take the logarithm of \( F(k) \) and simplify the expression. </prompt_2.4>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Then, x = y + t. Substitute into the denominator: (y + t)^4 + y^4 + 6. Then, the problem becomes maximizing t / [ (y + t)^4 + y^4 + 6 ]. Now, if we can express this in terms of t and y, but this might not be straightforward.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
2. - (x⁴ + y⁴ + 6) -4y³(x - y) = 0

Simplify equation 1:

x⁴ + y⁴ + 6 - 4x⁴ + 4x³y = 0

Wait, no. Wait, original equation 1 is:

(x⁴ + y⁴ + 6) - 4x³(x - y) = 0

So expanding that:

x⁴ + y⁴ + 6 - 4x⁴ + 4x³y = 0

Combine like terms:

(1 - 4)x⁴ + y⁴ + 4x³y + 6 = 0

-3x⁴ + y⁴ + 4x³y + 6 = 0 ... (1)

Similarly, equation 2:

- (x⁴ + y⁴ + 6) -4y³(x - y) = 0

Expand:

- x⁴ - y⁴ -6 -4x y³ + 4y⁴ = 0

Combine like terms:

- x⁴ + (-1 +4)y⁴ -4x y³ -6 = 0

- x⁴ + 3y⁴ -4x y³ -6 = 0 ... (2)
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
If x = -a, y = -b, then the numerator becomes -a - (-b) = -a + b = b - a. The denominator becomes (-a)^4 + (-b)^4 +6 = a⁴ + b⁴ +6. So it's the same as the original expression with x = a and y = b. Therefore, the function is symmetric in the sense that swapping x and y and changing signs doesn't affect the value. So maybe the maximum occurs at some symmetric point?
</execution_2.3>

<execution_2.4>
ln F(k) = ln[(1 - k) * 2^(1/4) / (8 * (1 + k⁴)^(1/4))]

= ln(1 - k) + ln(2^(1/4)) - ln(8) - ln((1 + k⁴)^(1/4))

= ln(1 - k) + (1/4) ln 2 - 3 ln 2 - (1/4) ln(1 + k⁴)

Simplify constants:

(1/4) ln 2 - 3 ln 2 = (1/4 - 3) ln 2 = (-11/4) ln 2

Thus,

ln F(k) = ln(1 - k) - (11/4) ln 2 - (1/4) ln(1 + k⁴)

To maximize ln F(k), we can take derivative with respect to k and set to zero.

Let’s compute d/dk [ln F(k)]:

d/dk [ln(1 - k)] - (1/4) * d/dk [ln(1 + k⁴)]

= [ -1/(1 - k) ] - (1/4) * [4k³/(1 + k⁴)]

Simplify:

= -1/(1 - k) - k³/(1 + k⁴)

Set derivative equal to zero:

-1/(1 - k) - k³/(1 + k⁴) = 0

Multiply both sides by -1:

1/(1 - k) + k³/(1 + k⁴) = 0

Based on execution_2.2:
This seems complicated. Maybe subtract equation 2 from equation 1?

Wait, equations 1 and 2 are:

1. -3x⁴ + y⁴ + 4x³y + 6 = 0

<prompt_3.1> Subtract equation 2 from equation 1 and simplify the result. </prompt_3.1>
-----

Based on execution_2.4:
But 1/(1 - k) is positive if k < 1, and k³/(1 + k⁴) is positive if k > 0, since 1 + k⁴ is always positive.

<prompt_3.2> Analyze the equation obtained from setting the derivative to zero to find possible values of \( k \). </prompt_3.2>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
2. -x⁴ + 3y⁴ -4x y³ -6 = 0

Subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

(-3x⁴ + y⁴ + 4x³y + 6) - (-x⁴ + 3y⁴ -4x y³ -6) = 0 - 0

Compute term by term:

-3x⁴ - (-x⁴) = -2x⁴

y⁴ - 3y⁴ = -2y⁴

4x³y - (-4x y³) = 4x³y +4x y³

6 - (-6) = 12

So overall:

-2x⁴ -2y⁴ +4x³y +4x y³ +12 =0

Divide both sides by -2:

x⁴ + y⁴ -2x³y -2x y³ -6 =0

Hmm, not sure if that helps.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
So if k is positive, then both terms are positive, and their sum can't be zero. If k is negative, then 1 - k > 1, so 1/(1 - k) is positive, and k³ is negative, so k³/(1 + k⁴) is negative. So maybe there's a solution when k is negative.
</execution_3.2>
</Execution_3>

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.2:
Let me check.

Suppose k is negative. Let’s set k = -m where m > 0.

<prompt_4.1> Substitute \( k = -m \) into the equation and determine if a solution is possible. </prompt_4.1>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
Then:

1/(1 - (-m)) + (-m)^3/(1 + (-m)^4) = 0

Simplify:

1/(1 + m) + (-m³)/(1 + m⁴) = 0

Multiply both sides by (1 + m)(1 + m⁴):

(1 + m⁴) - m³(1 + m) = 0

Expand:

1 + m⁴ - m³ - m⁴ = 0

Simplify:

1 - m³ =0 → m³ =1 → m=1

Thus, the only solution is m=1, so k = -1.

So critical point at k = -1.

Based on execution_4.1:
Let’s check if this satisfies the original derivative equation.

Plug k = -1 into:

1/(1 - (-1)) + (-1)^3/(1 + (-1)^4) = 1/2 + (-1)/(1 +1) = 1/2 -1/2 =0.
</execution_5.1>
</Execution_5>

<Plan_6>
Based on execution_5.1:
So the only critical point occurs at k = -1. Let's check if this gives a maximum.

Compute F(-1):

<prompt_6.1> Calculate the function value at \( k = -1 \) and confirm it is a maximum. </prompt_6.1>
</Plan_6>

<Execution_6>
<execution_6.1>
F(-1) = [ (1 - (-1)) * 2^(1/4) ] / [8 * (1 + (-1)^4)^(1/4) ]

Simplify:

(1 - (-1)) = 2

(-1)^4 =1, so 1 +1 =2

Thus:

F(-1) = [2 * 2^(1/4)] / [8 * 2^(1/4)] = 2 /8 = 1/4

So the maximum value of F(k) is 1/4, achieved when k = -1.
</execution_6.1>
</Execution_6>

<Plan_7>
Based on execution_6.1:
But wait, let's check. Wait, let's compute step by step:

<prompt_7.1> Re-evaluate the calculations to confirm the maximum value of \( F(k) \). </prompt_7.1>
</Plan_7>

<Execution_7>
<execution_7.1>
First, 1 - (-1) = 2.

2 / (8 * (1 + (-1)^4)^(1/4))

But (-1)^4 is 1, so 1 +1 =2. Then 2^(1/4) is the fourth root of 2. So:

2 * 2^(1/4) / [8 * 2^(1/4)] = 2 /8 = 1/4. Yes, correct.

So F(-1) =1/4. So this suggests that the maximum value of the original expression is 1/4.
</execution_7.1>
</Execution_7>

<Plan_8>
Based on execution_7.1:
But let's verify this. Let's go back to substitution when we set y = kx.

<prompt_8.1> Verify the maximum value by checking the consistency of the solution. </prompt_8.1>
</Plan_8>

<Execution_8>
<execution_8.1>
When k = -1, then y = -x.

So, substitute y = -x into the original function:

Numerator: x - (-x) = x + x = 2x

Denominator: x⁴ + (-x)^4 +6 = x⁴ +x⁴ +6 =2x⁴ +6

So the function becomes 2x / (2x⁴ +6) = (2x)/(2(x⁴ +3)) = x/(x⁴ +3)

Now, find the maximum of x/(x⁴ +3). Let's compute its derivative:

f(x) = x/(x⁴ +3)

f’(x) = [1*(x⁴ +3) -x*(4x³)]/(x⁴ +3)^2 = (x⁴ +3 -4x⁴)/(x⁴ +3)^2 = (-3x⁴ +3)/(x⁴ +3)^2

Set numerator to zero:

-3x⁴ +3 =0 → x⁴ =1 →x=±1

Thus, maximum at x=1 (since we need positive x for maximum):

f(1)=1/(1 +3)=1/4. Similarly, x=-1 gives -1/(1 +3)= -1/4, which is a minimum.

Therefore, the maximum value is indeed 1/4, achieved when x=1, y=-1.

Therefore, the maximum value of the original expression is 1/4, achieved at x=1, y=-1.
</execution_8.1>
</Execution_8>

<Plan_9>
Based on execution_8.1:
But let's check if there are other critical points. For example, when we set y =0, we found x=√[4]{2} gives a lower value. When we set x=y, the denominator is 2y⁴ +6, numerator is 0, so that's minimum.

<prompt_9.1> Confirm the maximum value by considering other potential critical points and confirm the result. </prompt_9.1>
</Plan_9>

<Execution_9>
<execution_9.1>
When x=1, y=-1, we get 1/4. Let's check another point. Suppose x=2, y=-2.

Then numerator is 4, denominator is 2⁴ + (-2)^4 +6=16 +16 +6=38, so 4/38≈0.105, which is less than 1/4≈0.25. So indeed, 1/4 is larger.

Alternatively, take x=1, y=0: (1 -0)/(1 +0 +6)=1/7≈0.142, which is less than 1/4.

Another test point: x= √2, y= -√2.

Numerator: √2 - (-√2)=2√2≈2.828

Denominator: (√2)^4 + (-√2)^4 +6=4 +4 +6=14

So 2.828/14≈0.202, still less than 0.25.

So seems like 1/4 is indeed the maximum.

But to be thorough, let's check if there are other critical points. Suppose we consider the case when k is not -1. For example, suppose k=1. Then y =x. But then numerator is zero, so the function is zero, which is minimum. If k=0, y=0, which we already checked. If k approaches infinity, then x is [2 / (1 +k⁴)]^(1/4). As k→infty, x≈k^{-1}, so x approaches zero. Then, the function becomes (1 -k)*k^{-1} /8 ≈ ( -k ) /k /8 = -1/8, which tends to zero from below. Similarly, for negative k, but we already found k=-1 gives maximum.

Thus, after thorough analysis, the maximum value is 1/4, achieved at x=1, y=-1. Therefore, the answer is 1/4.
