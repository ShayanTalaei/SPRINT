</Question>

<think>
<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to find the coordinates of the fourth vertex of a parallelogram, given three vertices: (5, 3), (6, 8), (7, 4), and (x, y) where x > 7. Then, calculate x + y. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that in a parallelogram, the opposite sides are equal and parallel, and the diagonals bisect each other. That means the midpoint of one diagonal should be the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal. Maybe I can use that property here.

Let me recall the midpoint formula. The midpoint of a line segment connecting two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2). So, if I can figure out which points are diagonally opposite, I can set their midpoints equal.

But wait, I don't know which points are connected by diagonals. There are three given points, and the fourth is unknown. Let me label the points for clarity. Let's say the points are A(5,3), B(6,8), C(7,4), and D(x,y). In a parallelogram, the diagonals are AC and BD, or AB and CD, or AD and BC? Wait, no. Actually, in a parallelogram, each pair of opposite sides are equal and parallel, so the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. The diagonals would be AC and BD. So, the midpoints of AC and BD should be the same.

So, if I compute the midpoint of AC and set it equal to the midpoint of BD, I can solve for D(x,y).

Let me try that.

First, compute midpoint of AC.

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this problem. For example, using vectors or coordinate geometry by ensuring that vectors AB and DC are equal, and vectors AD and BC are equal.

Let me try that approach as a cross-check.

First, vector approach. In a parallelogram, vectors AB and DC should be equal, and vectors AD and BC should be equal.

<prompt_1.2> Follow the above plan to use vectors to find the coordinates of D. </prompt_1.2>

Alternatively, another method: plotting the points. Let me visualize the points.

Point A is (5,3), B is (6,8), C is (7,4). Let me try to plot them mentally.

<prompt_1.3> Follow the above plan to plot the points and use the property of parallelogram sides to find D. </prompt_1.3>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
A is (5,3) and C is (7,4). So midpoint is ((5 + 7)/2, (3 + 4)/2) = (12/2, 7/2) = (6, 3.5).

Now, midpoint of BD should also be (6, 3.5). B is (6,8), and D is (x,y). So midpoint of BD is ((6 + x)/2, (8 + y)/2). Set this equal to (6, 3.5).

Therefore:

(6 + x)/2 = 6  --> Multiply both sides by 2: 6 + x = 12  --> x = 12 - 6 = 6

and

(8 + y)/2 = 3.5  --> Multiply both sides by 2: 8 + y = 7  --> y = 7 - 8 = -1

Wait, but the problem states that x > 7. However, according to this, x = 6, which is less than 7. That's a problem. So this can't be the correct diagonal pairing.
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
Let's compute vector AB. Coordinates of B minus coordinates of A: (6-5, 8-3) = (1,5). So vector AB is (1,5). Then, vector DC should also be (1,5). Since D is (x,y), vector DC is C - D = (7 - x, 4 - y). So setting that equal to (1,5):

7 - x = 1 => x = 6

4 - y = 5 => y = -1

But wait, this gives x=6, y=-1. However, the problem states that x >7, so this solution is invalid. Hmm, maybe this approach is considering a different pair of sides.
</execution_1.2>

<execution_1.3>
From A(5,3) to B(6,8): moving 1 right, 5 up. Then from B(6,8) to C(7,4): moving 1 right, 5 down. Then from C(7,4) to D: if it's a parallelogram, the vector from C to D should be the same as the vector from A to B? Wait, no. Wait, in a parallelogram, the vector from A to B should be the same as the vector from D to C. Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of vectors.

Wait, let's define vectors. Let me consider the sides. If AB and DC are opposite sides, then vector AB should equal vector DC. Similarly, vector AD should equal vector BC.

Vector AB is B - A = (6-5, 8-3) = (1,5). So vector DC should also be (1,5). Since D is (x,y), and C is (7,4), then vector DC is C - D = (7 - x, 4 - y). So, setting this equal to (1,5):

7 - x = 1 => x = 6

4 - y = 5 => y = -1

But wait, that gives D as (6, -1), but the problem states x > 7, so this solution is invalid. Hmm, maybe I assigned the vectors incorrectly.

Alternatively, maybe vector AB equals vector DC. Wait, vector AB is (1,5). So vector DC should be (1,5). But vector DC is C - D, so:

C - D = (1,5) => D = C - (1,5) = (7 -1, 4 -5) = (6, -1). Again, same result. So D is (6,-1). But x must be greater than 7, so this is not acceptable.

Alternatively, maybe vector AD equals vector BC. Let's try that. Vector BC is C - B = (7-6, 4-8) = (1, -4). So vector AD should be (1, -4). Since A is (5,3), then D = A + vector AD = (5 +1, 3 + (-4)) = (6, -1). Again, same result. So this gives D(6,-1), which is invalid because x must be greater than 7.

Based on execution_1.1:
Hmm, maybe the issue is with which points are considered adjacent. Maybe the given points are not in order. Let me think.

Wait, the problem just states the coordinates of a parallelogram are (5,3), (6,8), (7,4), and (x,y). It doesn't specify the order of the vertices. So maybe the points are not given in sequence. That complicates things because depending on the order, the diagonals could be different.

So perhaps I need to consider different possible pairings of the points as adjacent vertices, leading to different possible positions for the fourth vertex.

Let me try to approach this systematically.

First, recall that in a parallelogram, the vector from one vertex to the next should be equal to the vector from the opposite vertex to its next vertex. So if we have vertices in order A, B, C, D, then vector AB = vector DC, and vector BC = vector AD.

<prompt_2.1> Follow the above plan to consider different pairings of points as adjacent vertices to find the fourth vertex. </prompt_2.1>

Based on execution_1.2:
Alternatively, maybe the given points are not in order. Let's see. Suppose we don't know the order of the points, so maybe the three given points are A, B, C, and D is the fourth. Depending on which points are connected how, we can have different solutions.

Alternatively, maybe the three given points are three vertices of the parallelogram, and we need to find the fourth. Since in a parallelogram, given three vertices, there can be three possible positions for the fourth vertex, depending on which three are considered. But here, since x >7 is specified, perhaps only one of them is valid.

Let me recall that method. If you have three points of a parallelogram, the fourth point can be found by vector addition.

<prompt_2.2> Follow the above plan to find the fourth vertex using vector addition and check for consistency with previous results. </prompt_2.2>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
But since the order isn't given, we have to consider different possibilities.

Alternatively, another approach is that in a parallelogram, the sum of the vectors of the sides equals zero. So, if we take vectors AB + BC + CD + DA = 0. But maybe that's complicating.

Alternatively, since the midpoints of the diagonals must coincide, regardless of the order. So if we can pair the given points as diagonally opposite, then their midpoints should be the same. But since we have three points, the fourth point can be found by ensuring that the midpoint of the other diagonal is the same.

Wait, but the problem is that we don't know which points are paired as diagonals. So maybe we need to test different combinations.

Suppose we take two of the given points as one diagonal, then compute the fourth point such that the midpoint of the other diagonal matches. But since there are three points, there are three possible ways to pair them as diagonals. Let me try each possibility.

First possibility: Suppose (5,3) and (6,8) are the endpoints of a diagonal. Then the midpoint is ((5 + 6)/2, (3 + 8)/2) = (11/2, 11/2). Then, the other two points (7,4) and (x,y) must form the other diagonal, which should have the same midpoint. So midpoint of (7,4) and (x,y) should be (11/2, 11/2). Therefore:

(7 + x)/2 = 11/2  --> 7 + x = 11  --> x = 4

(4 + y)/2 = 11/2  --> 4 + y = 11  --> y = 7

But x = 4, which is not greater than 7. So this solution is invalid as per the problem's condition x > 7.

Second possibility: Suppose (5,3) and (7,4) are the endpoints of a diagonal. Then midpoint is ((5 +7)/2, (3 +4)/2) = (12/2, 7/2) = (6, 3.5). Then the other two points (6,8) and (x,y) must form the other diagonal with the same midpoint. So:

(6 + x)/2 = 6  --> 6 + x = 12  --> x =6

(8 + y)/2 = 3.5  --> 8 + y =7  --> y = -1

But x =6, which is not greater than 7. So invalid.

Third possibility: Suppose (6,8) and (7,4) are the endpoints of a diagonal. Midpoint is ((6 +7)/2, (8 +4)/2) = (13/2, 12/2) = (6.5,6). Then the other two points (5,3) and (x,y) must form the other diagonal with midpoint (6.5,6). Therefore:

(5 + x)/2 = 6.5  --> 5 + x =13  --> x=8

(3 + y)/2 =6  --> 3 + y =12  --> y=9

So here, x=8, which is greater than7, and y=9. So this gives (x,y)=(8,9). Then x + y=17.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Suppose the three points are A, B, C. Then the fourth point D can be found in three ways:

1. If AB and AC are sides, then D = B + AC - A? Wait, maybe not. Let me think.

Alternatively, using the property that the sum of the vectors is zero. Wait, perhaps the position vector of D is equal to A + B + C - D = 0? Wait, no. Wait, the midpoint method is better.

Wait, another method: in a parallelogram, the coordinates of the fourth vertex can be found by:

If three vertices are (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3), then the fourth vertex (x4,y4) can be (x2 + x3 - x1, y2 + y3 - y1) or some permutation of this, depending on which three points are considered.

Yes, that's a formula I remember. So, depending on which three points are considered as part of the parallelogram, the fourth point can be calculated.

So, for example, if the given three points are A, B, C, then the fourth point D can be B + C - A. Similarly, if the three points are A, B, D, then C would be A + D - B, etc.

But since we need to find D such that x >7, let's try all possible combinations.

Case 1: Suppose the three given points are A(5,3), B(6,8), C(7,4). Then D = B + C - A = (6 +7 -5, 8 +4 -3) = (8, 9). So D(8,9). Then x=8>7, which satisfies the condition. Then x + y = 8 +9=17.

Case 2: Suppose the three given points are A(5,3), B(6,8), D(x,y). Then the fourth point would be C = A + D - B. But since C is given as (7,4), then D = C + B - A = (7 +6 -5, 4 +8 -3)= (8,9). Same as before.

Case 3: Suppose the three given points are A(5,3), C(7,4), D(x,y). Then the fourth point B = A + D - C. But B is given as (6,8). So D = B + C - A = (6 +7 -5, 8 +4 -3)= (8,9). Same result.

Case 4: Suppose the three given points are B(6,8), C(7,4), D(x,y). Then the fourth point A = B + D - C. But A is given as (5,3). So D = A + C - B = (5 +7 -6, 3 +4 -8)= (6, -1). Which is the same as before, x=6 <7, so invalid.

Therefore, the only valid solution is D(8,9), giving x + y =17.

Based on execution_2.1:
Wait, but I need to verify if (7,4), (6,8), (8,9) form a parallelogram with (5,3). Let me check the midpoints again.

<prompt_3.1> Verify the solution by checking the midpoints of the diagonals and ensuring the sides are parallel. </prompt_3.1>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
If the diagonals are (5,3) and (6,8), their midpoint is (5.5, 5.5). The other diagonal is (7,4) and (8,9), midpoint is (7.5, 6.5). Wait, that's not the same. Wait, that contradicts the earlier calculation. Wait, no, hold on. Wait, in this case, we considered (6,8) and (7,4) as one diagonal, with midpoint (6.5,6). Then the other diagonal is (5,3) and (8,9). Let's compute their midpoint: (5 +8)/2 =13/2=6.5, (3 +9)/2=12/2=6. So midpoint (6.5,6). Therefore, that's correct. So the diagonals are (6,8)-(7,4) and (5,3)-(8,9), both with midpoint (6.5,6).

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
So, the coordinates are (5,3), (6,8), (7,4), (8,9). Let me check if this forms a parallelogram.

To confirm, let's check the vectors.

<prompt_4.1> Verify the solution by checking the vectors between consecutive points to ensure opposite sides are equal and parallel. </prompt_4.1>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
Compute vectors between consecutive points.

From (5,3) to (6,8): (6-5, 8-3) = (1,5)

From (7,4) to (8,9): (8-7,9-4) = (1,5). So these sides are equal and parallel.

From (6,8) to (7,4): (7-6,4-8) = (1,-4)

From (8,9) to (5,3): (5-8,3-9) = (-3,-6). Wait, that's not equal to (1,-4). Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, maybe the sides are not in order. Wait, perhaps the order of the points is different.

Wait, maybe the order is (5,3), (6,8), (8,9), (7,4). Let me check.

From (5,3) to (6,8): (1,5)

From (6,8) to (8,9): (2,1)

From (8,9) to (7,4): (-1,-5)

From (7,4) to (5,3): (-2,-1)

Hmm, this doesn't look like a parallelogram. Wait, perhaps the order is different. Let me think. Since the diagonals are (6,8)-(7,4) and (5,3)-(8,9), maybe the vertices are arranged as (5,3), (6,8), (8,9), (7,4). Let's see:

(5,3) connected to (6,8), then to (8,9), then to (7,4), then back to (5,3). Let's compute the vectors:

(5,3) to (6,8): (1,5)

(6,8) to (8,9): (2,1)

(8,9) to (7,4): (-1,-5)

(7,4) to (5,3): (-2,-1)

This doesn't look like a parallelogram because opposite sides are not equal. The sides (1,5) and (2,1) are not equal, and (-1,-5) and (-2,-1) are not equal. So maybe the order is different.

Alternatively, maybe the order is (5,3), (8,9), (6,8), (7,4). Let's check:

(5,3) to (8,9): (3,6)

(8,9) to (6,8): (-2,-1)

(6,8) to (7,4): (1,-4)

(7,4) to (5,3): (-2,-1)

Still, opposite sides aren't matching. Hmm, maybe I need to check the vectors differently.

Wait, perhaps the sides are (5,3) to (7,4), then (7,4) to (8,9), then (8,9) to (6,8), then back. Let's compute:

(5,3) to (7,4): (2,1)

(7,4) to (8,9): (1,5)

(8,9) to (6,8): (-2,-1)

(6,8) to (5,3): (-1,-5)

Again, opposite sides (2,1) and (-2,-1) are not equal, and (1,5) and (-1,-5) are negatives, but not equal. Wait, actually, in a parallelogram, opposite sides should be equal and parallel, so vectors should be equal. Here, (5,3) to (7,4) is (2,1), and (8,9) to (6,8) is (-2,-1), which is the negative, so they are parallel but opposite in direction. Similarly, (7,4) to (8,9) is (1,5), and (6,8) to (5,3) is (-1,-5). So these are also negatives. So actually, this is a parallelogram because the opposite sides are equal in magnitude and direction when considering vectors. The direction depends on the order, but the vectors are scalar multiples (negative), which still means they are parallel. So as long as the opposite sides are equal vectors, it's a parallelogram.

So in this case, the sides from (5,3) to (7,4) and from (6,8) to (8,9) are both (2,1) and (2,1). Wait, no. Wait, (5,3) to (7,4) is (2,1), and (6,8) to (8,9) is (2,1). So those two sides are equal. Then, (7,4) to (8,9) is (1,5), and (5,3) to (6,8) is (1,5). So those are also equal. Therefore, opposite sides are equal and parallel, so it is a parallelogram.

Wait, but the order of the points is important. If we list the points as (5,3), (7,4), (8,9), (6,8), then connecting them in that order would form a parallelogram. Let me confirm:

From (5,3) to (7,4): right 2, up 1

From (7,4) to (8,9): right 1, up 5

From (8,9) to (6,8): left 2, down 1

From (6,8) to (5,3): left 1, down 5

Yes, this forms a parallelogram. The sides alternate between (2,1) and (1,5), each pair equal and parallel. Therefore, this is a valid parallelogram.

Based on execution_4.1:
But let me check another possibility. Suppose the three given points are considered as three vertices with different pairings. For example, maybe (5,3) and (7,4) are adjacent, and (6,8) is another vertex.

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
Wait, but we already considered that. The key is that depending on which three points you take as part of the parallelogram, the fourth point can be in different positions. But in this case, only when we pair (6,8) and (7,4) as a diagonal do we get a valid x >7. So that must be the solution.

Therefore, after considering all possibilities and verifying the midpoints and the vectors, I'm confident that the correct value is 17.

Therefore, the value of $x + y$ is $\boxed{17}$.
