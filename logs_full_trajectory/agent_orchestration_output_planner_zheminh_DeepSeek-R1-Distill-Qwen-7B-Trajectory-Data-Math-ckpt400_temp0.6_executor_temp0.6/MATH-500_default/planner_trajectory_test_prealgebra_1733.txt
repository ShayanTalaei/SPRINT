<Question>
The expression $$1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6$$is equivalent to 13. If we add parentheses in various locations, we can change this value. For example, $1+2+3-(4+5)+6=1+2+3-9+6=6-9+6=3$. If we only add parentheses (and not rearrange the order of the terms), what is the minimum possible value this expression can obtain? (For the purposes of this problem, we cannot change addition or subtraction into multiplication. For example, $ (1+2+3)(-4)+5+6 $ is not a valid placement of parentheses.)

Okay, so I need to figure out the minimum possible value of the expression 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6 by adding parentheses in various places. The catch is that I can't rearrange the order of the terms, only add parentheses to change the grouping, which affects the order of operations. The original expression evaluates to 13, but by adding parentheses, we can change the value. The example given was 1+2+3-(4+5)+6=3. Now, the task is to find the minimum possible value. Let me think through this step by step.

First, let me recall that parentheses change the order in which operations are performed. Since the original operations are all addition and subtraction, which are left-associative, the value is computed from left to right unless parentheses dictate otherwise. By adding parentheses, we can force certain parts of the expression to be evaluated first, which can either increase or decrease the total value depending on how we group the terms.

The expression is: 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6. Let me write down the numbers and operators with their positions:

<prompt_1.1> Identify the numbers and operators in the expression and consider how parentheses can be used to group terms. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
1 [+] 2 [+] 3 [-] 4 [+] 5 [+] 6

So, the numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and the operators between them are +, +, -, +, +. The operators are all binary, so each operation involves two numbers. The original expression is evaluated left to right, so:

1 + 2 = 3

3 + 3 = 6

6 - 4 = 2

2 + 5 = 7

7 + 6 = 13

But if we add parentheses, we can group different parts. For example, in the given example, they grouped 4 + 5 together in the subtraction:

1 + 2 + 3 - (4 + 5) + 6

Which becomes:

(1 + 2 + 3) - (4 + 5) + 6 = 6 - 9 + 6 = 3

So, the strategy here was to subtract a larger number (9) instead of subtracting 4 and then adding 5 separately. That reduces the total.

To get the minimum possible value, I need to maximize the subtraction and minimize the addition. Since subtraction can be used to reduce the total, but the positions of the numbers are fixed, I need to figure out how to group the terms such that as much as possible, large numbers are subtracted, and small numbers are added. However, because the operations are fixed as +, -, +, etc.

Wait, the operations are fixed. Let me check the original expression again:

1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6

So the operations between the numbers are fixed: after 1 is +, after 2 is +, after 3 is -, after 4 is +, after 5 is +. Therefore, we can't change the order of the numbers or the operations; we can only group them with parentheses.

Therefore, the problem is to parenthesize this expression to get the minimal possible value. Let me think about how parentheses can affect each part.

Since subtraction is involved, grouping a subtraction with subsequent additions or subtractions can have different effects.

Let me consider all possible ways to add parentheses and compute the results, then pick the smallest one. However, there are many possible ways to add parentheses, so maybe I need a systematic approach.

First, let me think about the structure of the expression. There are five operators: +, +, -, +, +. So, there are five places where parentheses can be added. However, parentheses must be added around contiguous subexpressions.

Wait, actually, parentheses can be added around any contiguous subexpression, effectively creating a new grouping. For example, in the original expression, we can group 1+2, or 2+3, or 3-4, etc. Each grouping can potentially change the result.

But since the operations are left-associative, the default evaluation is left to right, but with parentheses, we can force different associativities.

To minimize the total, I need to maximize the negative contributions and minimize the positive contributions. So, perhaps grouping the parts that will be subtracted to get large negative numbers, and then adding as little as possible.

Alternatively, since subtraction can turn a positive into a negative, which can then be subtracted again. Hmm, maybe.

Alternatively, think of the expression as a sequence of terms with operators between them:

Term 1: 1

Operator: +

Term 2: 2

Operator: +

Term 3: 3

Operator: -

Term 4: 4

Operator: +

Term 5: 5

Operator: +

Term 6: 6

So, each term is either added or subtracted based on the operator before it. However, when we add parentheses, the sign of a term can change if it's inside a grouped subtraction. For example, in the given example, 4 + 5 is subtracted as a group, so both 4 and 5 are subtracted. Wait, no. Wait, in the example:

1 + 2 + 3 - (4 + 5) + 6

This is equivalent to:

(1 + 2 + 3) - (4 + 5) + 6

Which is 6 - 9 + 6 = 3. So, in this case, the 4 and 5 are both subtracted. So, by grouping 4 + 5 together under a subtraction, both terms are subtracted. Therefore, if we can group terms that are to be subtracted, we can make them contribute negatively. However, in the original expression, the 4 is subtracted, and 5 is added. So, grouping (4 + 5) and then subtracting that group would result in both 4 and 5 being subtracted. Similarly, if we group (4 - 5), that would be subtracted as -1, but since the operator between 4 and 5 is +, we can't have 4 - 5. Wait, the operator between 4 and 5 is +, so we can't form 4 - 5. So, the only way to have a subtraction involving 4 and 5 is if we change the operator, which we can't. Therefore, the original operator after 4 is +, so 4 is subtracted, and 5 is added. So, if we want to subtract 5, we need to have a subtraction operator before it. But in the original expression, the operator before 5 is +, so 5 is added. To subtract 5, we need to have a - operator before it.

Wait, but in the original expression, after 4 is a +, so 4 is subtracted, then 5 is added. So, if we want to subtract 5, we need to somehow change the operator before 5 from + to -, but we can't rearrange the terms, only add parentheses. Therefore, the only way to subtract 5 is if we have a group that includes 5 and a subtraction operator before it. But since 5 is originally added, we need to create a situation where 5 is subtracted. How?

Wait, maybe through grouping multiple terms after 4. Let me think. Suppose we have 4 + (5 + 6). That would be 4 + 11 = 15. But that's adding 4 and 5 and 6. Alternatively, if we have 4 - (5 + 6), but the original operator after 4 is +, so we can't make it a subtraction. Wait, but if we can group terms in such a way that the subtraction is applied to a group that includes 5 and 6. Wait, but how?

Wait, let's parse the original expression with parentheses:

1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6

If we add parentheses around 4 + 5 + 6, it becomes 1 + 2 + 3 - (4 + 5 + 6). That would be 6 - 15 = -9. But is that allowed? The original expression has + before 4, then + before 5, then + before 6. So, if we group 4 + 5 + 6, that's still adding, but if we put it after a subtraction, then yes. Wait, but in the original expression, after 3 is a -, then + before 4. So, if we group 4 + 5 + 6, it's still added. So, 1 + 2 + 3 - (4 + 5 + 6) would be 6 - 15 = -9. But is that a valid placement of parentheses? The problem states that we can only add parentheses, not rearrange the terms. So, as long as we don't change the order, just group consecutive terms. So, grouping 4 + 5 + 6 is allowed, since those are consecutive terms after the subtraction. So that would be a valid grouping.

But in that case, the expression becomes:

1 + 2 + 3 - (4 + 5 + 6) = (1 + 2 + 3) - (4 + 5 + 6) = 6 - 15 = -9. That's a possible value.
-----

But let me check if there's a way to get even lower. For example, if we can create a larger negative number.

Wait, but 4 + 5 + 6 is 15, which when subtracted gives -15. Then 1 + 2 + 3 is 6, so 6 -15 = -9. Alternatively, if we can subtract a larger group. But the only way to subtract a larger group is if we can include more terms in the subtraction. However, the original operators after 4 are +, +. So, after 4, we have +5 and +6. So, the maximum group we can subtract is 4 + 5 + 6. If we subtract that, we get -15. Alternatively, if we can subtract a group that includes 3 - 4, but 3 is added, 4 is subtracted. Wait, let's see.


-----

Another approach: Let's model the expression as a sequence of numbers with operators between them. The expression is:
</execution_1.1>
</Execution_1>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
1 [+] 2 [+] 3 [-] 4 [+] 5 [+] 6

Each operator is either + or -. To minimize the total, we need to maximize the subtraction of large numbers and minimize the addition of small numbers. However, the operations are fixed; we can only group them.

Let me think of the expression as a series of terms:

+1, +2, +3, -4, +5, +6

But with the possibility to group terms together. For example, grouping 1+2 into (1+2), which is still +3, but if we group (1+2+3), that's still +6. Alternatively, if we can group a subtraction with subsequent terms, we can flip their signs.

For example, if we have 1+2+3- (4+5+6), that's 6 - 15 = -9. So, that's a way to subtract a large group.

Alternatively, if we can group in such a way that more terms are subtracted. Let's see.

Original expression:

1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6

If we group 2 + 3 - 4, that would be (2 + 3 - 4) = 1. Then the expression becomes 1 + 1 + 5 + 6 = 13. That's worse.

Alternatively, group 1 + (2 + 3 - 4) + 5 + 6. That's 1 + (1) + 5 + 6 = 13. Still 13.

Alternatively, group 1 + 2 + (3 - 4) + 5 + 6. That would be 1 + 2 + (-1) + 5 + 6 = 1 + 2 = 3; 3 -1 = 2; 2 +5=7; 7+6=13. Still 13.

Alternatively, group (1 + 2 + 3 - 4) + 5 + 6. That's (6 -4)=2; 2 +5=7; 7+6=13. Still same.

Alternatively, group 1 + (2 + 3 - 4 + 5) + 6. Let's compute inside the parentheses: 2 +3=5; 5-4=1; 1+5=6. Then 1 +6 +6=13.

Alternatively, group 1 + 2 + (3 -4 +5 +6). Compute inside: 3-4=-1; -1+5=4; 4+6=10. Then 1+2=3; 3+10=13.

Hmm, seems like all these groupings result in 13. So maybe there's a way to make it lower.

Wait, earlier when I grouped 4 +5 +6 as subtracted: 1 +2 +3 - (4 +5 +6) =6 -15= -9. That's lower. So that's a different way of grouping.

So, the key is to see if we can subtract a larger group. But in the original expression, the operator after 3 is a '-', then after 4 is a '+', so to subtract a group that includes 4,5,6, we need to have the group start right after the subtraction at 3. Let me check.

The original expression is 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6. To subtract 4 +5 +6, we need to have the subtraction operator before 4, which is already there. So, can we group 4 +5 +6 as a single term with the preceding subtraction? That is, 1 +2 +3 - (4 +5 +6). That would be valid because the subtraction after 3 can be extended to include 4 +5 +6. So, yes, that's a valid grouping. Then the result is 6 -15= -9.

Is there a way to get lower than -9? Let's see.

Alternatively, can we subtract a larger group? For example, if we can include 3 -4 as a subtraction. Wait, but 3 -4 is part of the original expression. Let me see. If we group (3 -4) +5 +6. But the original operator after 3 is '-', then after 4 is '+', so if we group (3 -4), that would be -1, then +5 +6. So, (3 -4) = -1; then -1 +5 +6 =10. Then the expression would be 1 +2 + (-1) +5 +6. Wait, but how is that grouped? Let me parse it:

Original: 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6

If we group (3 -4), then it becomes 1 +2 + (-1) +5 +6. Then, if we compute left to right: 1+2=3; 3 + (-1)=2; 2 +5=7; 7 +6=13. Still 13. Alternatively, if we group (3 -4 +5 +6). Let's compute that: 3 -4= -1; -1 +5=4; 4 +6=10. Then the expression becomes 1 +2 +10. Which is 13. So that doesn't help.

Alternatively, if we can subtract a group that includes 1,2,3. For example, group (1+2+3) -4 +5 +6. That's 6 -4=2; 2 +5=7; 7 +6=13. Still 13.

Alternatively, group 1 + (2 +3 -4) +5 +6. That's 1 +1 +5 +6=13.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 + (3 -4 +5) +6. Let's compute inside the parentheses: 3 -4= -1; -1 +5=4. Then the expression is 1 +2 +4 +6=13.

Alternatively, group 1 + (2 +3 -4 +5 +6). Compute inside: 2 +3=5; 5 -4=1; 1 +5=6; 6 +6=12. Then the expression is 1 +12=13.

Alternatively, group (1 +2 +3 -4 +5) +6. Compute inside: 1+2=3; 3+3=6; 6-4=2; 2+5=7. Then 7 +6=13.

Alternatively, group 1 + (2 +3) - (4 +5) +6. Wait, that would be 1 +5 -9 +6= (1+5)=6; 6-9=-3; -3+6=3. Which is the example given. But that's not the minimal.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 + (3 -4) + (5 +6). Compute inside: 3-4=-1; 5+6=11. Then 1+2=3; 3 -1=2; 2 +11=13. Still 13.

Alternatively, group (1 +2) + (3 -4) + (5 +6). That's 3 + (-1) +11=13.

Alternatively, group 1 + (2 +3 -4 +5) +6. As before, that's 1 + (6) +6=13.

Alternatively, group (1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6). That's the entire expression, which is 13.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 +3 - (4 +5 +6). That's 6 -15= -9.

Alternatively, group (1 +2 +3 -4) +5 +6. That's (6 -4)=2; 2 +5=7; 7 +6=13.

Alternatively, group 1 + (2 +3 -4 +5 +6). That's 1 + (8)=9. Wait, 2+3=5; 5-4=1; 1+5=6; 6+6=12. Then 1 +12=13. Hmm, same as before.

Alternatively, group 1 +2 + (3 -4 +5) +6. Compute inside: 3 -4= -1; -1 +5=4. Then 1 +2=3; 3 +4=7; 7 +6=13.
