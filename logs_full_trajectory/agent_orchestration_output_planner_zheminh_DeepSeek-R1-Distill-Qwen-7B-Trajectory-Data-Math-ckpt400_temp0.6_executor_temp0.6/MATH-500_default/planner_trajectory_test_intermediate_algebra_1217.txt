Find the quotient when $x^6 - 3$ is divided by $x + 1.$
</Question>

<think>
<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to find the quotient when \( x^6 - 3 \) is divided by \( x + 1 \). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when dividing polynomials, we can use either polynomial long division or synthetic division. Since the divisor here is \( x + 1 \), which is a linear polynomial, synthetic division might be the quicker method. Let me recall how synthetic division works.

First, synthetic division is used when dividing by a binomial of the form \( x - c \). But here, the divisor is \( x + 1 \), which can be written as \( x - (-1) \). So, the value of \( c \) here is -1. That means I'll be using -1 as the test root in the synthetic division process.

Now, the dividend is \( x^6 - 3 \). Let me note that the dividend is a sixth-degree polynomial, but it's not written out in standard form with all the coefficients. For example, the polynomial is missing the \( x^5 \), \( x^4 \), \( x^3 \), \( x^2 \), and \( x \) terms. So, when setting up synthetic division, I need to account for all the missing terms by using coefficients of 0 for those missing degrees.

Let me write out the coefficients of the dividend in order from the highest degree down to the constant term. The polynomial is \( x^6 + 0x^5 + 0x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x - 3 \). So the coefficients are 1 (for \( x^6 \)), 0 (for \( x^5 \)), 0 (for \( x^4 \)), 0 (for \( x^3 \)), 0 (for \( x^2 \)), 0 (for \( x \)), and -3 (constant term).

Based on execution_1.1:
Setting up synthetic division with root -1 and coefficients [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3]:
-1 | 1   0   0   0   0   0   -3
  |     -1   1  -1   1  -1   1
  ----------------------------
  1  -1   1  -1   1  -1   1   -2

Let me parse this table step by step.

Alternatively, maybe I can verify using polynomial long division. Let's try that as a check.

<prompt_2.2> Perform polynomial long division to verify the result. </prompt_2.2>

Alternatively, another way to check is to use the Remainder Theorem. The Remainder Theorem states that the remainder of the division of a polynomial \( f(x) \) by \( x - c \) is \( f(c) \). Here, we are dividing by \( x + 1 \), which is \( x - (-1) \), so \( c = -1 \). Therefore, the remainder should be \( f(-1) \).

But just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the long division, let me go through the steps again.

Start with bringing down the leading coefficient, which is 1. Then, multiply 1 by -1 to get -1. Add that to the next coefficient (0), resulting in -1. Then multiply -1 by -1 to get 1, add to the next coefficient (0) to get 1. Multiply 1 by -1 to get -1, add to the next 0 to get -1. This pattern continues: multiply by -1 each time and add to the next coefficient. Let's see:

First step: 1 (bring down)
Multiply by -1: 1 * -1 = -1
Add to next coefficient: 0 + (-1) = -1

Next step: Multiply -1 by -1: 1
Add to next 0: 0 + 1 = 1

Next: 1 * -1 = -1
Add to next 0: -1

Next: -1 * -1 = 1
Add to next 0: 1

Next: 1 * -1 = -1
Add to next 0: -1

Next: -1 * -1 = 1
Add to last term: -3 + 1 = -2

So the bottom row after all the steps is [1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -2].

Dividing \( x^6 - 3 \) by \( x + 1 \).

First, set up the division. Divide \( x^6 \) by \( x \) to get \( x^5 \). Multiply \( x + 1 \) by \( x^5 \) to get \( x^6 + x^5 \). Subtract this from the original polynomial:

\( (x^6 + 0x^5 + 0x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x - 3) - (x^6 + x^5) = -x^5 + 0x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x - 3 \).

Next term: Divide \( -x^5 \) by \( x \) to get \( -x^4 \). Multiply \( x + 1 \) by \( -x^4 \) to get \( -x^5 - x^4 \). Subtract:

\( (-x^5 + 0x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x - 3) - (-x^5 - x^4) = x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x - 3 \).

Next term: Divide \( x^4 \) by \( x \) to get \( x^3 \). Multiply \( x + 1 \) by \( x^3 \) to get \( x^4 + x^3 \). Subtract:

\( (x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x - 3) - (x^4 + x^3) = -x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x - 3 \).

Next term: Divide \( -x^3 \) by \( x \) to get \( -x^2 \). Multiply \( x + 1 \) by \( -x^2 \) to get \( -x^3 - x^2 \). Subtract:

\( (-x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x - 3) - (-x^3 - x^2) = x^2 + 0x - 3 \).

Next term: Divide \( x^2 \) by \( x \) to get \( x \). Multiply \( x + 1 \) by \( x \) to get \( x^2 + x \). Subtract:

\( (x^2 + 0x - 3) - (x^2 + x) = -x - 3 \).

Next term: Divide \( -x \) by \( x \) to get -1. Multiply \( x + 1 \) by -1 to get \( -x - 1 \). Subtract:

\( (-x - 3) - (-x - 1) = (-x - 3) + x + 1 = (-3 + 1) = -2 \).

So, the quotient is \( x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x - 1 \) with a remainder of -2. Therefore, when we divide \( x^6 - 3 \) by \( x + 1 \), the quotient is indeed \( x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x - 1 \) and the remainder is -2. This matches the result from synthetic division.

<execution_2.3>
Let's compute \( f(-1) \):

\( f(-1) = (-1)^6 - 3 = 1 - 3 = -2 \). Which matches the remainder we found earlier. That gives me more confidence that the quotient is correct.

But the problem asks for the quotient, not just the remainder. However, in the synthetic division process, we can reconstruct the quotient from the coefficients obtained during the division. Let's recall how synthetic division works. When we perform synthetic division, the bottom row after the division (the last row) gives the coefficients of the quotient polynomial, starting with one degree less than the original polynomial, and the last number is the remainder.

In this case, the original polynomial is degree 6, so the quotient should be degree 5. Looking at the coefficients after division: 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1. These correspond to the terms:

1x^5 + (-1)x^4 + 1x^3 + (-1)x^2 + 1x + (-1)

Which simplifies to:

\( x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x - 1 \)

So, that's the quotient, and the remainder is -2. To write the full division expression, it would be:

\( x^6 - 3 = (x + 1)(x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x - 1) - 2 \)

But the question specifically asks for the quotient. Therefore, the answer should be \( x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x - 1 \).
</execution_2.3>

<execution_2.4>
Divide \( x^6 - 3 \) by \( x + 1 \).

Arrange both dividend and divisor in descending order of degrees. Dividend: \( x^6 + 0x^5 + 0x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x - 3 \). Divisor: \( x + 1 \).

First term: \( x^6 ÷ x = x^5 \). Multiply divisor by \( x^5 \): \( x^5*(x + 1) = x^6 + x^5 \). Subtract this from the dividend:

\( (x^6 + 0x^5 + 0x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x - 3) - (x^6 + x^5) = -x^5 + 0x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x - 3 \).

Next term: \( -x^5 ÷ x = -x^4 \). Multiply divisor by -x^4: \( -x^4*(x + 1) = -x^5 - x^4 \). Subtract:

\( (-x^5 + 0x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x - 3) - (-x^5 - x^4) = x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x - 3 \).

Next term: \( x^4 ÷ x = x^3 \). Multiply divisor by x^3: \( x^3*(x + 1) = x^4 + x^3 \). Subtract:

\( (x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x - 3) - (x^4 + x^3) = -x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x - 3 \).

Next term: \( -x^3 ÷ x = -x^2 \). Multiply divisor by -x^2: \( -x^2*(x + 1) = -x^3 - x^2 \). Subtract:

\( (-x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x - 3) - (-x^3 - x^2) = x^2 + 0x - 3 \).

Next term: \( x^2 ÷ x = x \). Multiply divisor by x: \( x*(x + 1) = x^2 + x \). Subtract:

\( (x^2 + 0x - 3) - (x^2 + x) = -x - 3 \).

Next term: \( -x ÷ x = -1 \). Multiply divisor by -1: \( -1*(x + 1) = -x -1 \). Subtract:

\( (-x -3) - (-x -1) = (-3) - (-1) = -2 \).

So, the quotient is \( x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x -1 \) with a remainder of -2. Therefore, the division can be expressed as:

\( x^6 - 3 = (x + 1)(x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x -1) -2 \).

Therefore, when \( x^6 -3 \) is divided by \( x +1 \), the quotient is \( x^5 -x^4 +x^3 -x^2 +x -1 \) and the remainder is -2. Since the question asks for the quotient, that's the polynomial part of the result.

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Wait, let me check that again. The coefficients after division are 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, and the remainder is -2.
So the quotient should be a fifth-degree polynomial: \( x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x - 1 \), right?

Because the original polynomial is degree 6, and we're dividing by a linear term (degree 1), so the quotient should be degree 5 (6 - 1 = 5). The coefficients we obtained from synthetic division (excluding the remainder) are indeed the coefficients of the quotient polynomial, starting with the highest degree term.

So, putting it all together, the quotient is \( x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x - 1 \) and the remainder is -2. However, since the problem specifically asks for the quotient, we can ignore the remainder.
Therefore, the answer should be \( x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x - 1 \).

Let me verify this result to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

<prompt_3.1> Verify the result of the division by checking the multiplication. </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
One way to verify is to multiply the quotient by \( x + 1 \) and add the remainder to see if we get back the original polynomial \( x^6 - 3 \).

Let's compute \( (x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x - 1)(x + 1) \):

First, distribute each term:

\( x^5 * x = x^6 \)

\( x^5 * 1 = x^5 \)

\( -x^4 * x = -x^5 \)

\( -x^4 * 1 = -x^4 \)

\( x^3 * x = x^4 \)

\( x^3 * 1 = x^3 \)

\( -x^2 * x = -x^3 \)

\( -x^2 * 1 = -x^2 \)

\( x * x = x^2 \)

\( x * 1 = x \)

\( -1 * x = -x \)

\( -1 * 1 = -1 \)

Now, combine all these terms:

\( x^6 + x^5 - x^5 - x^4 + x^4 + x^3 - x^3 - x^2 + x^2 + x - x -1 \)

Simplify by combining like terms:

- \( x^6 \)
- \( x^5 - x^5 = 0 \)
- \( -x^4 + x^4 = 0 \)
- \( x^3 - x^3 = 0 \)
- \( -x^2 + x^2 = 0 \)
- \( x - x = 0 \)
- Remaining term: -1

So, the product of the quotient and divisor is \( x^6 - 1 \). Then, adding the remainder (-2) gives \( x^6 - 1 - 2 = x^6 - 3 \), which matches the original polynomial.

Based on execution_3.1:
Alternatively, maybe I can use the method of equating coefficients. Let me try that approach as another verification.

<prompt_4.1> Use the method of equating coefficients to verify the quotient. </prompt_4.1>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
Suppose the quotient is \( Q(x) = ax^5 + bx^4 + cx^3 + dx^2 + ex + f \) and the remainder is \( R \). Then, we have:

\( x^6 - 3 = (x + 1)(ax^5 + bx^4 + cx^3 + dx^2 + ex + f) + R \)

Expanding the right-hand side:

Multiply each term in the quotient by \( x \) and \( 1 \):

\( ax^6 + bx^5 + cx^4 + dx^3 + ex^2 + fx + ax^5 + bx^4 + cx^3 + dx^2 + ex + f + R \)

Combine like terms:

- \( ax^6 \)
- \( (b + a)x^5 \)
- \( (c + b)x^4 \)
- \( (d + c)x^3 \)
- \( (e + d)x^2 \)
- \( (f + e)x \)
- \( (f + R) \)

This must equal the left-hand side \( x^6 - 3 \). Therefore, we can equate the coefficients:

For \( x^6 \): \( a = 1 \)

For \( x^5 \): \( b + a = 0 \) (since there's no \( x^5 \) term on the left)
Since \( a = 1 \), then \( b + 1 = 0 \) ⇒ \( b = -1 \)

For \( x^4 \): \( c + b = 0 \)
Since \( b = -1 \), \( c - 1 = 0 \) ⇒ \( c = 1 \)

For \( x^3 \): \( d + c = 0 \)
\( c = 1 \), so \( d + 1 = 0 \) ⇒ \( d = -1 \)

For \( x^2 \): \( e + d = 0 \)
\( d = -1 \), so \( e - 1 = 0 \) ⇒ \( e = 1 \)

For \( x \): \( f + e = 0 \)
\( e = 1 \), so \( f + 1 = 0 \) ⇒ \( f = -1 \)

For the constant term: \( f + R = -3 \)
\( f = -1 \), so \( -1 + R = -3 \) ⇒ \( R = -2 \)

Therefore, the quotient coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = -1 \), \( c = 1 \), \( d = -1 \), \( e = 1 \), \( f = -1 \), which gives the quotient polynomial \( x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x - 1 \), and the remainder \( R = -2 \).

Based on execution_4.1:
Just to recap, the key steps were setting up synthetic division with the correct root (-1), accounting for all missing terms by including zeros, performing the synthetic division steps carefully, and then verifying the result through both multiplication and coefficient comparison.
All methods consistently lead to the same quotient and remainder, which gives me confidence that the answer is correct.
