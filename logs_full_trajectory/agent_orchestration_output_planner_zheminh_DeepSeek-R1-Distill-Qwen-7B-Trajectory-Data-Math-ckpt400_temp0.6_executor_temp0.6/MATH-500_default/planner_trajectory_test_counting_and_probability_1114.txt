Okay, so I need to find the probability that the product of two numbers from rolling fair 6-sided dice is a multiple of 5. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem. We have two dice, each with numbers 1 through 6. When we throw them, we get two numbers, and we need the product of these two numbers to be a multiple of 5. The probability should be expressed as a common fraction.

First, I remember that a product being a multiple of 5 means that at least one of the numbers in the product must be a multiple of 5. Because 5 is a prime number, right? So, if either one of the dice shows a 5, then the product will be a multiple of 5. But wait, what if both dice show 5? Then the product is 25, which is still a multiple of 5. So, the key here is that at least one die must show a 5.

But hold on, maybe there's another way to think about this. Instead of directly calculating the probability that at least one 5 is rolled, maybe it's easier to calculate the complementary probability—that is, the probability that neither die shows a 5. Then subtract that from 1 to get the desired probability. Sometimes, complementary probabilities are simpler to compute.

Let me check both approaches to make sure.

First approach: Probability that at least one 5 is rolled. This includes the cases where the first die is 5, the second die is 5, or both are 5. To calculate this, I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

<prompt_1.1> Calculate the probability using the inclusion-exclusion principle as described in the above plan. </prompt_1.1>

Second approach: Calculate the probability that neither die is 5, then subtract from 1. The probability that the first die is not 5 is 5/6, and the same for the second die. Since the dice are independent, the probability that neither is 5 is (5/6) * (5/6) = 25/36. Therefore, the probability that at least one is 5 is 1 - 25/36 = 11/36.

But wait, just to make sure I haven't overlooked anything else. Let me think again.

<prompt_1.2> Verify the solution by considering other possible combinations that result in a product multiple of 5. </prompt_1.2>

Alternatively, let's count the number of favorable outcomes directly. How many outcomes have at least one 5?

<prompt_1.3> Count the number of favorable outcomes directly by considering outcomes with at least one 5. </prompt_1.3>

Alternatively, list all possible pairs where at least one is 5. For the first die being 5, the second die can be any of 6 numbers, so 6 outcomes.

<prompt_1.4> List all possible pairs where at least one die is 5 and verify the count. </prompt_1.4>

The probability that the first die is 5 is 1/6. Similarly, the probability that the second die is 5 is 1/6. But if I just add them together, 1/6 + 1/6, that would be 2/6, but this counts the case where both are 5 twice. So I need to subtract the probability that both are 5. The probability that both dice are 5 is (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36. So, using inclusion-exclusion, the probability is 1/6 + 1/6 - 1/36. Let's compute that: 1/6 + 1/6 is 2/6, which simplifies to 1/3. Then subtract 1/36: 1/3 is 12/36, so 12/36 - 1/36 = 11/36.
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
The product is a multiple of 5 if at least one number is a multiple of 5. Since we have two numbers, each from 1 to 6, the only multiple of 5 possible is 5 itself. So, if either die shows a 5, the product is a multiple of 5. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the probability that at least one die shows a 5. So, this is equivalent to the complement of both dice not showing a 5.
</execution_1.2>

<execution_1.3>
There are 6 outcomes where the first die is 5 (since the second die can be 1-6) and 6 outcomes where the second die is 5 (first die can be 1-6). But wait, that would be 12 outcomes. However, the outcome where both dice are 5 is counted twice here, so we need to subtract 1. Therefore, there are 11 favorable outcomes. Since there are 36 possible outcomes in total, the probability is 11/36.
</execution_1.3>

<execution_1.4>
For the second die being 5, the first die can be any of the remaining 5 numbers (since we already counted when the first die is 5). Wait, no—if we consider ordered pairs, then (5,5) is already included in the first count. So, if we do it directly, the number of favorable outcomes is 6 (for first die 5) + 5 (for second die 5, excluding the already counted (5,5)) = 11. So 11 favorable outcomes out of 36. That matches the previous result.

Based on execution_1.1:
Wait, but let me verify this with another method to be sure. Let's count the number of favorable outcomes directly.

<prompt_2.1> Verify the result by counting the number of favorable outcomes directly. </prompt_2.1>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
If we need at least one 5, then the possible outcomes are:

- First die is 5 and the second die is anything: (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6). That's 6 outcomes.

- Second die is 5 and the first die is not 5: (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (6,5). That's 5 outcomes.

So total favorable outcomes are 6 + 5 = 11. Since there are 36 possible outcomes when rolling two dice, the probability is 11/36.

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1, execution_1.2, execution_1.3, execution_1.4:
Therefore, the probability is 11/36.
I think that's solid. Both methods, direct counting and complementary probability, give the same result.

No prompt to execute.
</Execution_3>

<Final_answer>
Therefore, the probability that the product of the two numbers is a multiple of 5 is $\boxed{\frac{11}{36}}$.
