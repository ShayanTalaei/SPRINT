Okay, so I need to find the smallest positive real number \( a \) such that all roots of the cubic equation \( x^3 + a x^2 + a x + 1 = 0 \) are real. Hmm, let's start by recalling that for a cubic equation, having all real roots means that the graph of the cubic touches the x-axis three times. Since the leading coefficient is positive (1 in this case), the cubic will go from negative infinity to positive infinity, starting from the bottom left and ending at the top right. So, it must have a local maximum and a local minimum. For all roots to be real, the cubic must cross the x-axis three times, which implies that the local maximum must be above the x-axis and the local minimum must be below the x-axis. Therefore, the y-values of the local max and min must straddle the x-axis.

First, maybe I should try to factor the cubic equation. Let's see if that's possible.

Looking at \( x^3 + a x^2 + a x + 1 \), I notice that the coefficients are symmetric in a way: the coefficients of \( x^3 \) and the constant term are both 1, and the coefficients of \( x^2 \) and \( x \) are both \( a \). This symmetry might suggest that the cubic could be a palindrome or have some reciprocal roots.
Let me check if \( x = -1 \) is a root.

<prompt_1.1> Check if \( x = -1 \) is a root of the cubic equation using the symmetry of the coefficients. </prompt_1.1>

But wait, is there a smaller \( a \) possible? Let me check.

Suppose \( a \) is slightly less than 3, say \( a = 2.5 \).
Then, according to our previous analysis, there should be one real root and two complex conjugate roots.

Let's verify by trying to find the roots.

<prompt_1.2> Verify if \( a = 2.5 \) results in all roots being real by finding the roots. </prompt_1.2>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
Plugging \( x = -1 \) into the equation: \( (-1)^3 + a (-1)^2 + a (-1) + 1 = -1 + a - a + 1 = 0. \) Yes, \( x = -1 \) is always a root, regardless of \( a \).
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
Let me use the rational root theorem. Possible rational roots are \( \pm1 \). Testing \( x=1 \): \( 1 + 2.5 + 2.5 +1 =7 \neq 0 \). Testing \( x = -1 \): \( -1 + 2.5 -2.5 +1 = -1 +1 =0 \). Wait, so \( x = -1 \) is a root even when \( a =2.5 \). Then, if \( x = -1 \) is a root, then we can factor it out.

Divide \( x^3 +2.5x^2 +2.5x +1 \) by \( x +1 \). Using polynomial division:

Divide \( x^3 \) by \( x \) to get \( x^2 \). Multiply \( x +1 \) by \( x^2 \) to get \( x^3 +x^2 \). Subtract from the original polynomial:

\( (x^3 +2.5x^2 +2.5x +1) - (x^3 +x^2) = 1.5x^2 +2.5x +1 \).

Now divide \( 1.5x^2 \) by \( x \) to get \(1.5x \). Multiply \( x +1 \) by \(1.5x \) to get \(1.5x^2 +1.5x \). Subtract:

\( (1.5x^2 +2.5x +1) - (1.5x^2 +1.5x) = x +1 \).

Divide \( x \) by \( x \) to get 1. Multiply \( x +1 \) by 1 to get \( x +1 \). Subtract:

\( (x +1) - (x +1) =0 \).

So, the quotient is \( x^2 +1.5x +1 \). Therefore, the polynomial factors as \( (x +1)(x^2 +1.5x +1) \). Now, check the discriminant of the quadratic: \( (1.5)^2 -4*1*1 = 2.25 -4 = -1.75 \). Negative discriminant, so the quadratic has two complex roots. Therefore, when \( a =2.5 \), there is one real root and two complex roots. Hence, \( a =3 \) is indeed the minimal value where all roots are real.

Based on execution_1.1:
Since it's a cubic, we can factor it as \( (x + 1)(x^2 + bx + c) \).
Let me perform the multiplication to find \( b \) and \( c \) in terms of \( a \).

<prompt_2.1> Factor the cubic equation as \( (x + 1)(x^2 + bx + c) \) and find \( b \) and \( c \) in terms of \( a \). </prompt_2.1>
-----

Based on execution_1.2:
Another way to check is to use calculus. Let's compute the derivative of the cubic:

<prompt_2.2> Use calculus to confirm that \( a = 3 \) is the minimal value where all roots are real. </prompt_2.2>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Multiplying \( (x + 1)(x^2 + bx + c) \) gives \( x^3 + (b + 1)x^2 + (c + b)x + c \). Comparing this with the original equation \( x^3 + a x^2 + a x + 1 \), we can equate coefficients:

1. Coefficient of \( x^3 \): 1 = 1, which matches.
2. Coefficient of \( x^2 \): \( b + 1 = a \), so \( b = a - 1 \).
3. Coefficient of \( x \): \( c + b = a \). Since \( b = a - 1 \), this gives \( c + (a - 1) = a \), so \( c = 1 \).
4. Constant term: \( c = 1 \), which matches the original equation.

Therefore, the cubic factors as \( (x + 1)(x^2 + (a - 1)x + 1) \).
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
\( f(x) = x^3 + a x^2 + a x + 1 \)

\( f'(x) = 3x^2 + 2a x + a \)

To find critical points, set \( f'(x) = 0 \):

\( 3x^2 + 2a x + a = 0 \)

The discriminant of this quadratic is \( (2a)^2 - 4*3*a = 4a^2 - 12a = 4a(a - 3) \).

For real critical points, discriminant must be non-negative:

\( 4a(a - 3) \geq 0 \)

Since \( a > 0 \), this inequality holds when \( a - 3 \geq 0 \), i.e., \( a \geq 3 \).

Therefore, when \( a \geq 3 \), the derivative has real roots, meaning the cubic has a local maximum and minimum. If \( a < 3 \), the derivative has no real roots, meaning the cubic is strictly increasing (since the leading coefficient of the derivative is positive, it tends to +infinity as x approaches +infinity and -infinity as x approaches -infinity, but if there's no critical point, it's monotonic). Wait, but if \( a < 3 \), the derivative \( 3x^2 + 2a x + a \) has discriminant negative, so it doesn't cross zero. Therefore, the derivative is always positive or always negative. Since the leading coefficient is 3 > 0, as x approaches infinity, the derivative approaches +infinity, so if there's no real root, the derivative is always positive. Therefore, the cubic is strictly increasing when \( a < 3 \). But a strictly increasing cubic can have only one real root, because it's monotonic. Therefore, when \( a < 3 \), there's only one real root and two complex conjugate roots. Hence, the minimal \( a \) for which all roots are real is 3.

Based on execution_2.1:
Therefore, the quadratic factor is \( x^2 + (a - 1)x + 1 \). For the original cubic to have all real roots, the quadratic must also have real roots. Since the quadratic has real coefficients, its discriminant must be non-negative.
Calculating the discriminant \( D \):

\( D = (a - 1)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times 1 = (a - 1)^2 - 4 \).

<prompt_3.1> Calculate the discriminant of the quadratic factor and determine the condition for it to have real roots. </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
For the quadratic to have real roots, we need \( D \geq 0 \):

\( (a - 1)^2 - 4 \geq 0 \)

Expanding \( (a - 1)^2 \):

\( a^2 - 2a + 1 - 4 \geq 0 \)

Simplify:

\( a^2 - 2a - 3 \geq 0 \)

Factor the quadratic:

\( a^2 - 2a - 3 = (a - 3)(a + 1) \)

So, \( (a - 3)(a + 1) \geq 0 \).

Since \( a \) is a positive real number, \( a + 1 \) is always positive (because \( a > 0 \), so \( a + 1 > 1 > 0 \)). Therefore, the inequality \( (a - 3)(positive) \geq 0 \) simplifies to \( a - 3 \geq 0 \), which means \( a \geq 3 \).

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
Therefore, the minimal value of \( a \) is 3. But wait, let me check this conclusion.

<prompt_4.1> Verify the conclusion by analyzing the conditions for all roots to be real. </prompt_4.1>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
Because if \( a = 3 \), then the quadratic becomes \( x^2 + (3 - 1)x + 1 = x^2 + 2x + 1 \), which factors as \( (x + 1)^2 \). So, the original cubic becomes \( (x + 1)(x + 1)^2 = (x + 1)^3 \), which has a triple root at \( x = -1 \). So, in this case, all roots are real (they are all -1), but they are repeated roots. The problem states "all the roots are real," and since repeated roots are still considered real (with multiplicity), \( a = 3 \) should be the minimal value.

But hold on, let me confirm if there's a possibility that for some \( a < 3 \), the quadratic factor could still have real roots even though the discriminant is negative. But according to the discriminant calculation, if \( a < 3 \), then \( (a - 3) \) is negative, so \( (a - 3)(a + 1) \) is negative (since \( a + 1 > 0 \)), hence the discriminant is negative, meaning quadratic has complex roots. Therefore, for \( a < 3 \), the cubic would have one real root (x = -1) and two complex roots from the quadratic. Therefore, the minimal \( a \) where all roots are real is indeed 3.

<Plan_5>
Based on execution_4.1:
Therefore, the answer should be \( \boxed{3} \).

But let me just verify by plugging in \( a = 3 \) into the original equation.
Then the equation becomes \( x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1 = 0 \). Factoring, as we saw, it's \( (x + 1)^3 = 0 \), so triple root at x = -1, which is real. Therefore, that works. And for any \( a < 3 \), say \( a = 2 \), let's check.

<prompt_5.1> Verify the minimal value of \( a \) by checking the case when \( a = 2 \). </prompt_5.1>
</Plan_5>

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
If \( a = 2 \), the quadratic factor becomes \( x^2 + (2 - 1)x + 1 = x^2 + x + 1 \). The discriminant is \( 1^2 - 4*1*1 = 1 - 4 = -3 < 0 \), so quadratic has complex roots. Therefore, the cubic has one real root and two complex roots. Hence, \( a = 3 \) is indeed the minimal value.
</execution_5.1>
</Execution_5>

<Final_answer>
Thus, the smallest possible value of $a$ is $\boxed{3}$.
