<Question>
If $x^3$ is a positive factor of $10!,$ how many possible integer values of $x$ are there?  (Reminder: For a positive integer $n$, the expression $n!$ stands for the product of the integers from 1 up to (and including) $n$.)
</Question>

<think>
<Plan_1>
Okay, let's try to figure out how many integer values of x there are such that x³ is a positive factor of 10! . Hmm, first, I need to recall what 10! is. 10! means 10 factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to 10. So, 10! = 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1. But maybe instead of calculating the actual number, it's better to factorize it into primes. Prime factorization often helps with problems involving factors.

Let me do that.

None

<prompt_1.1> Execute the prime factorization of 10! as planned. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
Starting with 10! :

Breaking down each number from 10 down to 1 into primes:

- 10 = 2 × 5
- 9 = 3²
- 8 = 2³
- 7 = 7
- 6 = 2 × 3
- 5 = 5
- 4 = 2²
- 3 = 3
- 2 = 2
- 1 = 1 (doesn't affect the product)

Now, let's count the exponents for each prime:

- For prime 2: in 10 (1), 8 (3), 6 (1), 4 (2), 2 (1). Total: 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 8. So 2⁸.

- For prime 3: in 9 (2), 6 (1), 3 (1). Total: 2 + 1 + 1 = 4. So 3⁴.

- For prime 5: in 10 (1), 5 (1). Total: 1 + 1 = 2. So 5².

- For prime 7: only in 7. So 7¹.

Therefore, the prime factorization of 10! is 2⁸ × 3⁴ × 5² × 7¹.

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Now, the problem says x³ is a positive factor of 10! . So, x³ | 10! . Which means that when we factorize x³ into primes, all the exponents in its prime factorization must be less than or equal to those in 10! 's prime factorization.

Let me denote x as a product of primes raised to some exponents.

<prompt_2.1> Define the prime factorization of x and relate it to the condition x³ | 10!. </prompt_2.1>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Let x = 2^a × 3^b × 5^c × 7^d × ... (other primes not in 10! would have exponent 0). Then, x³ = 2^(3a) × 3^(3b) × 5^(3c) × 7^(3d) × ... 

Since x³ divides 10! , each exponent in x³ must be ≤ the corresponding exponent in 10! . So:

3a ≤ 8 (for prime 2)
3b ≤ 4 (for prime 3)
3c ≤ 2 (for prime 5)
3d ≤ 1 (for prime 7)

And for any other prime p (if x had any), 3e ≤ 0, which would mean e = 0. So x cannot have any prime factors other than those in 10! , which are 2, 3, 5, 7.
</execution_2.1>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Therefore, we only need to consider primes 2, 3, 5, 7 for x.

Now, we need to find the number of possible tuples (a, b, c, d) where a, b, c, d are non-negative integers satisfying the above inequalities.

Let's handle each exponent one by one.

<prompt_3.1> Calculate the number of possible values for each exponent a, b, c, d. </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
Starting with a (exponent of 2):

3a ≤ 8 → a ≤ 8/3 ≈ 2.666... Since a must be an integer, the maximum a is 2. So possible a: 0, 1, 2. That's 3 choices.

Next, b (exponent of 3):

3b ≤ 4 → b ≤ 4/3 ≈ 1.333... So b can be 0 or 1. That's 2 choices.

c (exponent of 5):

3c ≤ 2 → c ≤ 2/3 ≈ 0.666... So c can only be 0. That's 1 choice.

d (exponent of 7):

3d ≤ 1 → d ≤ 1/3 ≈ 0.333... So d can only be 0. That's 1 choice.
</execution_3.1>
</Execution_3>

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
Wait, but hold on. If x³ is a factor of 10! , then x itself must be a positive integer. So, x can be 1 or any product of primes with exponents as above.

But let me check if there's a possibility that x could have a prime factor not in 10! . But as I reasoned before, since 10! doesn't have any other prime factors, x³ can't have any primes outside 2,3,5,7. So x can't have any other primes either.

Therefore, the exponents for primes 2,3,5,7 in x must satisfy 3a ≤8, 3b ≤4, etc. So the counts are as above.

Therefore, total number of possible x is the product of the number of choices for each exponent.

<prompt_4.1> Calculate the total number of possible x by multiplying the number of choices for each exponent. </prompt_4.1>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
So:

a: 0,1,2 → 3 choices

b: 0,1 → 2 choices

c: 0 → 1 choice

d: 0 → 1 choice

Total x: 3 × 2 × 1 × 1 = 6.

<Plan_5>
Based on execution_4.1:
Wait, but that seems low. Let me double-check.

<prompt_5.1> Verify the calculation of the total number of possible x. </prompt_5.1>

But let me think again. Is there a case where exponents could be higher if we consider different combinations?

<prompt_5.2> Re-evaluate the calculation of possible x considering different combinations and constraints. </prompt_5.2>

But let me verify with actual examples. Let's list all possible x:

<prompt_5.3> List all possible values of x based on the exponents. </prompt_5.3>
</Plan_5>

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
For example, if x is 1, then x³ is 1, which divides 10! . If x is 2, x³ is 8, which divides 10! (since 10! has 2^8). If x is 4, x³ is 64, which is 2^6. Since 8 divides 64? Wait, no. Wait, x³ must divide 10! . Wait, no, x³ is a factor of 10! , so 10! must be divisible by x³. So x³ | 10! .

So, for example, if x is 2, x³=8=2^3. Since 10! has 2^8, 2^3 divides 2^8, so that's okay. Similarly, x=4=2^2, x³=64=2^6. 6 ≤8, so okay. x=8=2^3, x³=512=2^9. But 9 >8, so 512 does not divide 10! . So x=8 is invalid. Hence, x can be 1,2,4,8? Wait, but according to our earlier calculation, a can be 0,1,2. So x=2^a where a=0,1,2. So x=1,2,4. But wait, x=8 would be a=3, which is 3*3=9>8, so invalid. So that's correct. So a can be 0,1,2. So 3 choices.

Similarly for b: 3^0=1, 3^1=3, 3^2=9. But x³ would be 3^3=27. 10! has 3^4. So 27 divides 10! ? Let's check. 10! = 3628800. Divided by 27: 3628800 ÷27=134400. So yes, 27 divides 10! . So x=3 is allowed. Then x=9: x³=729. 729=3^6. 10! has 3^4. 6>4, so 729 does not divide 10! . Therefore, x=9 is invalid. So b can be 0 or 1. So 3^0 and 3^1. So x=1 and 3. Then, for c: 5^0=1, 5^1=5. x³=125. 10! has 5^2=25. 125=5^3, which is more than 25, so x=5 is invalid. So c must be 0. Similarly, d: 7^0=1, 7^1=7. x³=343. 10! has 7^1. 343=7^3, which is more than 7^1, so x=7 is invalid. So d=0.

Therefore, the possible x values are combinations of 2^a * 3^b where a=0,1,2 and b=0,1. So:

a=0, b=0: 1

a=0, b=1: 3

a=1, b=0: 2

a=1, b=1: 2*3=6

a=2, b=0:4

a=2, b=1:4*3=12

So total 6 values: 1,3,2,6,4,12. Let's check their cubes:

1³=1, divides 10!

2³=8, divides 10!

3³=27, divides 10!

4³=64, divides 10! (since 10! has 2^8 and 3^4, so 64=2^6 and 27=3^3, both exponents are within limits)

6³=216=2^3*3^3, which is okay since 2^3 (a=3 ≤8) and 3^3 (b=3 ≤4)

12³=1728=2^6*3^3, which is 2^6 (6 ≤8) and 3^3 (3 ≤4). 1728 divides 10! ?

Wait, let's check 10! /1728. 10! is 3628800. 3628800 /1728 = 3628800 ÷1728. Let's compute:

1728 × 2000 = 3,456,000 which is more than 3,628,800. Let's try 1728 × 2100 = 1728*2000 +1728*100=3,456,000 +172,800=3,628,800. Exactly. So 1728 ×2100=3,628,800. Therefore, 3628800 /1728=2100. So yes, 1728 divides 10! .

So x=12 is allowed. Thus, total 6 values. So the answer should be 6. But wait, the question says "integer values of x". But since x³ is a positive factor, x must be a positive integer. So negative x would have negative cubes, which are not positive. So only positive x are considered. So 6 positive integers.
</execution_5.1>

<execution_5.2>
Wait, no. Because each exponent in x³ is 3 times the exponent in x, and we have constraints per prime. So for each prime, the exponent in x is floor(exponent in 10! /3). But since exponents have to be integers, we take floor division.

Wait, maybe another way: for each prime, the exponent in x can be 0,1,...., floor(exponent in 10! /3).

Wait, exponent in 10! for prime 2 is 8. So 8 divided by 3 is 2.666...., so floor is 2. So exponents for 2 in x: 0,1,2.

Similarly for prime 3: exponent in 10! is 4. 4/3 ≈1.333, floor is 1. So exponents 0,1.

For prime 5: exponent in 10! is 2. 2/3 ≈0.666, floor is 0. So only 0.

Same for prime 7: exponent in 10! is 1. 1/3 ≈0.333, floor is 0. So only 0.

Therefore, the total number of x is indeed 3 (for 2) ×2 (for3) ×1 (for5) ×1 (for7) =6.

But is that correct? Let's check with actual possible x values.

So x is of the form 2^a *3^b *5^c *7^d where a=0,1,2; b=0,1; c=0; d=0. So possible combinations:

a=0,1,2; b=0,1; c=0; d=0.

So let's list them:

- a=0, b=0: 1

- a=0, b=1: 3

- a=1, b=0: 2

- a=1, b=1: 2*3=6

- a=2, b=0: 4

- a=2, b=1: 4*3=12

So x can be 1,3,2,6,4,12. That's 6 values.
</execution_5.2>

<execution_5.3>
For a: 0,1,2

For b: 0,1

For c and d: 0

So possible combinations:

a=0, b=0, c=0, d=0: x=1

a=1, b=0, c=0, d=0: x=2

a=2, b=0, c=0, d=0: x=4

a=0, b=1, c=0, d=0: x=3

a=1, b=1, c=0, d=0: x=6

a=2, b=1, c=0, d=0: x=12

Are these all?

Wait, but wait. What about x=5? If x=5, then x³=125. But 10! is 3628800. Let's check if 125 divides 3628800.

Prime factors of 125 are 5³. But 10! only has 5². So 5³ does not divide 10! . Therefore, x=5 is invalid. Similarly, x=7: x³=343=7³. 10! has 7¹, so 7³ doesn't divide 10! . So x=7 is invalid. Similarly, x=2×5=10: x³=1000=2³×5³. Again, 5³ is too much. So x=10 is invalid.

So indeed, x cannot have 5 or 7 with exponent greater than 0. Therefore, the only possible x are those where c=0 and d=0. Therefore, the possible x are:

1 (2^0 3^0)

2 (2^1 3^0)

3 (2^0 3^1)

4 (2^2 3^0)

6 (2^1 3^1)

12 (2^2 3^1)

So that's 6 values. Hence, 6 possible x. So the answer is 6?

But wait, hold on. Wait, but x³ must be a factor of 10! . So let me check each x³:

For x=1: 1³=1, which divides everything, including 10! .

x=2: 2³=8. 8 divides 10! ? 10! has 2⁸, so 8=2³ divides 2⁸, yes.

x=3: 3³=27. 10! has 3⁴, so 27=3³ divides 3⁴, yes.

x=4: 4³=64=2⁶. 10! has 2⁸, so 2⁶ divides 2⁸, yes.

x=6: 6³=216=2³×3³. 10! has 2⁸×3⁴, so 2³×3³ divides that, yes.

x=12: 12³=1728=2⁶×3³. Same as above, 2⁶ and 3³ are both less than or equal to 2⁸ and 3⁴, so yes.

So all these x are valid.

But wait, is there another possible x? For example, x=2×3×5=30. Then x³=27000=2³×3³×5³. But 10! has 5², so 5³ doesn't divide, so x=30 is invalid. So indeed, we can't have x with c>0 or d>0.

Therefore, the total number is 6. So the answer is 6.

Based on execution_5.3:
But let me think again. Maybe there's another way to calculate. The number of possible x is equal to the number of cube factors of 10! .

<prompt_6.1> Consider an alternative method to calculate the number of x by finding the number of cube factors of 10!. </prompt_6.1>
</Plan_6>

<Execution_6>
<execution_6.1>
Wait, no. Wait, x³ is a factor of 10! , so x is the cube root of a factor of 10! . But x must be an integer, so x is an integer such that x³ divides 10! . So x is the cube root of a divisor of 10! that is a perfect cube.

Alternatively, the set of x is in bijection with the set of cube factors of 10! , where each cube factor is x³, and x is the cube root. Therefore, the number of x is equal to the number of cube factors of 10! .

Alternatively, the number of cube factors of 10! is equal to the product over each exponent divided by 3, floored and added 1. Wait, perhaps.

Wait, the number of cube factors is the product over each exponent floor(exponent /3) +1. Wait, no. Let me recall that the number of cube factors of a number N with prime factorization N=prod p_i^{e_i} is the product over (floor(e_i /3) +1). Wait, is that correct?

Wait, no. Wait, if we want to find the number of perfect cube factors of N, then for each prime exponent in the factor, it must be a multiple of 3 and less than or equal to e_i. So the number of choices for exponent of p_i is floor(e_i /3) +1. For example, if e_i=8, then possible exponents for cube factors are 0,3,6. So floor(8/3)=2, so 2+1=3 choices. Which matches our previous count for prime 2.

Similarly, for e_i=4 (prime 3): floor(4/3)=1, so 1+1=2 choices (0,3). Wait, but 3*3=9 which is more than 4. Wait, hold on. Wait, if e_i=4, then exponents in cube factors can be 0 or 3. Because 3*1=3 ≤4, but 3*2=6 >4. So exponents 0,3. So two choices. Which is floor(4/3)=1, so 1+1=2. Correct.

Similarly, for e_i=2 (prime 5): floor(2/3)=0, so 0+1=1 choice (only 0). For e_i=1 (prime 7): floor(1/3)=0, so 1 choice (only 0). So the number of cube factors is (3)(2)(1)(1)=6. Therefore, the number of cube factors is 6. Therefore, the number of x is 6, since each cube factor is x³, so x is uniquely determined as the cube root. Therefore, this confirms the previous result.

Therefore, the answer is 6.

But let me confirm once more.

<Execution_7>
<execution_7.1>
The cube factors of 10! are:

1 (1³)

8 (2³)

27 (3³)

64 (4³)

1728 (12³)

and 1 (1³). Wait, but 1 is already counted. Wait, no: the cube factors are 1,8,27,64,1728. Wait, 1,8,27,64,1728. That's 5 cube factors. Wait, but according to our previous calculation, it's 6. Wait, confusion here. Wait, 1,8,27,64,1728. That's 5 numbers. Wait, but according to the exponents, we had 3 choices for a (0,1,2), 2 choices for b (0,1), so 3×2=6. So why are there 6 x's but only 5 cube factors?

Wait, because x=1 corresponds to x³=1, x=2 corresponds to 8, x=3 to 27, x=4 to 64, x=6 to 216, x=12 to 1728. So the cube factors are 1,8,27,64,216,1728. Wait, 216 is 6³. So 216 is 2³×3³. So 216 divides 10! ? Let's check. 10! has 2⁸×3⁴×5²×7¹. So 216=2³×3³. 2³ is okay (3 ≤8), 3³ is okay (3 ≤4). So 216 divides 10! .

So the cube factors are:

1 (1)

8 (2)

27 (3)

64 (4)

216 (6)

1728 (12)

So that's 6 cube factors. Therefore, x can be 1,2,3,4,6,12. So 6 values. Therefore, the number of cube factors is 6, which is equal to the number of x. Therefore, the answer is 6. So the answer is 6.

Therefore, the number of possible integer values of x is 6.

<Execution_8>
<execution_8.1>
The problem states "integer values of x", but since x³ must be a positive factor of 10! , x must be a positive integer. Because if x were negative, x³ would be negative, and 10! is positive, so x³ can't divide 10! as it would be negative. So x must be positive. Therefore, only positive x are considered. So the answer is 6.

But just to make sure, let's check if 1728 divides 10! . As we did earlier, 10! /1728=2100, which is an integer. So yes. Therefore, all the x's are valid.

I think that's thorough. So the answer is 6.
