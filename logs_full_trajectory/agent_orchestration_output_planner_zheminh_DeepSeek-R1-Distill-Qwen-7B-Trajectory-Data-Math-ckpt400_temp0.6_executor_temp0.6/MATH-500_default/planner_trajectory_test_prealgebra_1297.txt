How many zeroes are at the end of $42!$ (42 factorial)?  (Reminder: The number $n!$ is the product of the integers from 1 to $n$.  For example, $5!=5\cdot 4\cdot3\cdot2\cdot 1= 120$.)

Okay, so I need to figure out how many zeros are at the end of 42 factorial, which is written as 42! . I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times the number 10 is a factor in that factorial. Since 10 is 2 multiplied by 5, the number of trailing zeros depends on how many pairs of 2s and 5s are in the prime factorization of 42! . But I also recall that in any factorial, there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the number of 5s will be the limiting factor here. So, essentially, I need to count how many times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42.

Let me start by recalling the method for counting the number of times a prime number divides a factorial. I think it's called Legendre's formula. The formula is that for any prime p and integer n, the exponent of p in the prime factorization of n! is given by the sum of floor(n/p^k) for k from 1 to infinity, until p^k exceeds n. So, in this case, p is 5, and n is 42. Therefore, I need to compute floor(42/5) + floor(42/25) + floor(42/125) + ...

<prompt_1.1> Use Legendre's formula to find the number of times 5 is a factor in 42! by computing the sum of floor(42/5^k) for k from 1 to infinity. </prompt_1.1>

But just to be thorough, maybe I can check by actually computing 42! and see how many zeros it ends with. Although, of course, calculating 42! directly might be tedious, but perhaps I can compute it step by step and keep track of the trailing zeros.

Alternatively, maybe I can use a calculator or a computer to compute 42! and check. Wait, since I can't actually compute 42! here, but maybe I can compute it modulo 10^k for some k to see the trailing zeros.

<prompt_1.2> Explore alternative methods to verify the number of trailing zeros in 42! by using modular arithmetic. </prompt_1.2>

Alternatively, maybe I can check with a smaller factorial to see if my method works. For example, 10! is 3,628,800, which has 2 trailing zeros.

Let's compute each term:

First term: floor(42/5). 42 divided by 5 is 8.4, but since we take the floor, that's 8. These are the numbers divisible by 5: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45... wait, but 45 is more than 42, so up to 40. So that's 8 numbers.

Second term: floor(42/25). 25 is 5 squared. 42 divided by 25 is 1.68, so the floor is 1. These are the numbers divisible by 25: 25 and 50... but 50 is more than 42, so only 25. So that's 1 number contributing an extra 5.

Third term: floor(42/125). 125 is 5 cubed. 42 divided by 125 is 0.336, so the floor is 0. Since this term is 0, all higher terms will also be 0. So we can stop here.

Adding these up: 8 + 1 = 9. So, according to this, there should be 9 trailing zeros in 42! .

Let me see. But maybe that's not necessary since the mathematical reasoning seems sound. However, let's try to compute 42! step by step and see how many trailing zeros we get.

But multiplying all numbers from 1 to 42 would take time. However, maybe I can compute the product step by step, dividing by 10 each time to remove trailing zeros, but that might not be straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps I can note that each time a multiple of 5 is encountered, it contributes to a zero, but also multiples of 25 contribute an extra 5, and so on.

Wait, but actually, the formula already accounts for that. So, the formula gives 8, which is the number of 5s, and since there are more than 8 2s, the number of 10s is 8, hence 8 trailing zeros.

Let's apply the same method. For 10! :

floor(10/5) = 2, floor(10/25) = 0, so total 2. Which matches. For 5! : floor(5/5) =1, floor(5/25)=0, so 1 zero, which is correct (5! is 120). For 15! : floor(15/5)=3, floor(15/25)=0, so 3 zeros. Let's check 15! is 1307674368000, which has 3 trailing zeros.

Based on execution_1.1:
Wait, but let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me go through each step once more.

<prompt_2.1> Re-evaluate the calculations for floor(42/5) and floor(42/25) to verify the result. </prompt_2.1>

Based on execution_1.3:
So, the formula works for smaller factorials, so likely correct for 42! .

Another way to think about it: each time we have a multiple of 5, we add a 5. Multiples of 25 add an extra 5, and so on. So, for 42! , how many multiples of 5 are there?

<execution_2.1>
First, how many multiples of 5 are there between 1 and 42? Every fifth number is a multiple of 5, so 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40. That's 8 numbers, so 8 fives. Then, numbers that are multiples of 25 contribute an additional 5 because 25 is 5*5. In the range 1-42, the multiples of 25 are 25. So that's 1 more five. Then, multiples of 125 would be next, but 125 is 5*25, which is 125, but 125 is greater than 42, so there are no multiples of 125 in this range. Therefore, adding those up: 8 + 1 = 9.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
From 1 to 42, the multiples of 5 are 5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40. That's 8 numbers, so 8 fives. Then, among these, 25 is a multiple of 25 (5^2), so it contributes an extra 5. So that's 1 more, making it 9. So, yes, 8 +1=9.

Therefore, there are 9 trailing zeros. So the answer is 9.

Wait, but let me check with another example. Let's take 25! For example. Then, floor(25/5)=5, floor(25/25)=1, floor(25/125)=0. So total 6. And 25! has 6 trailing zeros. Let me check that. 25! is 15511210043330985984000000. Wait, how many zeros? Let me count: ... 0043330985984000000. So starting from the end, there are 6 zeros. So yes, that works.

Therefore, the same method applies here. So 42! should have 9 trailing zeros. Therefore, the answer is 9.

Therefore, there are $\boxed{9}$ zeros at the end of $42!$.
