Okay, so I need to compute arcsin of -1/2 and express the answer in radians. Hmm, let me start by recalling what the arcsin function does. Arcsin is the inverse of the sine function, right? But since sine isn't one-to-one over all real numbers, the domain of arcsin is restricted to [-π/2, π/2] to make it invertible. That means the output of arcsin will always be between -π/2 and π/2 radians.

Alright, so arcsin(-1/2) is asking for the angle θ in the range [-π/2, π/2] such that sin(θ) = -1/2. Let me think about the unit circle and the sine values.

I remember that sine corresponds to the y-coordinate of a point on the unit circle. So, where is the y-coordinate equal to -1/2?

<prompt_1.1> Identify the angles where the y-coordinate on the unit circle is -1/2. </prompt_1.1>

<execution_1.1>
Let's consider the standard angles. In the first quadrant, sin(π/6) is 1/2, so at π/6, the y-coordinate is 1/2. Similarly, in the fourth quadrant, which is between 0 and -π/2 (but wait, the range of arcsin is up to π/2, so maybe I need to think carefully here).

Wait, the unit circle is divided into quadrants. The first quadrant is 0 to π/2, the second is π/2 to π, the third is π to 3π/2, and the fourth is 3π/2 to 2π. But since arcsin's range is [-π/2, π/2], that covers angles from -π/2 (which is the same as 3π/2) up to π/2. So, negative angles are in the fourth quadrant.

So, if I need a y-coordinate of -1/2, that would be in the fourth quadrant. The reference angle for sin(θ) = 1/2 is π/6. So, in the fourth quadrant, the angle would be -π/6 or equivalently 11π/6. But wait, 11π/6 is in the fourth quadrant, but arcsin's range includes up to π/2, so -π/6 is within the range because -π/2 is -90 degrees and π/2 is 90 degrees.

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Wait, but let me confirm. Let's list the standard angles where sine is 1/2.

<prompt_2.1> Confirm the solution by listing standard angles where sine is 1/2 and considering the range of arcsin. </prompt_2.1>

Let me visualize the unit circle.

<prompt_2.2> Visualize the unit circle to confirm the solution. </prompt_2.2>

But let me make sure there isn't another angle in the range.

<prompt_2.3> Ensure there is no other angle in the range that satisfies the condition. </prompt_2.3>

Alternatively, sometimes people confuse arcsin with arccos, but no, arcsin is specifically the inverse of sine with the restricted domain.

Let me think if there's another way to approach this.

<prompt_2.4> Explore alternative methods to confirm the solution. </prompt_2.4>

Another check: the graph of arcsin is symmetric about the origin because it's an odd function. So, arcsin(-x) = -arcsin(x).
Since arcsin(1/2) is π/6, then arcsin(-1/2) should be -π/6.

Wait, but is that correct?

<prompt_2.5> Re-evaluate the solution using the symmetry of the sine function. </prompt_2.5>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
That's π/6 in the first quadrant. Then in the fourth quadrant, it's -π/6 or 11π/6. But since arcsin's range is from -π/2 to π/2, 11π/6 is equivalent to -π/6 (since 11π/6 - 2π = -π/6). Therefore, the angle we want is -π/6.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
At π/6 (30 degrees), sine is 1/2. That's in the first quadrant. Then, in the second quadrant, sine is also positive, and at 5π/6 (150 degrees), sine is 1/2 as well. Then, in the third quadrant, sine is negative, and at 7π/6 (210 degrees), sine is -1/2. In the fourth quadrant, sine is negative, and at 11π/6 (330 degrees), sine is -1/2.

But since arcsin's range is [-π/2, π/2], the only angles in that interval with sine -1/2 would be -π/6 and -5π/6. Wait, but -5π/6 is less than -π/2, right? Because -5π/6 is -150 degrees, which is less than -90 degrees (-π/2). So, -5π/6 is outside the range. Therefore, the only angle in the range [-π/2, π/2] where sine is -1/2 is -π/6.
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
The sine of π/6 is 1/2, and the sine of 5π/6 is also 1/2. But 5π/6 is in the second quadrant, which is not included in the arcsin range. Similarly, in the third quadrant, sine is negative, but the reference angle would be π/6, so the angle would be π + π/6 = 7π/6, but that's in the third quadrant, which is outside the range of arcsin. 

Wait, arcsin's range is [-π/2, π/2], so the only possible angles are from -π/2 to π/2. So, in terms of negative angles, -π/6 is equivalent to 11π/6, but in terms of the unit circle, -π/6 is the same as rotating 330 degrees clockwise, which is in the fourth quadrant. So, the angle -π/6 has a sine of -1/2.
</execution_2.3>

<execution_2.4>
For example, if I recall that sin(-π/6) = -sin(π/6) = -1/2. Yes, that's right. Because sine is an odd function, so sin(-θ) = -sin(θ). Therefore, sin(-π/6) = -sin(π/6) = -1/2. So that satisfies the equation.
</execution_2.4>

<execution_2.5>
Let me confirm. For example, arcsin(-√3/2) is -π/3, which is consistent with this symmetry. So, yes, if arcsin(1/2) is π/6, then arcsin(-1/2) is -π/6.
</execution_2.5>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1, execution_2.2, execution_2.3, execution_2.4, execution_2.5:
So, putting it all together, arcsin(-1/2) is -π/6.
I think that's solid. All the checks confirm that.

<Final_answer>
Therefore, $\arcsin \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right) = \boxed{-\frac{\pi}{6}}$.
