<Question>
Daniel works at an electronics store, and he claims that the popularity of a television (measured in number of sales) is inversely proportional to its cost. If 15 customers buy a television that costs $\$$1500, according to Daniel's theory, how many customers would buy a television that costs $\$$2500?

Okay, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. So, Daniel says that the popularity of a TV, which is the number of sales, is inversely proportional to its cost. Hmm, inversely proportional... Right, that means if one thing goes up, the other goes down in such a way that their product is a constant. So, if the cost of the TV increases, the number of sales should decrease, and vice versa.

Let me recall what inversely proportional means mathematically.
If two variables are inversely proportional, their product is a constant. So, if we have popularity (let's call that P) and cost (let's call that C), then P * C = k, where k is the constant of proportionality.

So, if we know the popularity and cost of one TV, we can find k, and then use that to find the popularity of another TV with a different cost.

The problem says that 15 customers bought a TV that costs $1500. So, for the first TV, P1 is 15 and C1 is 1500. Then, according to the inverse proportionality, P1 * C1 = k. Let me calculate that. 15 * 1500 = 22500. So, k is 22500.

Now, the question is, how many customers would buy a TV that costs $2500? Let's call that P2. We know that P2 * C2 = k, which is still 22500. So, P2 = k / C2.
Plugging in the numbers, P2 = 22500 / 2500.

Let me compute that. 22500 divided by 2500. Hmm, 2500 goes into 22500 how many times? Let's see, 2500 * 9 = 22500.
So, P2 is 9.

Wait, let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, if the price doubles (from $1500 to $2500), the number of customers should halve if it's inversely proportional.

Wait, no, actually, 2500 is not double of 1500. Let's see, 1500 times 5/3 is 2500. Wait, 1500 multiplied by 5/3 equals 2500? Let me check: 1500 divided by 3 is 500, 500 times 5 is 2500. Yes, so the cost is multiplied by 5/3. Since it's inversely proportional, the number of customers should be divided by 5/3, which is the same as multiplying by 3/5. So, 15 multiplied by 3/5 is 9. That matches the previous result. So, that seems correct.

Alternatively, using the formula P2 = (P1 * C1) / C2 = (15 * 1500) / 2500. Let's compute that again.
15 times 1500 is 22500. Divided by 2500, which is 22500 / 2500. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 100 first: 225 / 25.
25 times 9 is 225, so yes, 9. So that's correct.

So, the answer should be 9 customers.

<Final_answer>
Therefore, according to Daniel's theory, $\boxed{9}$ customers would buy a television that costs $\$$2500$.
