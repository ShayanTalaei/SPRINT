Okay, so I need to factor the polynomial \( x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 \) into irreducible monic polynomials with integer coefficients and then evaluate the sum of each factor evaluated at \( x = 1 \). Hmm, let me start by recalling some factoring techniques. The given polynomial is a quartic in terms of \( x^4 \), so maybe I can treat \( x^4 \) as a single variable. Let me set \( y = x^4 \), which transforms the equation into \( y^2 + 3y - 4 \).

Factoring this quadratic, I look for two numbers that multiply to -4 and add to 3. Let's see, 4 and -1 work because 4 * (-1) = -4 and 4 + (-1) = 3. So, the quadratic factors as \( (y + 4)(y - 1) \). Substituting back \( y = x^4 \), we get \( (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) \).

So, the original polynomial factors into \( (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) \). But now I need to check if these factors can be factored further over the integers.

Based on execution_1.1:
Starting with \( x^4 - 1 \). That's a difference of squares, right?

<prompt_2.1> Factor \( x^4 - 1 \) using the difference of squares as per the above plan. </prompt_2.1>

Now, the other factor is \( x^4 + 4 \). Hmm, this is a sum of squares, but over the integers, sums of squares don't factor into polynomials with integer coefficients in the same way. Wait, but there's a formula for \( x^4 + 4y^4 \), which factors as \( (x^2 + 2xy + 2y^2)(x^2 - 2xy + 2y^2) \). Let me check if that applies here.

<prompt_2.2> Factor \( x^4 + 4 \) using the sum of squares factoring formula as per the above plan. </prompt_2.2>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
So, \( x^4 - 1 = (x^2)^2 - 1^2 = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1) \). Then, \( x^2 - 1 \) can be factored further as \( (x - 1)(x + 1) \). So, \( x^4 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1) \).
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
If we let \( y = 1 \), then \( x^4 + 4 = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2) \). Let me verify that:

Multiply \( (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2) \):
First, \( x^2 * x^2 = x^4 \),
Then, \( x^2 * (-2x) = -2x^3 \),
Then, \( x^2 * 2 = 2x^2 \),
Next, \( 2x * x^2 = 2x^3 \),
\( 2x * (-2x) = -4x^2 \),
\( 2x * 2 = 4x \),
Then, \( 2 * x^2 = 2x^2 \),
\( 2 * (-2x) = -4x \),
\( 2 * 2 = 4 \).

Combine like terms:
\( x^4 + (-2x^3 + 2x^3) + (2x^2 -4x^2 + 2x^2) + (4x -4x) + 4 \).
Simplifies to \( x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x + 4 = x^4 + 4 \). Perfect, that works. So \( x^4 + 4 \) factors into \( (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2) \).

So now, putting it all together, the original polynomial \( x^8 + 3x^4 -4 \) factors into \( (x^4 + 4)(x^4 -1) = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)(x^2 + 1)(x - 1)(x + 1) \).

Wait, but I need to check if these quadratic factors are irreducible over the integers. A quadratic polynomial is irreducible over the integers if it has no integer roots and its discriminant is not a perfect square. For \( x^2 + 1 \), the roots are \( \pm i \), which are not real, so it's irreducible. For \( x^2 - 1 \), wait, no, \( x^2 -1 \) factors further into \( (x -1)(x +1) \).
</execution_2.2>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1, execution_2.2:
Similarly, \( x^2 + 2x + 2 \) and \( x^2 - 2x + 2 \) have discriminants \( (2)^2 - 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4 \), which is negative, so they don't factor over the reals, hence certainly not over the integers. So all these factors are irreducible.

Therefore, the factorization is complete, and the factors are:

<prompt_3.1> List all irreducible factors of the polynomial as per the above plan. </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
1. \( x - 1 \)
2. \( x + 1 \)
3. \( x^2 + 1 \)
4. \( x^2 - 2x + 2 \)
5. \( x^2 + 2x + 2 \)

So there are 5 factors. Now, the problem asks for the sum \( p_1(1) + p_2(1) + \dots + p_k(1) \). Let's compute each \( p_i(1) \):

1. For \( x - 1 \), evaluating at 1 gives \( 1 - 1 = 0 \).
2. For \( x + 1 \), evaluating at 1 gives \( 1 + 1 = 2 \).
3. For \( x^2 + 1 \), evaluating at 1 gives \( 1^2 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 \).
4. For \( x^2 - 2x + 2 \), evaluating at 1: \( 1 - 2 + 2 = 1 \).
5. For \( x^2 + 2x + 2 \), evaluating at 1: \( 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 \).

Adding these up: 0 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 5 = 10.

Wait, but hold on. Let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's start from the beginning.

Original polynomial: \( x^8 + 3x^4 -4 \). Factored into \( (x^4 +4)(x^4 -1) \).
Then, \( x^4 -1 \) factors into \( (x^2 +1)(x +1)(x -1) \). Then \( x^4 +4 \) factors into \( (x^2 +2x +2)(x^2 -2x +2) \). So yes, total factors are those five. Then evaluating each at 1:

First factor: \( x -1 \) at 1 is 0.

Second factor: \( x +1 \) at 1 is 2.

Third factor: \( x^2 +1 \) at 1 is 2.

Fourth factor: \( x^2 -2x +2 \) at 1: 1 -2 +2 = 1.

Fifth factor: \( x^2 +2x +2 \) at 1: 1 +2 +2 =5.

Adding 0 +2 +2 +1 +5: 0+2=2; 2+2=4; 4+1=5; 5+5=10. So total sum is 10.

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
But wait, I have a feeling that maybe the original polynomial can be factored further? Let me check if there are any more factorizations possible.

<prompt_4.1> Verify if the factorization is complete and compute the sum as per the above plan. </prompt_4.1>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
Wait, the original polynomial is degree 8. Let's check the degrees of the factors:

- \( x -1 \): degree 1
- \( x +1 \): degree 1
- \( x^2 +1 \): degree 2
- \( x^2 -2x +2 \): degree 2
- \( x^2 +2x +2 \): degree 2

Total degrees: 1+1+2+2+2 = 8. That's correct. So the factorization is into irreducibles, each monic with integer coefficients. So the answer should be 10.

But let me check if there's another way to factor the original polynomial, perhaps leading to different factors. Let me try another approach.

Alternatively, maybe the original polynomial can be written as a product of quadratics or cubics. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps the original polynomial is a biquadratic equation. Let me check if substituting \( z = x^2 \), then the equation becomes \( z^4 + 3z^2 -4 \). Let me see if this quartic in z can be factored.

Wait, but we already factored the original polynomial in terms of \( x^4 \), so maybe this is the same path as before. Alternatively, perhaps using complex roots, but since we are factoring over integers, complex roots come in conjugate pairs, but since we are looking for integer coefficients, the factors must have real coefficients. But since all the factors are already found, and they are all irreducible over integers, perhaps this is the complete factorization.

Alternatively, let me check if \( x^4 +4 \) can be factored differently. Wait, another way to factor \( x^4 +4 \) is \( (x^4 +4) = (x^4 +4x^2 +4) -4x^2 = (x^2 +2)^2 - (2x)^2 = (x^2 +2x +2)(x^2 -2x +2) \), which is the same as before. So that's the standard factorization.

Another check: Maybe the original polynomial can be factored as a product of a quartic and two quadratics. Let me see if that's possible.

Suppose \( x^8 +3x^4 -4 = (x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 +cx + d)(x^4 + ex^3 + fx^2 +gx + h) \). But this would be a lot more complicated. However, since we already have a factorization into lower-degree polynomials, and since the polynomial is of degree 8, it's possible that this is the complete factorization.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a factorization into a cubic and a quintic, but that seems unlikely because the factors we found are all of degrees that add up to 8, and each factor is irreducible. So I think the factorization is complete as we have it.

Therefore, the sum is 10.

Based on execution_4.1:
Wait, but let me check once more. Let me compute each \( p_i(1) \):

<prompt_5.1> Verify the computation of \( p_i(1) \) and the sum as per the above plan. </prompt_5.1>
</Plan_5>

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
1. \( x -1 \) at 1: 1 -1 = 0.
2. \( x +1 \) at 1: 1 +1 = 2.
3. \( x^2 +1 \) at 1: 1 +1 = 2.
4. \( x^2 -2x +2 \) at 1: 1 -2 +2 = 1.
5. \( x^2 +2x +2 \) at 1: 1 +2 +2 =5.

Adding these: 0 +2 =2; 2 +2=4; 4 +1=5; 5 +5=10. So total 10.

But let me check if there's any other factorization step I might have missed. For example, could \( x^2 +2x +2 \) or \( x^2 -2x +2 \) factor further? Their discriminants are both \( 4 -8 = -4 \), which is negative, so they can't be factored over the reals, hence not over the integers. Similarly, \( x^2 +1 \) factors as \( (x +i)(x -i) \), but those aren't real, so not over integers. So all factors are indeed irreducible over integers.

Therefore, the answer is 10.
