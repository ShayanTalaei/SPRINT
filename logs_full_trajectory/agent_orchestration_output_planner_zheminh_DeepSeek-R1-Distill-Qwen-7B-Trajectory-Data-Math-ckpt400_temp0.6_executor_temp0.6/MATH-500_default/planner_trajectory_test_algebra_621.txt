Okay, let's see. I need to convert the quadratic equation x² + 2.6x + 3.6 into the form (x + b)² + c. Then find the sum of b and c as a decimal. Hmm, right. So this is about completing the square, right? Let me recall how that works.

<prompt_1.1> Identify the method needed to convert the quadratic equation into vertex form. </prompt_1.1>

<execution_1.1>
Alright, completing the square. The standard form is ax² + bx + c, and here we need to write it in vertex form, which is (x + b)² + c. Wait, actually, the vertex form is usually written as a(x - h)² + k, but in this case, the problem specifies (x + b)² + c. So that would mean the coefficient a is 1 here, which matches our original equation since the coefficient of x² is 1. So we don't have to worry about factoring out a coefficient other than 1.

Alright, so the process is to take the quadratic term and the linear term, group them, and then complete the square. Let's write down the original equation again: x² + 2.6x + 3.6. To complete the square, we need to take the coefficient of x, which is 2.6, divide it by 2, square it, and add and subtract that value inside the equation. Wait, but since we're converting to the form (x + b)² + c, the constant term c will account for the difference between the original quadratic and the perfect square trinomial.

Based on execution_1.1:
Let me start step by step.

<prompt_2.1> Follow the above plan to complete the square for the quadratic equation. </prompt_2.1>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
First, take the quadratic: x² + 2.6x. The coefficient of x is 2.6. To complete the square, we take half of 2.6, which is 1.3, and then square it. So (1.3)² is... let me calculate that. 1.3 times 1.3. 1 times 1 is 1, 1 times 0.3 is 0.3, 0.3 times 1 is 0.3, and 0.3 times 0.3 is 0.09. Adding those up: 1 + 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.09 = 1.69. So (1.3)² = 1.69.

So, if we add 1.69 inside the equation to complete the square, we have to also subtract it to balance the equation. Wait, but in the original quadratic, we have x² + 2.6x + 3.6. So if we group x² + 2.6x, we can write it as (x + 1.3)² - 1.69 + 3.6. Let me verify that.

</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Expanding (x + 1.3)² gives x² + 2.6x + 1.69. So if we have (x + 1.3)², that's x² + 2.6x + 1.69. But the original quadratic only has x² + 2.6x + 3.6. So the difference between the constant terms is 3.6 - 1.69.
Let's compute that. 3.6 minus 1.69. 3.6 is the same as 3.60. 3.60 - 1.69: 3 - 1 is 2, 0.60 - 0.69. Hmm, that's tricky. 0.60 - 0.69 is -0.09. So 2 - 0.09 is 1.91. Wait, no. Wait, 3.60 minus 1.69: subtract 1 from 3.60, you get 2.60. Then subtract 0.69 from 2.60.

<prompt_3.1> Verify the calculation of the new constant term after completing the square. </prompt_3.1>

Wait, but let me check if this is correct. Let's expand (x + 1.3)² + 1.91 and see if it gives the original quadratic.

<prompt_3.2> Expand (x + 1.3)² + 1.91 to verify it matches the original quadratic. </prompt_3.2>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
So 2.60 - 0.69. 2 - 0 is 2, 0.60 - 0.69. Hmm, 0.60 is less than 0.69, so we need to borrow 1 from the 2, making it 1 and 1.60. Then 1.60 - 0.69 is 0.91. So total is 1.91. Wait, that seems right. Let me check with decimal subtraction.

Alternatively, 1.69 + 1.91 = 3.60. Yes, because when you add 1.69 + 1.91, you get 3.60.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
(x + 1.3)² is x² + 2.6x + 1.69. Adding 1.91 gives x² + 2.6x + 1.69 + 1.91 = x² + 2.6x + 3.6. Yes, that's correct.
</execution_3.2>
</Execution_3>

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
Therefore, the original quadratic can be written as (x + 1.3)² + 1.91. Therefore, b is 1.3 and c is 1.91. So b + c is 1.3 + 1.91.
Let me add those. 1 + 1 is 2, 0.3 + 0.91 is 1.21. So 2 + 1.21 is 3.21. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 1.3 + 1.91. Let's line them up:

<prompt_4.1> Calculate and verify the sum of b and c. </prompt_4.1>

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the sign when completing the square. Let me check again.

<prompt_4.2> Re-evaluate the completion of the square to ensure accuracy. </prompt_4.2>

Based on execution_3.2:
Therefore, the answer is 3.21. But let me just make sure there are no calculation errors. Let me go through the steps again.

1.3
+1.91
------
Starting from the right: 0 + 1 is 1. Then 3 + 9 is 12. Carry over 1. 1 + 1 is 2, plus the carried over 1 makes 3. So it's 3.21. Wait, but 1.3 + 1.91 is 3.21? Let me check with decimal addition. 1.3 is the same as 1.30. 1.30 + 1.91. 1 + 1 = 2, 0.30 + 0.91 = 1.21. So 2 + 1.21 = 3.21. Yes, that's correct.
</execution_4.1>

<execution_4.2>
1.3 is the same as 1.30. 1.30 + 1.91. Adding the hundredths: 0 + 0 = 0. Tenths: 3 + 9 = 12, so carryover 1. Units: 1 + 1 + 1 (carryover) = 3. So total is 3.21. So yes, 3.21.
</execution_4.2>

<execution_4.3>
Original quadratic: x² + 2.6x + 3.6.

To complete the square:

Take the coefficient of x, which is 2.6, divide by 2: 1.3. Square it: 1.3² = 1.69.

So, (x + 1.3)² = x² + 2.6x + 1.69.

Original constant term is 3.6. So to get from the perfect square to the original quadratic, we need to add 3.6 - 1.69 = 1.91. Therefore, the quadratic can be written as (x + 1.3)² + 1.91. Therefore, b = 1.3 and c = 1.91. Adding them together: 1.3 + 1.91 = 3.21.

Based on execution_4.1:
But wait, the problem says "as a decimal".
3.21 is already a decimal, so that's the answer. Hmm.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
Starting with x² + 2.6x + 3.6. To complete the square, take half of 2.6, which is 1.3. Square that, get 1.69. Then the square is (x + 1.3)² = x² + 2.6x + 1.69. Therefore, to get the original quadratic, we have (x + 1.3)² + (3.6 - 1.69) = (x + 1.3)² + 1.91. So yes, c is 1.91. Then b is 1.3, so sum is 1.3 + 1.91 = 3.21.

<Final_answer>
Therefore, $b + c = \boxed{3.21}$.
