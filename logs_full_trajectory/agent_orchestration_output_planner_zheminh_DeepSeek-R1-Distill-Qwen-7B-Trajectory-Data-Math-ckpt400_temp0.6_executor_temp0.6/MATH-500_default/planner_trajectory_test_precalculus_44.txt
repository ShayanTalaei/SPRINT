Okay, so I need to find the least positive angle θ in degrees where the tangent of θ is equal to this big expression. The expression is a fraction with a numerator and a denominator, both of which are combinations of cosines and sines of different angles. Hmm, this seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify both the numerator and the denominator using trigonometric identities. Let me start by looking at the numerator.

The numerator is cos5° cos20° + cos35° cos50° - sin5° sin20° - sin35° sin50°. Hmm, I remember that there are product-to-sum formulas for cosine and sine products. Let me recall them:

For cos A cos B, the identity is (1/2)[cos(A+B) + cos(A-B)]. Similarly, sin A sin B is (1/2)[cos(A-B) - cos(A+B)]. Wait, but here we have cos A cos B minus sin A sin B. That actually looks like the formula for cos(A + B), right? Because cos(A + B) = cos A cos B - sin A sin B. So maybe each pair in the numerator can be combined using that identity.

Let me check:

First term: cos5° cos20° - sin5° sin20°. That would be cos(5° + 20°) = cos25°. Similarly, the second part is cos35° cos50° - sin35° sin50°, which is cos(35° + 50°) = cos85°. So the numerator simplifies to cos25° + cos85°.

Wait, but the original numerator is cos5° cos20° + cos35° cos50° - sin5° sin20° - sin35° sin50°. So grouping the first two terms and the last two terms, we have (cos5° cos20° - sin5° sin20°) + (cos35° cos50° - sin35° sin50°) = cos25° + cos85°. So numerator simplifies to cos25° + cos85°.

Based on execution_1.1:
Now, maybe I can combine these two cosines into a single term. There's an identity for cos A + cos B. Let me recall: cos A + cos B = 2 cos[(A+B)/2] cos[(A-B)/2]. Let's apply that here.

<prompt_2.1> Simplify the combined cosine terms using the identity for the sum of cosines. </prompt_2.1>

Now moving on to the denominator: sin5° cos20° - sin35° cos50° + cos5° sin20° - cos35° sin50°. Let's see. Maybe group terms similarly. Let's group the first two terms and the last two terms:

But maybe there's a way to simplify even more? Let me check if there's another approach.

Alternatively, maybe instead of simplifying numerator and denominator separately, see if the whole expression is a tangent of some angle. But given that we have tanθ = [cos25 + cos85]/[sin15 + sin(-35)].

Alternatively, let's compute the numerical values to check. Maybe that can give insight.

<prompt_2.3> Verify the simplified expression by computing the numerical values of the original and simplified expressions. </prompt_2.3>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Here, A is 25° and B is 85°, so (A+B)/2 = 110°/2 = 55°, and (A-B)/2 = (-60°)/2 = -30°. But cosine is even, so cos(-30°) = cos30°. Therefore, cos25° + cos85° = 2 cos55° cos30°. So numerator is 2 cos55° cos30°.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
[sin5° cos20° + cos5° sin20°] - [sin35° cos50° + cos35° sin50°]. Wait, these look like sine addition formulas. Because sin(A + B) = sin A cos B + cos A sin B. So:

First group: sin5° cos20° + cos5° sin20° = sin(5° + 20°) = sin25°.

Second group: sin35° cos50° + cos35° sin50° = sin(35° + 50°) = sin85°.

But in the denominator, it's [sin5 cos20 + cos5 sin20] - [sin35 cos50 + cos35 sin50] = sin25 - sin85. So denominator simplifies to sin25° - sin85°.

Again, maybe combine these two sine terms. There's an identity for sin A - sin B = 2 cos[(A+B)/2] sin[(A-B)/2]. Let's apply that:

sin25° - sin85° = 2 cos[(25 + 85)/2] sin[(25 - 85)/2] = 2 cos(55°) sin(-30°) = 2 cos55° (-1/2) = -cos55°. But since sin is odd, sin(-θ) = -sinθ, so this becomes -cos55°.

Wait, but let me verify:

sin A - sin B = 2 cos[(A+B)/2] sin[(A - B)/2]

So A =25°, B=85°, so (A+B)/2 =55°, (A - B)/2= -30°, so sin[(A - B)/2] = sin(-30°) = -1/2.

Thus, 2 cos55° * (-1/2) = -cos55°, so denominator is -cos55°, which is equivalent to cos(180° - 55°) = cos125°, but since cosine is even, cos125° = -cos55°. So denominator is -cos55°.

Compute numerator: cos25 + cos85.

cos25 ≈ 0.9063, cos85 ≈ 0.06699, so sum ≈ 0.9063 + 0.06699 ≈ 0.9733.

Denominator: sin15 + sin(-35) = sin15 - sin35.

sin15 ≈ 0.2588, sin35 ≈ 0.5736, so sin15 - sin35 ≈ 0.2588 - 0.5736 ≈ -0.3148.

Therefore, tanθ ≈ 0.9733 / (-0.3148) ≈ -3.100.

But since we need the least positive angle θ, and tangent is negative here, that would mean θ is in a quadrant where tangent is negative. Tangent is negative in second and fourth quadrants. But since we are looking for the least positive angle, θ would be 180° - arctan(3.100) or 360° - arctan(3.100). Let's compute arctan(3.100).

arctan(3.100) is approximately 72°, since tan72 ≈ 3.077, which is close to 3.100. So arctan(3.100) ≈ 72.2°. Therefore, θ ≈ 180° - 72.2° ≈ 107.8°, or 360° - 72.2° ≈ 287.8°. Since we need the least positive angle, 107.8° is the answer.

Based on execution_2.1, execution_2.2:
So putting numerator and denominator together, tanθ = [2 cos55° cos30°] / [-cos55°] = [2 cos30°] / [-1] = -2 cos30°. The cos55° cancels out, so we have -2 cos30°. But cos30° is √3/2, so this becomes -2*(√3/2) = -√3.

So tanθ = -√3. But we need the least positive angle θ where this holds. However, tangent is negative in the second and fourth quadrants. The reference angle for tanθ = √3 is 60°, since tan60° = √3. Therefore, in the second quadrant, θ = 180° - 60° = 120°, and in the fourth quadrant, θ = 360° - 60° = 300°.

<prompt_3.1> Determine the least positive angle θ for which tan θ equals the simplified expression. </prompt_3.1>
-----

Alternatively, since tanθ is negative, θ could be 180° - 60° = 120°, or 360° - 60° = 300°, but since we want the least positive angle, 120° is smaller than 300°, so the answer is 120°. Wait, but let me confirm once more.

<prompt_3.2> Confirm the smallest positive angle θ for which tan θ is negative. </prompt_3.2>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
Since we need the least positive angle, the smallest one is 120°, right? Because 120° is less than 300°, but wait, 120° is the first positive angle where tangent is negative. Wait, but 120° is the angle in the second quadrant where tangent is negative. Alternatively, if we consider negative angles, but the problem specifies the least positive angle. So 120° is the answer.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
If tanθ = -√3, then θ is in the second or fourth quadrant. The principal value for arctan(-√3) is -60°, but since we need positive angles, we can add 180° to get 120°, or add 360° - 60° = 300°. So the least positive angle is 120°, since 120° is less than 300°.

But wait, let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake, because sometimes signs can be tricky.

<execution_4.1>
Starting with the numerator: cos5 cos20 + cos35 cos50 - sin5 sin20 - sin35 sin50. Grouped as (cos5 cos20 - sin5 sin20) + (cos35 cos50 - sin35 sin50) = cos25 + cos85. That seems correct. Then combined into 2 cos55 cos30. Denominator: sin5 cos20 + cos5 sin20 - sin35 cos50 - cos35 sin50. Grouped as (sin5 cos20 + cos5 sin20) - (sin35 cos50 + cos35 sin50) = sin25 - sin85. Then sin25 - sin85 = -cos55. So denominator is -cos55. Then tanθ = (2 cos55 cos30)/(-cos55) = -2 cos30 = -√3. So yes, that's correct. So tanθ = -√3. The positive angles where tangent is -√3 are 120° and 300°, so the least one is 120°.

Based on execution_4.1:
Wait, but let me check if there's a possibility that during simplification, I missed a sign or something. Let's verify the denominator again.

<prompt_5.1> Re-verify the steps and confirm the least positive angle θ. </prompt_5.1>
</Plan_5>

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
Original denominator: sin5 cos20 - sin35 cos50 + cos5 sin20 - cos35 sin50. Let's rearrange terms: (sin5 cos20 + cos5 sin20) - (sin35 cos50 + cos35 sin50). That is sin(5+20) - sin(35+50) = sin25 - sin85. Then sin25 - sin85. Since sin85 is greater than sin25 (as 85° is in the second quadrant where sine is decreasing from 90°), so sin85 ≈ 0.9962, sin25 ≈ 0.4226, so sin25 - sin85 ≈ -0.5736. Then, using the identity sin A - sin B = 2 cos[(A+B)/2] sin[(A-B)/2]. So (25 + 85)/2 = 55°, (25 -85)/2 = -30°, so 2 cos55 sin(-30) = 2 cos55 (-1/2) = -cos55. So yes, that's correct. So denominator is -cos55. Then numerator is 2 cos55 cos30. So tanθ = (2 cos55 cos30)/(-cos55) = -2 cos30 = -√3. So that's correct. Then θ is 120°, which is 180° - 60°, since tan60° = √3, so tan120° = tan(180° -60°) = -tan60° = -√3. So yes, that's correct. Therefore, the least positive angle is 120°.
