Okay, let's see. I need to find the sixth term of an arithmetic sequence where the fourth term is 200 and the eighth term is 500. Hmm, arithmetic sequences... right, they have a common difference between consecutive terms. Let me recall the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence. I think it's a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d, where a_1 is the first term and d is the common difference.
So, each term is the first term plus (n-1) times the common difference.

Given that the fourth term is 200, that would be a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200. And the eighth term is 500, so a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500. So, I have two equations here:

1. a_1 + 3d = 200
2. a_1 + 7d = 500

I need to solve these two equations to find a_1 and d, and then use them to find the sixth term, which would be a_6 = a_1 + 5d.

Let me subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate a_1.

But let me think again. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to find the sixth term without finding a_1 and d explicitly. Let's see. The fourth term is 200, the eighth term is 500. The sixth term is two terms away from the fourth term and two terms away from the eighth term. Since it's an arithmetic sequence, the terms are linear, so maybe the sixth term is the average of the fourth and eighth terms?

<prompt_1.2> Consider if the sixth term can be found as the average of the fourth and eighth terms. </prompt_1.2>

But let me confirm that. Let's think in terms of positions. From the fourth term to the eighth term, that's four positions apart. But the sixth term is two positions from the fourth and two positions from the eighth. Since the common difference is 75, each term increases by 75.

<prompt_1.3> Confirm the sixth term by considering the common difference and positions from the fourth and eighth terms. </prompt_1.3>

<execution_1.1>
So, (a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200. Simplifying the left side: a_1 - a_1 + 7d - 3d = 4d. And the right side is 300. So, 4d = 300. Therefore, d = 300 / 4 = 75.

Let me check.

If the fourth term is 200, then each subsequent term increases by d. So, term 4: 200, term 5: 200 + d, term 6: 200 + 2d, term 7: 200 + 3d, term 8: 200 + 4d. Wait, but according to the given, term 8 is 500. So, term 8 is 200 + 4d = 500. Then 4d = 300, so d = 75. Then term 6 would be 200 + 2*75 = 350. Alternatively, term 6 is term 4 + 2d = 200 + 150 = 350.

<execution_1.3>
So, from the fourth term to the sixth term is two steps: 200 + 75 + 75 = 200 + 150 = 350. Alternatively, from the eighth term, subtract two steps: 500 - 75 -75 = 500 - 150 = 350. So that's another way to see it. But in an arithmetic sequence, the term exactly in the middle of two terms can be found by averaging if the number of terms between them is even. Wait, the fourth and eighth terms: the sixth term is the midpoint between them. Let me check. The fourth term is 200, eighth is 500. The difference is 300 over four terms. So each term increases by 300/4 = 75. So yes, each term increases by 75. Therefore, starting from the fourth term (200), adding two terms (75 each) gives 200 + 150 = 350. Similarly, subtracting two terms from the eighth term: 500 - 150 = 350.

Based on execution_1.1:
Now, substitute d = 75 into one of the equations to find a_1. Let's use the first equation: a_1 + 3*75 = 200.
Calculating 3*75: 3*70=210, 3*5=15, so 210+15=225. So, a_1 + 225 = 200. Therefore, a_1 = 200 - 225 = -25.

Wait, the first term is negative? That's okay, right? Arithmetic sequences can have negative terms. Let me check if this makes sense.
If a_1 is -25 and d is 75, then let's compute the fourth term: a_4 = -25 + 3*75 = -25 + 225 = 200. That's correct. The eighth term would be -25 + 7*75 = -25 + 525 = 500. That also checks out.

Now, to find the sixth term, a_6 = a_1 + 5d. Plugging in the values: -25 + 5*75.
Calculating 5*75: 375. Then, -25 + 375 = 350.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to find the sixth term without finding a_1 and d explicitly. Let me think.
Since the fourth term is 200 and the eighth term is 500, the sixth term is two terms after the fourth term and two terms before the eighth term. Since the common difference is 75, each term increases by 75. So from term 4 to term 6, we add 2d, which is 150. So 200 + 150 = 350. Similarly, from term 8 to term 6, subtract 2d: 500 - 150 = 350.

But just to make sure I didn't skip any steps, let me retrace. The problem gives two terms of an arithmetic sequence: the 4th term is 200, the 8th term is 500. Need to find the 6th term. Arithmetic sequence formula is linear, so we can set up equations.

Another way: Since term 8 is term 4 plus 4d. So 200 + 4d = 500. Therefore, 4d = 300, d=75. Then term 6 is term 4 plus 2d: 200 + 150=350. Yep, same result. So all methods lead to 350.

<Final_answer>
Therefore, the sixth term of the arithmetic sequence is $\boxed{350}$.
