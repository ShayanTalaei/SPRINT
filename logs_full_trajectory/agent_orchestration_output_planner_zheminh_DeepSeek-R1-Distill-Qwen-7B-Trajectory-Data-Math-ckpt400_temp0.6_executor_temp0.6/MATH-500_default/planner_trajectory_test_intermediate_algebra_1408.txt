Okay, so I need to find z^85 + 1/z^85 given that z + 1/z = (1 + sqrt(5))/2. Hmm, complex numbers can sometimes be tricky, but maybe there's a pattern or a recurrence relation I can use here. Let me think step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with expressions like z + 1/z, it often relates to roots of unity or trigonometric identities. For example, if z is on the unit circle in the complex plane, then 1/z is the conjugate of z, so z + 1/z would be 2*cos(theta), where theta is the argument of z. Let me check if that's applicable here.

Let me compute the right-hand side: (1 + sqrt(5))/2. That's actually the golden ratio, often denoted by phi (φ), which is approximately 1.618. But wait, cosine of a real number can't exceed 1 or be less than -1. However, here we have z + 1/z equal to a number greater than 1. That suggests that z is not on the unit circle, because if it were, z + 1/z would be 2*cos(theta), which is between -2 and 2. Wait, but 2*cos(theta) can't be more than 2 or less than -2. However, (1 + sqrt(5))/2 is approximately 1.618, which is less than 2, so actually, it's possible. Wait, 2*cos(theta) = (1 + sqrt(5))/2 would imply cos(theta) = (1 + sqrt(5))/4, which is approximately 0.4045, which is valid because it's between -1 and 1. So theta = arccos((1 + sqrt(5))/4). Hmm, so maybe z is e^(i*theta) with theta as above. But let me confirm.

Alternatively, maybe z is a root of the equation z + 1/z = phi, which can be rewritten as z^2 - phi*z + 1 = 0. Let's solve this quadratic equation. The roots would be [phi ± sqrt(phi^2 - 4)]/2. Let's compute phi^2: phi is (1 + sqrt(5))/2, so phi^2 = [(1 + sqrt(5))/2]^2 = (1 + 2*sqrt(5) + 5)/4 = (6 + 2*sqrt(5))/4 = (3 + sqrt(5))/2. Then phi^2 - 4 = (3 + sqrt(5))/2 - 4 = (3 + sqrt(5) - 8)/2 = (-5 + sqrt(5))/2. So sqrt(phi^2 - 4) would be sqrt[(-5 + sqrt(5))/2].

Based on execution_1.1:
Hmm, that's a complex number. So the roots z are complex numbers not on the unit circle. Wait, but if z is a root of z^2 - phi*z + 1 = 0, then multiplying both sides by z gives z^3 - phi*z^2 + z = 0, but maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use recurrence relations for powers of z + 1/z. I remember that for such expressions, there's a way to express z^n + 1/z^n in terms of previous terms. Let me recall the formula.

<prompt_2.1> Recall and verify the recurrence relation for z^n + 1/z^n. </prompt_2.1>
-----

But let me verify this with another approach to be sure. Let's consider that z satisfies the equation z + 1/z = phi. Let's denote S_n = z^n + 1/z^n. Then, as per the recurrence relation, S_{n+1} = phi*S_n - S_{n-1}. We have S_0 = 2, S_1 = phi, and then each subsequent term is computed as phi*S_n - S_{n-1}.

<prompt_2.2> Use the recurrence relation to compute S_2 to S_8 to verify the results. </prompt_2.2>

Alternatively, maybe there's a matrix exponentiation method or using eigenvalues. But perhaps another way is to note that since z satisfies z + 1/z = phi, then z^2 = phi*z - 1. Therefore, any higher power of z can be expressed in terms of z and 1. Let's try to compute the first few S_n terms to see if there's a pattern.

If S_n = z^n + 1/z^n, then we have the recurrence S_{n+1} = S_n * S_1 - S_{n-1}. Because z^{n+1} + 1/z^{n+1} = (z^n + 1/z^n)(z + 1/z) - (z^{n-1} + 1/z^{n-1}).

Let's compute S_2: S_2 = phi*S_1 - S_0 = phi*phi - 2 = phi^2 - 2. But earlier, we found that phi^2 = (3 + sqrt(5))/2, so S_2 = (3 + sqrt(5))/2 - 2 = (3 + sqrt(5) - 4)/2 = (-1 + sqrt(5))/2. Which matches what we had earlier.

Similarly, S_3 = phi*S_2 - S_1 = phi*(-1 + sqrt(5))/2 - phi. Let's compute that. First, phi*(-1 + sqrt(5))/2 = [(1 + sqrt(5))/2]*(-1 + sqrt(5))/2. Let me compute that product:

(1 + sqrt(5))(-1 + sqrt(5))/4 = [(-1)(1) + (-1)(sqrt(5)) + sqrt(5)(1) + sqrt(5)(sqrt(5))]/4 = [-1 - sqrt(5) + sqrt(5) + 5]/4 = (-1 + 5)/4 = 4/4 = 1. So S_3 = 1 - phi. Since phi = (1 + sqrt(5))/2, so 1 - phi = (2 - 1 - sqrt(5))/2 = (1 - sqrt(5))/2. That's correct, as we found earlier.

Similarly, S_4 = phi*S_3 - S_2 = phi*(1 - sqrt(5))/2 - (-1 + sqrt(5))/2. Let's compute that. First term: phi*(1 - sqrt(5))/2 = [(1 + sqrt(5))/2]*(1 - sqrt(5))/2. Multiply numerator: (1 + sqrt(5))(1 - sqrt(5)) = 1 - 5 = -4. So this term is (-4)/4 = -1. Then subtract S_2: -(-1 + sqrt(5))/2 = (1 - sqrt(5))/2. So S_4 = -1 + (1 - sqrt(5))/2 = (-2 + 1 - sqrt(5))/2 = (-1 - sqrt(5))/2. Which is correct.

Continuing, S_5 = phi*S_4 - S_3 = phi*(-1 - sqrt(5))/2 - (1 - sqrt(5))/2. Compute phi*(-1 - sqrt(5))/2: [(1 + sqrt(5))/2]*(-1 - sqrt(5))/2. Multiply numerator: -(1 + sqrt(5)) - (1 + sqrt(5))sqrt(5) = -1 - sqrt(5) - sqrt(5) - 5 = -6 - 2sqrt(5). Divided by 4: (-6 - 2sqrt(5))/4 = (-3 - sqrt(5))/2. Then subtract (1 - sqrt(5))/2: (-3 - sqrt(5))/2 - (1 - sqrt(5))/2 = (-3 - sqrt(5) -1 + sqrt(5))/2 = (-4)/2 = -2. So S_5 = -2. Then S_6 = phi*S_5 - S_4 = phi*(-2) - (-1 - sqrt(5))/2. Compute that: -2*phi + (1 + sqrt(5))/2. Since phi = (1 + sqrt(5))/2, so -2*phi = -(1 + sqrt(5)). Therefore, S_6 = -(1 + sqrt(5)) + (1 + sqrt(5))/2 = (-2 - 2sqrt(5) +1 + sqrt(5))/2 = (-1 - sqrt(5))/2. Wait, but earlier we had S_6 = -1. Hmm, this discrepancy suggests a mistake.

Wait, let's check S_6 again. Wait, S_6 was computed as -1 earlier using the trigonometric approach, but using the recurrence, it's giving (-1 - sqrt(5))/2. That's a problem. There's an inconsistency here. Which one is correct?

Given S_0 = 2, S_1 = phi.

Compute S_2: z^2 + 1/z^2. We can compute this as (z + 1/z)^2 - 2 = phi^2 - 2. As we calculated earlier, phi^2 = (3 + sqrt(5))/2, so S_2 = (3 + sqrt(5))/2 - 2 = (3 + sqrt(5) - 4)/2 = (-1 + sqrt(5))/2.

Similarly, S_3 can be computed as (z + 1/z)*(z^2 + 1/z^2) - (z + 1/z). So S_3 = phi*S_2 - S_1. Let's compute that: phi*(-1 + sqrt(5))/2 - phi. Let's factor phi: phi*[ (-1 + sqrt(5))/2 - 1 ] = phi*[ (-1 + sqrt(5) - 2)/2 ] = phi*(sqrt(5) - 3)/2.

But maybe this is getting complicated. Alternatively, using the recurrence S_{n+1} = phi*S_n - S_{n-1}. Let's use that.

Given S_0 = 2, S_1 = phi.

Then S_2 = phi*S_1 - S_0 = phi^2 - 2. Which we already know is (-1 + sqrt(5))/2.

S_3 = phi*S_2 - S_1 = phi*(-1 + sqrt(5))/2 - phi = phi*[ (-1 + sqrt(5))/2 - 1 ] = phi*[ (-1 + sqrt(5) - 2)/2 ] = phi*(sqrt(5) - 3)/2. Let's compute this numerically. sqrt(5) ≈ 2.236, so sqrt(5) - 3 ≈ -0.764. Then multiplied by phi ≈ 1.618 gives ≈ -1.236. Let's check with another method: S_3 = z^3 + 1/z^3. Let's compute z^3 + 1/z^3. Note that z^3 + 1/z^3 = (z + 1/z)^3 - 3*(z + 1/z). So that's phi^3 - 3*phi. Let's compute phi^3.

First, phi^2 = phi + 1, since phi satisfies the equation phi^2 = phi + 1. Wait, let's check that. If phi = (1 + sqrt(5))/2, then phi^2 = [(1 + sqrt(5))/2]^2 = (1 + 2*sqrt(5) + 5)/4 = (6 + 2*sqrt(5))/4 = (3 + sqrt(5))/2. Then phi + 1 = (1 + sqrt(5))/2 + 1 = (1 + sqrt(5) + 2)/2 = (3 + sqrt(5))/2. So yes, phi^2 = phi + 1. Therefore, phi^3 = phi*phi^2 = phi*(phi + 1) = phi^2 + phi = (phi + 1) + phi = 2*phi + 1. Therefore, phi^3 - 3*phi = (2*phi + 1) - 3*phi = -phi + 1. So S_3 = 1 - phi. Since phi ≈ 1.618, S_3 ≈ -0.618. Wait, but earlier calculation gave ≈ -1.236. Wait, that's a discrepancy. What did I do wrong here?

Wait, using the recurrence S_{n+1} = phi*S_n - S_{n-1}. So S_2 = phi*S_1 - S_0. Then S_3 = phi*S_2 - S_1. Let's compute this exactly. S_2 = phi^2 - 2. Then S_3 = phi*(phi^2 - 2) - phi = phi^3 - 2*phi - phi = phi^3 - 3*phi. But we also have that phi^3 = 2*phi + 1, so substituting that in, S_3 = (2*phi + 1) - 3*phi = -phi + 1. Therefore, S_3 = 1 - phi. But when I computed it numerically earlier, I must have made a mistake. Let's recalculate S_3 numerically.

phi ≈ 1.618. Then S_3 = 1 - phi ≈ 1 - 1.618 ≈ -0.618. Let's check with the other method: z^3 + 1/z^3. If z + 1/z = phi, then z^3 + 1/z^3 = (z + 1/z)^3 - 3*(z + 1/z) = phi^3 - 3*phi. As we saw, phi^3 = 2*phi + 1, so substituting, 2*phi + 1 - 3*phi = -phi + 1. So that's correct. So S_3 = 1 - phi ≈ -0.618.

Based on execution_2.2:
Let's check S_6 using the recurrence. Wait, but according to the recurrence, S_6 should be S_5 + S_7? Wait, no, the recurrence is S_{n+1} = phi*S_n - S_{n-1}. So to compute S_6, we need S_5 and S_4.

Wait, S_6 = phi*S_5 - S_4. Given S_5 = -2, S_4 = (-1 - sqrt(5))/2. So S_6 = phi*(-2) - (-1 - sqrt(5))/2. Let's compute this:

First term: -2*phi = -2*(1 + sqrt(5))/2 = -(1 + sqrt(5)).

Second term: -(-1 - sqrt(5))/2 = (1 + sqrt(5))/2.

So S_6 = -(1 + sqrt(5)) + (1 + sqrt(5))/2 = [ -2(1 + sqrt(5)) + (1 + sqrt(5)) ] / 2 = [ -2 - 2sqrt(5) + 1 + sqrt(5) ] / 2 = [ -1 - sqrt(5) ] / 2. Which matches the previous result where S_6 = -1. Wait, no, earlier using the trigonometric approach, we had S_6 = -1. But according to this recurrence, S_6 = (-1 - sqrt(5))/2 ≈ (-1 - 2.236)/2 ≈ -1.618/2 ≈ -0.809, which is different from -1. So there's a contradiction here.

Wait, when we solved the quadratic equation z^2 - phi*z + 1 = 0, the roots are [phi ± sqrt(phi^2 - 4)]/2. We computed phi^2 - 4 as (-5 + sqrt(5))/2. Let me verify that again. phi = (1 + sqrt(5))/2. So phi^2 = (1 + 2*sqrt(5) + 5)/4 = (6 + 2*sqrt(5))/4 = (3 + sqrt(5))/2. Then phi^2 - 4 = (3 + sqrt(5))/2 - 8/2 = (-5 + sqrt(5))/2. That's correct. So sqrt(phi^2 - 4) = sqrt( (-5 + sqrt(5))/2 ). Hmm, but sqrt of a negative number would be imaginary. Wait, (-5 + sqrt(5))/2 is approximately (-5 + 2.236)/2 ≈ (-2.764)/2 ≈ -1.382, which is negative. Therefore, sqrt(phi^2 - 4) is imaginary. Therefore, the roots z are complex numbers with real and imaginary parts. So z = [phi ± i*sqrt(4 - phi^2)]/2. Wait, but since sqrt(phi^2 - 4) is imaginary, we can write it as i*sqrt(4 - phi^2). Therefore, z = [phi ± i*sqrt(4 - phi^2)]/2.

But maybe instead of getting into complex numbers, we can proceed with the recurrence relation. Since we have a quadratic equation, the powers of z can be expressed using the recurrence relation S_{n+1} = phi*S_n - S_{n-1}. Therefore, even if z is complex, the recurrence should hold. Therefore, perhaps my earlier discrepancy was due to a miscalculation.

Wait, let's re-examine S_6. According to the recurrence:

S_0 = 2

S_1 = phi

S_2 = phi*phi - 2 = phi^2 - 2 = (-1 + sqrt(5))/2 ≈ 0.618/2 ≈ 0.309? Wait, sqrt(5) ≈ 2.236, so (-1 + 2.236)/2 ≈ 1.236/2 ≈ 0.618. So S_2 ≈ 0.618.

S_3 = phi*S_2 - S_1 = phi*0.618 - phi ≈ phi*(0.618 - 1) ≈ phi*(-0.382) ≈ 1.618*(-0.382) ≈ -0.618. Which matches the exact value S_3 = 1 - phi ≈ -0.618.

S_4 = phi*S_3 - S_2 = phi*(-0.618) - 0.618 ≈ -0.618*(phi + 1). Since phi + 1 = (1 + sqrt(5))/2 + 1 = (3 + sqrt(5))/2 ≈ (3 + 2.236)/2 ≈ 2.618. So -0.618*2.618 ≈ -1.618. Which is approximately (-1 - sqrt(5))/2 ≈ (-1 - 2.236)/2 ≈ -1.618, so that's correct.

S_5 = phi*S_4 - S_3 ≈ 1.618*(-1.618) - (-0.618) ≈ -2.618 + 0.618 ≈ -2. Which matches S_5 = -2 exactly.

S_6 = phi*S_5 - S_4 ≈ 1.618*(-2) - (-1.618) ≈ -3.236 + 1.618 ≈ -1.618. Which is (-1 - sqrt(5))/2 ≈ (-1 - 2.236)/2 ≈ -1.618. So S_6 ≈ -1.618, not -1. Therefore, my initial assumption that S_6 = -1 was incorrect. So where did the -1 come from? Maybe a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, when I tried to compute S_6 using the trigonometric approach, I assumed that z = e^(i*theta), but if z is not on the unit circle, that approach is invalid. Therefore, that's where the mistake was. So actually, the modulus of z is not 1, so the previous trigonometric approach is incorrect. Therefore, the correct values are those obtained via the recurrence relation.

S_4 ≈ -1.618

S_5 = -2

S_6 ≈ -1.618

S_7 = phi*S_6 - S_5 ≈ 1.618*(-1.618) - (-2) ≈ -2.618 + 2 ≈ -0.618

S_8 = phi*S_7 - S_6 ≈ 1.618*(-0.618) - (-1.618) ≈ -1.618 + 1.618 ≈ 0

S_9 = phi*S_8 - S_7 ≈ 1.618*0 - (-0.618) ≈ 0 + 0.618 ≈ 0.618

S_10 = phi*S_9 - S_8 ≈ 1.618*0.618 - 0 ≈ 1.0

S_11 = phi*S_10 - S_9 ≈ 1.618*1 - 0.618 ≈ 1.618 - 0.618 ≈ 1.0

S_12 = phi*S_11 - S_10 ≈ 1.618*1 - 1 ≈ 0.618

Wait, so from S_10 onwards, we have S_10 = 1, S_11 = 1, S_12 ≈ 0.618, which is the same as S_2.
This suggests that the sequence repeats every 6 terms. Let's check:

Wait, S_10 = 1, S_11 = 1, S_12 ≈ 0.618, which is the same as S_2. So the cycle length is 6? Let's see:

From S_0 to S_5: 2, phi, 0.618, -0.618, -1.618, -2

S_6 to S_11: -1.618, -0.618, 0, 0.618, 1, 1

S_12 to S_17: 0.618, 1, 1.618, 0.618, -0.618, -1.618

Wait, perhaps the period is 6. Let's check:

Looking at S_10 = 1, S_11 = 1, S_12 ≈ 0.618 (which is S_2). Then S_13 would be S_1 + S_11 = phi*1 - 1 ≈ 1.618 - 1 = 0.618. Wait, no, the recurrence is S_{n+1} = phi*S_n - S_{n-1}. So S_12 = phi*S_11 - S_10 = phi*1 - 1 ≈ 1.618 - 1 = 0.618. Then S_13 = phi*S_12 - S_11 ≈ 1.618*0.618 - 1 ≈ 1.0 - 1 = 0. Then S_14 = phi*S_13 - S_12 ≈ 1.618*0 - 0.618 ≈ -0.618. Then S_15 = phi*S_14 - S_13 ≈ 1.618*(-0.618) - 0 ≈ -1.0 - 0 ≈ -1. Then S_16 = phi*S_15 - S_14 ≈ 1.618*(-1) - (-0.618) ≈ -1.618 + 0.618 ≈ -1. Then S_17 = phi*S_16 - S_15 ≈ 1.618*(-1) - (-1) ≈ -1.618 + 1 ≈ -0.618. Then S_18 = phi*S_17 - S_16 ≈ 1.618*(-0.618) - (-1) ≈ -1.0 + 1 ≈ 0. Then S_19 = phi*S_18 - S_17 ≈ 1.618*0 - (-0.618) ≈ 0 + 0.618 ≈ 0.618. Then S_20 = phi*S_19 - S_18 ≈ 1.618*0.618 - 0 ≈ 1.0 - 0 ≈ 1. Then S_21 = phi*S_20 - S_19 ≈ 1.618*1 - 0.618 ≈ 1.618 - 0.618 ≈ 1.0. So indeed, starting from S_10 and S_11 (both 1), the sequence repeats every 6 terms: 1, 1, 0.618, -0.618, -1.618, -2, and then back to 1, 1, etc. Therefore, the periodicity is 6.

Then S_18 = phi*S_17 - S_16 ≈ 1.618*(-0.618) - (-1) ≈ -1.0 + 1 ≈ 0. Then S_19 = phi*S_18 - S_17 ≈ 1.618*0 - (-0.618) ≈ 0 + 0.618 ≈ 0.618. Then S_20 = phi*S_19 - S_18 ≈ 1.618*0.618 - 0 ≈ 1.0 - 0 ≈ 1. Then S_21 = phi*S_20 - S_19 ≈ 1.618*1 - 0.618 ≈ 1.618 - 0.618 ≈ 1.0. So yes, from S_10 onwards, the sequence repeats every 6 terms: 1, 1, 0.618, -0.618, -1.618, -2, then back to 1, 1, etc. Therefore, the period is 6.

Alternatively, since the recurrence relation is linear and homogeneous with constant coefficients, the sequence S_n must be periodic if the roots of the characteristic equation are roots of unity. The characteristic equation for the recurrence S_{n+1} = phi*S_n - S_{n-1} is r^2 - phi*r + 1 = 0. The roots are [phi ± sqrt(phi^2 - 4)]/2. As we saw earlier, sqrt(phi^2 - 4) is imaginary, so the roots are complex conjugates with modulus 1? Let's check the modulus of the roots.

Therefore, the roots lie on the unit circle, which implies that the solutions are periodic. The angle theta can be found by tan(theta) = [sqrt(4 - phi^2)/2] / [phi/2] = sqrt(4 - phi^2)/phi. Let's compute this:

sqrt(4 - phi^2) = sqrt(4 - (3 + sqrt(5))/2) = sqrt( (8 - 3 - sqrt(5))/2 ) = sqrt( (5 - sqrt(5))/2 ). Therefore, tan(theta) = sqrt( (5 - sqrt(5))/2 ) / ( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ) = [2*sqrt( (5 - sqrt(5))/2 )] / (1 + sqrt(5)).

This seems complicated, but perhaps there's a known angle whose cosine is phi/2. Since phi/2 = (1 + sqrt(5))/4 ≈ 0.4045, which is cos(theta) for some theta. Let's compute theta = arccos(phi/2). Let's see, cos(theta) = (1 + sqrt(5))/4 ≈ 0.4045, so theta ≈ 66 degrees (since cos(60°)=0.5, cos(75°)≈0.2588). Let's check cos(66°) ≈ 0.4067, which is close to 0.4045. So theta ≈ 66°, which is approximately 1.15 radians. Then the period would be related to 2π/theta. But since the roots are complex conjugates with angle theta, the sequence S_n would have period 2π/theta. However, since we are dealing with a discrete sequence, the period would be the least integer k such that k*theta ≈ 2π. But given that in our earlier computation, the sequence repeats every 6 terms, which suggests that k=6. Let's check if 6*theta ≈ 2π. If theta ≈ 1.15 radians, then 6*theta ≈ 6.9 radians ≈ 1.1*2π. Not exactly 2π, but perhaps the periodicity is 6 because of the algebraic structure. Alternatively, since the roots are 6th roots of unity multiplied by some factor. But given that the modulus is 1, and the angle theta satisfies 6*theta ≈ 2π, but theta ≈ 1.15, 6*theta≈6.9, which is about 1.1*2π (since 2π≈6.28). So perhaps not exact. However, in our computed terms, the sequence did repeat every 6 terms numerically. Therefore, even though the theoretical period might be different, in practice, due to the specific values, the sequence repeats every 6 terms. Therefore, the period is 6.

Based on execution_7.1:
Therefore, to compute S_85, we can find 85 mod 6. 85 divided by 6 is 14*6=84, remainder 1. Therefore, 85 ≡ 1 mod 6. Therefore, S_85 = S_1 = phi.

But let's confirm this with the earlier terms. Looking back at the list:

12: (-1 + sqrt(5))/2 ≈ 0.618 (S_2)

13: 1 - phi ≈ -0.618 (S_3)

14: (-1 - sqrt(5))/2 ≈ -1.618 (S_4)

16: (-1 - sqrt(5))/2 ≈ -1.618 (S_6)

19: 1 (S_9)

20: 1 (S_10)

21: 0.618 (S_11)

Wait, but according to the earlier list, S_10=1, S_11=1, S_12≈0.618 (which is S_2), S_13≈-0.618 (S_3), S_14≈-1.618 (S_4), S_15=-2 (S_5), S_16≈-1.618 (S_6), S_17≈-0.618 (S_7), S_18=0 (S_8), S_19≈0.618 (S_9), S_20=1 (S_10), S_21=1 (S_11), etc. So the cycle length is 6. Therefore, the sequence repeats every 6 terms starting from n=10. Wait, but S_10 and S_11 are 1,1, which are the same as S_1 and S_2? Wait, S_1=phi, S_2≈0.618, S_3≈-0.618, S_4≈-1.618, S_5=-2, S_6≈-1.618, S_7≈-0.618, S_8=0, S_9≈0.618, S_10=1, S_11=1. So the cycle from S_10 is 1,1,0.618,-0.618,-1.618,-2, then back to 1,1, etc. So the period is 6. Therefore, the sequence S_n has a period of 6 starting from n=1. Wait, but S_1=phi, S_7=phi? Wait, no, S_7≈-0.618, which is not equal to S_1=phi. Therefore, the period isn't 6. Wait, perhaps my earlier assumption is wrong. Let me re-examine the computed terms:

From n=0 to n=21:

0: 2

1: phi

2: (-1 + sqrt(5))/2 ≈ 0.618

3: 1 - phi ≈ -0.618

4: (-1 - sqrt(5))/2 ≈ -1.618

5: -2

6: (-1 - sqrt(5))/2 ≈ -1.618

7: 1 - phi ≈ -0.618

8: 0

9: (-1 + sqrt(5))/2 ≈ 0.618

10: 1

11: 1

12: (-1 + sqrt(5))/2 ≈ 0.618

13: 1 - phi ≈ -0.618

14: (-1 - sqrt(5))/2 ≈ -1.618

15: -2

16: (-1 - sqrt(5))/2 ≈ -1.618

17: 1 - phi ≈ -0.618

18: (-1 + sqrt(5))/2 ≈ 0.618

19: 1

20: 1

21: (-1 + sqrt(5))/2 ≈ 0.618

Wait, so from n=10 onwards, the terms are 1,1,0.618,-0.618,-1.618,-2, and then again 1,1, etc. So the cycle is 6 terms: 1,1,0.618,-0.618,-1.618,-2. Then repeats. Therefore, the period is 6. Therefore, to compute S_85, we can compute 85 mod 6. 85 divided by 6 is 14*6=84, remainder 1. So 85 ≡1 mod6. Therefore, S_85 = S_1 = phi. But wait, looking at the terms, S_1=phi, S_7=phi? No, S_7≈-0.618. Wait, no, perhaps the cycle is not starting at n=1. Wait, perhaps the cycle is of length 6 starting at n=1. Let's check:

S_1=phi, S_7=phi? No, S_7≈-0.618. So that's not. Alternatively, maybe the cycle is longer. Wait, let's list the terms again:

n : S_n

0: 2

1: phi

2: (-1 + sqrt(5))/2 ≈0.618

3:1 - phi≈-0.618

4: (-1 - sqrt(5))/2≈-1.618

5:-2

6: (-1 - sqrt(5))/2≈-1.618

7:1 - phi≈-0.618

8:0

9: (-1 + sqrt(5))/2≈0.618

10:1

11:1

12:≈0.618

13:≈-0.618

14:≈-1.618

15:-2

16:≈-1.618

17:≈-0.618

18:≈0.618

19:1

20:1

21:≈0.618

So from n=10, the terms are 1,1,0.618,-0.618,-1.618,-2, then again 1,1, etc. So the cycle length is 6. Therefore, starting from n=10, every 6 terms, it repeats. Therefore, S_10 corresponds to n=10, which is the first term of the cycle, then n=11 is the second term, etc. Therefore, the cycle is 6 terms: 1,1,0.618,-0.618,-1.618,-2. Then repeats. Therefore, to find S_85, we need to see where 85 falls in the cycle. However, the cycle starts at n=10. Therefore, the terms from n=10 onwards are in the cycle. So n=10: cycle position 0, n=11: position1, ...., n=15: position5, n=16: position0, etc. Therefore, to compute S_85, we need to compute (85 -10) mod6. Because the cycle starts at n=10. So 85 -10 =75. 75 mod6 is 75/6=12*6=72, remainder3. Therefore, 75 mod6=3. Therefore, S_85 corresponds to the 3rd position in the cycle (positions:0:1,1:1,2:0.618,3:-0.618,4:-1.618,5:-2). Therefore, S_85=third term: -0.618, which is 1 - phi. But wait, 1 - phi is exactly -0.618. So S_85=1 - phi. But according to the earlier assumption, the cycle is 6 terms starting at n=10. Therefore, the answer would be 1 - phi.

n: 10:1, 11:1, 12:0.618, 13:-0.618, 14:-1.618, 15:-2, 16:1,1, etc. So the cycle is 6 terms. Therefore, for n >=10, S_n corresponds to the cycle. Therefore, 85-10=75. 75 divided by6 is12*6=72, remainder3. Therefore, the 3rd term in the cycle (0:1,1:1,2:0.618,3:-0.618,4:-1.618,5:-2). So remainder3 corresponds to -0.618, which is1 - phi. Therefore, S_85=1 - phi. But according to the problem statement, the answer is expected in boxed notation. However, the question is to find S_85 + S_{85}. Since S_85=1 - phi, and S_{85}= same, so the sum is 2*(1 - phi). But 1 - phi is -1/\phi. Therefore, 2*( -1/\phi )= -2/\phi. But since phi= (1 + sqrt(5))/2, 1/phi= (sqrt(5)-1)/2. Therefore, -2/\phi= -2*(sqrt(5)-1)/2= -(sqrt(5)-1)=1 - sqrt(5). Therefore, the answer is 1 - sqrt(5). However, according to the earlier computation via recurrence, S_85=1 - phi, so adding them gives 2*(1 - phi)=2 - 2phi. But 2 - 2phi=2 -2*( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 )=2 - (1 + sqrt(5))=1 - sqrt(5). Therefore, the final answer is 1 - sqrt(5). However, according to the problem statement, the answer is to be in boxed notation. Therefore, the final answer is \boxed{1 - \sqrt{5}}.
