Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question says that if \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to find the remainder when \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) is divided by 7. Hmm, modular arithmetic, right? Let me think about how to approach this.

First, since \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), that means when n is divided by 7, the remainder is 2.
So, we can express n as \( n = 7k + 2 \) for some integer k. But maybe instead of substituting like that, I can work directly with the congruence. Let me see.

The expression we need is \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \). Let's compute each term modulo 7.

<prompt_1.1> Compute each term in the expression \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) modulo 7, given \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \). </prompt_1.1>

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this problem. Let me think. Sometimes, in modular arithmetic, especially with products, we can look for patterns or use properties like distributive law. Let's see.

Alternatively, since we know n ≡ 2 mod7, we can let n = 2 + 7m for some integer m. Then substitute into the expression:

<prompt_1.2> Use the alternative method by substituting \( n = 2 + 7m \) into the expression \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) and simplify. </prompt_1.2>

Another angle: Maybe factor the expression somehow. Let's see.

<prompt_1.3> Explore the possibility of factoring the expression \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) and simplifying it. </prompt_1.3>

Alternatively, notice that the terms n+2, n+4, n+6 are three consecutive even numbers if n is even.
But since we are modulo 7, not sure if that helps. Wait, n ≡2 mod7, so n is 2 more than a multiple of7. So n is 2,9,16, etc.

<prompt_1.4> Test specific values of \( n \) congruent to 2 modulo 7 to verify the result and check for patterns. </prompt_1.4>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
Let's start with each factor:

1. \( n + 2 \): Since \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), adding 2 to both sides gives \( n + 2 \equiv 2 + 2 \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \).

2. \( n + 4 \): Similarly, \( n + 4 \equiv 2 + 4 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \).

3. \( n + 6 \): Here, \( n + 6 \equiv 2 + 6 \equiv 8 \pmod{7} \). But 8 divided by 7 is 1 with a remainder of 1, so this simplifies to 1 modulo 7.
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
\( (n + 2) = (2 + 7m + 2) = 4 + 7m \)
Similarly, \( (n + 4) = 6 + 7m \)
\( (n + 6) = 8 + 7m = 1 + 7m \) (since 8 divided by 7 is 1 with remainder 1)

So each term is 4, 6, 1 modulo 7 plus multiples of 7. When we multiply them:

\( (4 + 7m)(6 + 7m)(1 + 7m) \)

But since we are mod 7, the 7m terms will vanish. So multiplying 4*6*1 = 24, which is 3 mod7. So same result.
</execution_1.2>

<execution_1.3>
\( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \)

Let me expand two terms first and then multiply. Let's take (n + 2)(n + 4):

\( (n + 2)(n + 4) = n^2 + 6n + 8 \)

Now multiply this by (n + 6):

\( (n^2 + 6n + 8)(n + 6) = n^3 + 6n^2 + 6n^2 + 36n + 8n + 48 \)
Combine like terms:

\( n^3 + 12n^2 + 44n + 48 \)

Now, we need to compute this modulo 7. Let's reduce each coefficient modulo 7:

12 mod 7 is 5 (since 7*1=7, 12-7=5)

44 mod 7: 7*6=42, 44-42=2

48 mod 7: 7*6=42, 48-42=6

So the expression modulo 7 becomes:

\( n^3 + 5n^2 + 2n + 6 \)
</execution_1.3>

<execution_1.4>
So when you add 2,4,6, those numbers might have specific residues. Let's take n=2: (2+2)(2+4)(2+6)=4*6*8=4*6*1 (since 8≡1 mod7). 4*6=24≡3 mod7, 3*1=3. So 3. Similarly, take n=9: (9+2)=11, (9+4)=13, (9+6)=15. Then 11*13*15. But modulo7: 11≡4,13≡6,15≡1. So again 4*6*1=24≡3. So seems consistent.

Based on execution_1.1:
So now, we need to multiply these three results together modulo 7:
\( 4 \times 6 \times 1 \).

<prompt_2.1> Multiply the results \( 4 \), \( 6 \), and \( 1 \) together and find the product modulo 7. </prompt_2.1>

Based on execution_1.2:
So same answer.

Based on execution_1.4:
Another check: n=16: (16+2)=18, (16+4)=20, (16+6)=22. 18*20*22. Modulo7:

<prompt_2.2> Perform a final check with \( n = 23 \) to ensure consistency and conclude the solution. </prompt_2.2>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Let's compute that step by step:

First, multiply 4 and 6: \( 4 \times 6 = 24 \). Then, 24 modulo 7. Since 7*3=21, 24 - 21 = 3. So 24 ≡ 3 mod 7.

Then multiply this result by 1: 3 * 1 = 3. So the product is 3 modulo 7.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
18 mod7=4, 20 mod7=6, 22 mod7=1. So again 4*6*1=24≡3. Yep.

Therefore, regardless of the value of n ≡2 mod7, the product will always be 3 mod7. So the remainder is 3 when divided by7.
</execution_2.2>
</Execution_2>

<Final_answer>
Therefore, the remainder when $(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)$ is divided by 7 is $\boxed{3}$.
