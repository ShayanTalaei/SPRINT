Okay, so I need to subtract two numbers in base 9: 58_9 minus 18_9. Hmm, base 9, right? Let me remember how subtraction works in different bases. I think it's similar to base 10, but when borrowing, you borrow a group of 9 instead of 10. Let me take it step by step.

First, let me write down the numbers vertically to align them by place value, just like in base 10 subtraction.

<prompt_1.1> Align the numbers 58_9 and 18_9 vertically for subtraction. </prompt_1.1>

So, in base 9, the rightmost digit is the ones place (9^0), and the next one is the nines place (9^1). Let's see:

```
  5  8
- 1  8
--------
```
</execution_1.1>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Starting with the rightmost digits: 8 - 8. That's straightforward, right?
In base 9, 8 minus 8 is 0. So the first digit (rightmost) of the answer is 0.

Now, moving to the next digit (the nines place). Here, we have 5 - 1. That's 4, right?
Because 5 minus 1 is 4. So in base 9, that would still be 4. So putting that together, the answer would be 40_9.

Wait, that seems too easy. Let me check if I did that correctly.

But hold on, maybe I need to verify by converting both numbers to base 10, subtracting, and then converting back to base 9. Let me try that to confirm.

<prompt_2.1> Verify the subtraction result by converting both numbers to base 10, subtracting, and converting back to base 9. </prompt_2.1>

But wait, let me try another example to make sure I understand the borrowing process. Suppose the subtraction was something like 32_9 - 45_9. Then we would need to borrow, right?

But in this case, 58_9 - 18_9, we didn't have to borrow. So maybe the answer is indeed 40_9.

Let me confirm once more by another method. Let's expand the numbers in base 9.

<prompt_2.2> Confirm the subtraction result by expanding the numbers 58_9 and 18_9 in base 9 and subtracting. </prompt_2.2>

Alternatively, if we were to subtract digit by digit with borrowing, even though it's not necessary here. Let's imagine the top digit is smaller.

<prompt_2.3> Consider the subtraction process with borrowing in the context of 58_9 - 18_9 and confirm the result. </prompt_2.3>

Another way to check is to add 18_9 to 40_9 and see if we get 58_9.

<prompt_2.4> Add 18_9 and 40_9 to verify if the result is 58_9. </prompt_2.4>

First, converting 58_9 to base 10. The rightmost digit is 8 * 9^0 = 8 * 1 = 8. The next digit is 5 * 9^1 = 5 * 9 = 45. So total is 45 + 8 = 53 in base 10.

Then, converting 18_9 to base 10. Rightmost digit is 8 * 1 = 8. Next digit is 1 * 9 = 9. So total is 9 + 8 = 17 in base 10.

Subtracting in base 10: 53 - 17 = 36. Now, converting 36 back to base 9.

To convert 36 to base 9: Divide by 9. 36 รท 9 = 4 with a remainder of 0. So that's 4 * 9^1 + 0 * 9^0, which is 40_9.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
58_9 is 5*9 + 8 = 45 + 8 = 53 in base 10.

18_9 is 1*9 + 8 = 9 + 8 = 17 in base 10.

Subtracting in base 10: 53 - 17 = 36.

Now, convert 36 back to base 9. To do that, divide 36 by 9. 9*4=36, so that's 4*9 + 0, so 40_9.

<execution_2.3>
For example, if it was 43_9 - 18_9. Let's see: 3 - 8 can't do, borrow 1 from the 4, making it 3, and the 3 becomes 3 + 9 = 12 (in base 10). Then 12 - 8 = 4, and 3 - 1 = 2. So 24_9. But in our original problem, no borrowing is needed.
</execution_2.3>

<execution_2.4>
Let me do that addition in base 9. 

Adding the rightmost digits: 8 + 0 = 8. 

Then, the next digits: 4 + 1 = 5. So 5 8, which is 58_9. That matches the original top number. So that works. 

Therefore, 58_9 - 18_9 = 40_9.

</Execution_2>

<Final_answer>
Therefore, the result of the subtraction $58_9 - 18_9$ in base $9$ is $\boxed{40_9}$.
