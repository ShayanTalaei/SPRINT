Okay, so I need to find the value of N such that the sum of the first N positive odd numbers is 121. Hmm, let me start by recalling what the sum of odd numbers is. I remember that there's a formula for the sum of the first N odd numbers. Wait, is it N squared? Let me check that.

<prompt_1.1> Verify if the sum of the first N odd numbers is indeed N squared by calculating the sum for the first few values of N. </prompt_1.1>

For example, the sum of the first 1 odd number is 1, which is 1². The sum of the first 2 is 1 + 3 = 4, which is 2². First 3: 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 = 3². Yeah, that seems to hold. So the formula is Sum = N².

Based on execution_1.1:
So if the sum is 121, then N² = 121. Therefore, N would be the square root of 121.
The square root of 121 is 11, because 11*11 is 121. So N should be 11.

Wait, that seems straightforward. But let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. Let me verify with a few more examples.

<prompt_2.1> Verify the formula by calculating the sum of odd numbers up to 11 using both the formula and direct addition. </prompt_2.1>

But maybe I should also consider why the formula works. Let me think about that.

<prompt_2.2> Explain why the formula for the sum of the first N odd numbers, N², is correct. </prompt_2.2>

Alternatively, if I didn't remember the formula, I could approach it step by step. Let's say I list out the odd numbers and add them up until I reach 121. Let's try that.

<prompt_2.3> List out odd numbers and add them step by step until reaching the sum of 121 to verify the value of N. </prompt_2.3>

Another way to think about it: each odd number can be represented as 2k-1 where k is from 1 to N. So the sum is the sum from k=1 to N of (2k - 1).
Breaking that down, it's 2*sum(k from 1 to N) - sum(1 from 1 to N). Which is 2*(N(N+1)/2) - N = N(N+1) - N = N² + N - N = N².

For instance, if N=5, the sum should be 25. Let's add them: 1+3=4, +5=9, +7=16, +9=25. Yep, that works. So applying the same logic, if the sum is 121, N is 11.

<execution_2.2>
The nth odd number is 2n - 1. So if we sum them from n=1 to N, it's the sum of (2n - 1). Let's compute that sum. Expanding it, it's 2*sum(n) - sum(1). The sum of n from 1 to N is N(N+1)/2, so 2*(N(N+1)/2) is N(N+1). Then subtracting sum(1) which is N, so N(N+1) - N = N² + N - N = N². Yep, that checks out. So the formula is definitely Sum = N².

First odd number: 1. Sum = 1. That's N=1.

Second odd number: 3. Sum = 1 + 3 = 4. N=2.

Third: 5. Sum = 4 + 5 = 9. N=3.

Fourth: 7. Sum = 9 + 7 = 16. N=4.

Fifth: 9. Sum = 16 + 9 = 25. N=5.

Sixth: 11. Sum = 25 + 11 = 36. N=6.

Seventh: 13. Sum = 36 + 13 = 49. N=7.

Eighth: 15. Sum = 49 + 15 = 64. N=8.

Ninth: 17. Sum = 64 + 17 = 81. N=9.

Tenth: 19. Sum = 81 + 19 = 100. N=10.

Eleventh: 21. Sum = 100 + 21 = 121. N=11.

<Final_answer>
Therefore, the value of $N$ for which the sum of the first $N$ positive odd numbers is 121 is $\boxed{11}$.
