Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, we have two runners, A and B, starting at point O on a linear track and running in the same direction. Runner B is three times as fast as runner A. There's an observer at point P, which is perpendicular to the track from O. We need to find the maximum angle APB in degrees.

Hmm, first, let me visualize the setup. The track is a straight line, with O as the starting point.
Runners A and B are moving along this track. The observer is at point P, which is directly perpendicular to the track at O. So, if I imagine the track as the x-axis, then O is at (0,0), and P is at (0, p) for some p. The Asymptote code shows P at (0,1), but maybe the actual position isn't important as long as OP is perpendicular.

Runners A and B start at O and run to the right (assuming the track is horizontal). Runner B is three times as fast as A. So if A's speed is v, B's speed is 3v. After time t, A would be at position (vt, 0) and B at (3vt, 0).

The observer at P is watching the angle between the lines PA and PB. We need to find the maximum value of this angle as the runners move along the track. So angle APB is the angle at point P between points A and B.

Wait, actually, angle APB is the angle at P between the lines of sight to A and B. So, in terms of coordinates, if P is at (0, p), A is at (vt, 0), and B is at (3vt, 0). Then, angle APB is the angle between vectors PA and PB.

To find the maximum of this angle, maybe we can use some trigonometry or calculus. Let me think.

First, let's set up a coordinate system. Let me place point O at the origin (0,0).
Then, the track is along the x-axis. Point P is at (0, h), where h is the height perpendicular to the track. The Asymptote code uses h=1, but since the problem doesn't specify distances, maybe the actual value of h won't matter, or perhaps we can set h=1 for simplicity.

Let's assume h=1 for simplicity. So P is at (0,1).

Runners A and B start at O (0,0) and run along the x-axis. Let's denote the speed of A as v, so the speed of B is 3v. After time t, A is at (vt, 0) and B is at (3vt, 0).

We need to find the angle APB as a function of time t, and then find its maximum value.

<prompt_1.1> Set up a coordinate system and define the positions of runners A and B as functions of time. </prompt_1.1>

But wait, maybe there's another way to approach this problem without parametrizing time.

<prompt_1.2> Consider alternative approaches to the problem and discuss their complexity. </prompt_1.2>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
So, points:

- P: (0, 1)

- A: (vt, 0)

- B: (3vt, 0)

We can model this as a triangle APB, with P at (0,1), A moving along the x-axis, and B moving three times faster. The angle at P is angle APB, which we need to maximize.

To find angle APB, we can use the coordinates to compute the angle between the lines PA and PB.

First, let's find the vectors PA and PB.

Vector PA goes from P to A: (vt - 0, 0 - 1) = (vt, -1)

Vector PB goes from P to B: (3vt - 0, 0 - 1) = (3vt, -1)

The angle between two vectors can be found using the dot product formula:

cos(theta) = (PA · PB) / (|PA| |PB|)

Compute the dot product PA · PB:

= (vt)(3vt) + (-1)(-1)

= 3v²t² + 1

Compute |PA|:

= sqrt( (vt)^2 + (-1)^2 ) = sqrt(v²t² + 1)

Similarly, |PB|:

= sqrt( (3vt)^2 + (-1)^2 ) = sqrt(9v²t² + 1)

Therefore,

cos(theta) = (3v²t² + 1) / [ sqrt(v²t² + 1) * sqrt(9v²t² + 1) ]

Our goal is to maximize theta, which is equivalent to minimizing cos(theta), since cosine is a decreasing function in [0, π].
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
Let me see.

Alternatively, since the runners are moving at constant speeds, their positions are linear functions of time. The angle APB is a function of their positions. Maybe we can relate the angle to the positions and use calculus or trigonometric identities to find its maximum.

But perhaps another approach is to consider the locus of points P such that angle APB is constant. That's a circle passing through A and B. The maximum angle occurs when the circle is tangent to the path of P. Wait, but in this case, P is fixed. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, think of the angle APB as the angle between the lines PA and PB. To maximize this angle, we need to find the positions of A and B such that the triangle APB has the maximum possible angle at P.

Let me set x = v²t² for simplicity.

Based on execution_1.2:
But since A and B are moving, it's a bit dynamic.

Wait, but since B is always three times as far from O as A is.

<prompt_2.2> Analyze the dynamic relationship between A and B and its effect on the angle. </prompt_2.2>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Then, since vt is the x-coordinate of A, which is moving away from O. Since both runners start at O and move away, vt increases with t. So x ranges from 0 to infinity.

Then, |PA| = sqrt(x + 1)

|PB| = sqrt(9x + 1)

So, cos(theta) becomes:

(3x + 1) / [ sqrt(x + 1) * sqrt(9x + 1) ]

Let me denote f(x) = (3x + 1) / [ sqrt(x + 1) * sqrt(9x + 1) ]

We need to find the value of x that minimizes f(x), which in turn maximizes theta.

So, to find the minimum of f(x), we can take the derivative f'(x), set it to zero, and solve for x. Let's compute f'(x).

First, let's write f(x) as:

f(x) = (3x + 1) / [ (x + 1)(9x + 1) ]^{1/2}

Let me denote the denominator as D = [(x + 1)(9x + 1)]^{1/2}

So f(x) = (3x + 1) / D

To find f'(x), use the quotient rule:

f'(x) = [3 * D - (3x + 1) * (1/2) * D' / D ] / D^2

Wait, maybe better to write f(x) as (3x +1) * [ (x +1)(9x +1) ]^{-1/2}

Then, f'(x) = 3 * [ (x +1)(9x +1) ]^{-1/2} + (3x +1) * (-1/2) * [ (9x +1) + (x +1)*9 ] * [ (x +1)(9x +1) ]^{-3/2}

That's a bit messy, but let's proceed step by step.

Let me denote:

Let’s let’s denote:

Let’s compute f'(x):

f(x) = (3x + 1) * [ (x +1)(9x +1) ]^{-1/2}

Let’s let’s set g(x) = 3x +1 and h(x) = [ (x +1)(9x +1) ]^{1/2}

Then f(x) = g(x) / h(x), so f'(x) = (g’(x) h(x) - g(x) h’(x)) / [h(x)]^2

Compute g’(x) = 3

Compute h(x) = sqrt( (x +1)(9x +1) )

Compute h’(x):

Let’s write h(x) = [ (x +1)(9x +1) ]^{1/2}

Let’s denote u(x) = (x +1)(9x +1) = 9x² +10x +1

Then h(x) = u(x)^{1/2}, so h’(x) = (1/2) u(x)^{-1/2} * u’(x)

Compute u’(x) = 18x +10

Therefore, h’(x) = (1/2)(18x +10) / sqrt(9x² +10x +1)

Therefore, putting back into f’(x):

f’(x) = [3 * sqrt(9x² +10x +1) - (3x +1)*(1/2)(18x +10)/sqrt(9x² +10x +1) ] / (9x² +10x +1)

To combine the terms in the numerator, multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(9x² +10x +1):

= [3(9x² +10x +1) - (3x +1)(9x +5)] / (9x² +10x +1)^{3/2}

Let me compute the numerator:

First term: 3(9x² +10x +1) = 27x² +30x +3

Second term: (3x +1)(9x +5) = 27x² +15x +9x +5 = 27x² +24x +5

Therefore, the numerator is:

27x² +30x +3 - (27x² +24x +5) = (27x² -27x²) + (30x -24x) + (3 -5) = 6x -2

Therefore, f’(x) = (6x -2) / (9x² +10x +1)^{3/2}

Set f’(x) = 0:

6x -2 = 0 => x = 2/6 = 1/3

So critical point at x = 1/3. Since x = v²t², this corresponds to time t = sqrt(x)/v = sqrt(1/3)/v = 1/(v*sqrt(3)). But we might not need the exact time.

Now, check if this is a minimum. Since f’(x) changes from negative to positive around x =1/3?

Let’s test x <1/3, say x=0:

f’(0) = (0 -2)/denominator = negative

For x >1/3, say x=1:

f’(1) = (6*1 -2)/denominator = 4/positive = positive

Therefore, f(x) has a minimum at x=1/3. Therefore, the minimal value of cos(theta) is f(1/3).
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Because if A is at position x at time t, then B is at 3x. So their separation is 2x.

Therefore, maybe we can parametrize the problem in terms of x, the distance of A from O, so that B is at 3x. Then, x = vt, so t = x/v. Then, the separation between A and B is 3x - x = 2x.

But how does this help? Let's see.

So, the coordinates become:

- P: (0,1)

- A: (x, 0)

- B: (3x, 0)

So, angle APB is the angle at P between points A and B. So, with P fixed, as x increases, points A and B move to the right. The angle APB will depend on the positions of A and B relative to P.

So, maybe we can write the angle APB in terms of x and then find its maximum.

Alternatively, since the angle is determined by the positions of A and B, which are moving with B always three times as far as A.

Compute f(1/3):

First, x =1/3.

Compute numerator: 3x +1 = 3*(1/3) +1 =1 +1=2

Compute denominator: sqrt(x +1)*sqrt(9x +1) = sqrt(1/3 +1)*sqrt(3 +1) = sqrt(4/3)*sqrt(4) = (2/sqrt(3))*2 = 4/sqrt(3)

Therefore, f(1/3) = 2 / (4/sqrt(3)) = 2 * sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866

So cos(theta) = sqrt(3)/2, which corresponds to theta = 30 degrees.

But is this the minimal value of cos(theta)? Since we found a critical point here, and since as x approaches 0 and infinity, let's check the behavior of f(x).

As x approaches 0:

f(x) = (3x +1)/[sqrt(x +1)*sqrt(9x +1)] ≈ (0 +1)/[sqrt(1)*sqrt(0 +1)] =1/1=1

So cos(theta) approaches 1, which is theta approaching 0 degrees.

As x approaches infinity:

f(x) = (3x +1)/[sqrt(x +1)*sqrt(9x +1)] ≈ (3x)/[sqrt(x)*sqrt(9x)] = 3x / [sqrt(x)*3sqrt(x)] = 3x / [3x] =1

So cos(theta) approaches 1 again. Therefore, the function f(x) has a minimum at x=1/3 with cos(theta)=sqrt(3)/2, which corresponds to theta=30 degrees. Therefore, the maximum angle APB is 30 degrees.

But wait, the problem says "Find the maximum of angle APB, in degrees". So the answer is 30 degrees.

So, with P at (0,1), A at (x,0), B at (3x,0). Then, angle APB is the angle between vectors PA and PB.

Vectors:

PA = A - P = (x, -1)

PB = B - P = (3x, -1)

Then, the angle theta between PA and PB is given by:

cos(theta) = (PA · PB) / (|PA| |PB|)

Compute PA · PB = (x)(3x) + (-1)(-1) = 3x² +1

|PA| = sqrt(x² +1)

|PB| = sqrt((3x)^2 +1) = sqrt(9x² +1)

Therefore, cos(theta) = (3x² +1)/(sqrt(x² +1) sqrt(9x² +1))

Same expression as before. So, theta is maximized when cos(theta) is minimized. So, we need to minimize f(x) = (3x² +1)/(sqrt(x² +1) sqrt(9x² +1))

Let me set y = x², then y >=0.

Then, f(y) = (3y +1)/[sqrt(y +1) sqrt(9y +1)]

We need to find the minimum of f(y) for y >=0.

Take derivative of f(y) with respect to y:

f'(y) = [3*sqrt((y +1)(9y +1)) - (3y +1)* ( (1/(2sqrt(y +1)))(9y +1) + (1/(2sqrt(9y +1)))(9) ) ] / ( (y +1)(9y +1) )

Wait, this seems complicated. Maybe better to use logarithmic differentiation.

Let’s take ln(f(y)) = ln(3y +1) - (1/2)ln(y +1) - (1/2)ln(9y +1)

Then, derivative is:

f’(y)/f(y) = 3/(3y +1) - (1/(2(y +1))) - (9/(2(9y +1)))

Set derivative to zero:

3/(3y +1) - 1/(2(y +1)) - 9/(2(9y +1)) =0

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate denominators:

6/(3y +1) -1/(y +1) -9/(9y +1) =0

Let me write this as:

6/(3y +1) = 1/(y +1) +9/(9y +1)

Let’s compute the right-hand side:

Find a common denominator for the two fractions: (y +1)(9y +1)

So:

[ (9y +1) +9(y +1) ] / [ (y +1)(9y +1) ] = [9y +1 +9y +9]/[ (y +1)(9y +1) ] = [18y +10]/[ (y +1)(9y +1) ]

Therefore, equation becomes:

6/(3y +1) = (18y +10)/[ (y +1)(9y +1) ]

Cross-multiplying:

6*(y +1)(9y +1) = (18y +10)(3y +1)

Let me expand both sides:

Left side:

6*(y +1)(9y +1) =6*[9y² + y +9y +1] =6*[9y² +10y +1] =54y² +60y +6

Right side:

(18y +10)(3y +1) =18y*3y +18y*1 +10*3y +10*1 =54y² +18y +30y +10 =54y² +48y +10

Set left side equal to right side:

54y² +60y +6 =54y² +48y +10

Subtract right side from left side:

(54y² -54y²) + (60y -48y) + (6 -10) =12y -4 =0

Thus, 12y -4=0 => y=4/12=1/3

So y=1/3 is the critical point. Since y =x², x= sqrt(1/3). Since x is a distance, we take the positive root. So x=1/sqrt(3).

Therefore, the minimum of f(y) occurs at y=1/3, so x=1/sqrt(3). Then, the minimal cos(theta) is f(1/3).

Compute f(1/3):

x=1/sqrt(3), so x²=1/3

Compute numerator:3*(1/3) +1=1 +1=2

Denominator:sqrt(1/3 +1)*sqrt(9*(1/3)+1)=sqrt(4/3)*sqrt(4)= (2/sqrt(3))*2=4/sqrt(3)

Therefore, cos(theta)=2/(4/sqrt(3))= (2*sqrt(3))/4= sqrt(3)/2

Therefore, cos(theta)=sqrt(3)/2, so theta=30 degrees.

Wait, cos(theta)=sqrt(3)/2 implies theta=30°, since cos(30°)=sqrt(3)/2.

But wait, angle APB is 30 degrees? But we were supposed to find the maximum angle. However, since we found the minimal value of cos(theta), which corresponds to the maximum angle. So the maximum angle is 30 degrees.

But let me verify this result.

Let me check with another approach. Let's consider the positions:

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
When x=1/sqrt(3), then A is at (1/sqrt(3),0) and B is at (3/sqrt(3),0) = (sqrt(3),0). So, from point P(0,1), the lines PA and PB form a triangle with PA going to (1/sqrt(3),0) and PB to (sqrt(3),0). The angle at P between these two points.

Alternatively, maybe we can use geometry to see that this is the case. For example, when the angle is maximized, the point P is such that the circle through A and B is tangent to the line OP. Wait, but in this case, P is fixed. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, think of the angle APB as the angle subtended by AB at point P. To maximize this angle, we need to find the point P such that the circle through A and B with center such that the tangents from P touch the circle. But in this case, P is fixed. Wait, perhaps not.

Alternatively, consider that for a fixed segment AB, the angle APB is maximized when P is such that the circle through A and B with the largest possible angle at P. But in this case, P is fixed, so maybe the maximum occurs when AB is positioned such that the angle is maximized.

</Execution_4>

<Plan_5>
Based on execution_4.1:
Alternatively, consider that as A and B move away from O, the angle APB first increases and then decreases. There must be a maximum point. Our calculation shows that this occurs when x=1/sqrt(3), leading to angle 30 degrees.

But let me check with some sample values.

For example, take x=1:

<prompt_5.1> Verify the result by checking sample values and confirm the maximum angle. </prompt_5.1>

Another check: when x approaches 0, angle APB approaches 0, as both A and B are near O, so lines PA and PB are almost vertical, making a very small angle.

When x is very large, A and B are far away, but B is three times farther. The angle APB would also approach 0, as the points are colinear from P's perspective.

Therefore, the maximum angle occurs somewhere in between, which according to our calculation is at x=1/sqrt(3), giving 30 degrees.

But let me check if there's a possibility that the angle could be larger.

Suppose we take x= sqrt(3)/3 ≈0.577.

<prompt_5.2> Re-evaluate the result for x = sqrt(3)/3 and confirm the maximum angle. </prompt_5.2>

Alternatively, think of the problem in terms of the Law of Sines.

In triangle APB, let's denote angle at P as theta.

x=1, so A is at (1,0), B at (3,0). Compute angle APB.

Compute vectors PA=(1, -1), PB=(3, -1)

Dot product: 1*3 + (-1)*(-1)=3 +1=4

|PA|=sqrt(1+1)=sqrt(2), |PB|=sqrt(9+1)=sqrt(10)

cos(theta)=4/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(10))=4/sqrt(20)=4/(2*sqrt(5))=2/sqrt(5)≈0.894, so theta≈26.565 degrees.

Which is less than 30 degrees. So 30 degrees is indeed larger.
</execution_5.1>

<execution_5.2>
Then, x=1/sqrt(3), so x²=1/3. Then, cos(theta)=sqrt(3)/2, so theta=30 degrees. Let's compute the angle.

Alternatively, compute the slopes of PA and PB.

For x=1/sqrt(3):

PA is from (0,1) to (1/sqrt(3),0). The slope is (0 -1)/(1/sqrt(3) -0) = -sqrt(3)

Similarly, PB is from (0,1) to (sqrt(3),0). The slope is (0 -1)/(sqrt(3)-0) = -1/sqrt(3)

The angle between two lines with slopes m1 and m2 is given by:

tan(theta) = |(m2 - m1)/(1 + m1m2)|

So here, m1 = -sqrt(3), m2 = -1/sqrt(3)

tan(theta) = |( (-1/sqrt(3)) - (-sqrt(3)) ) / (1 + (-sqrt(3))*(-1/sqrt(3)) )|

Simplify numerator:

(-1/sqrt(3) + sqrt(3)) = (-1/sqrt(3) + 3/sqrt(3)) = (2/sqrt(3))

Denominator:

1 + (sqrt(3)/sqrt(3)) =1 +1=2

Therefore, tan(theta)= (2/sqrt(3))/2 =1/sqrt(3)

Therefore, theta= arctan(1/sqrt(3))=30 degrees. So that checks out. Therefore, the angle is indeed 30 degrees.
</execution_5.2>

<execution_5.3>
Then, by the Law of Sines:

AB / sin(theta) = PA / sin(angle at B) = PB / sin(angle at A)

But this might complicate things. Alternatively, use coordinates.

Alternatively, use calculus of variations, but that's more advanced.

Alternatively, use geometry: the angle APB is maximized when the circle through A and B with the smallest possible radius. The radius is inversely related to the angle. So, the smaller the radius, the larger the angle.

But since P is fixed, perhaps the maximum angle occurs when the circle passing through A and B is tangent to some constraint. But since A and B are moving along the x-axis, maybe the maximum angle occurs when the circle through A and B is tangent to the line through P. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, think of the angle APB as the angle between the two lines PA and PB. The tangent of the angle is |PA x PB| / (PA · PB). But maximizing the angle would correspond to maximizing tan(theta), but since theta is acute, maximizing tan(theta) is equivalent to maximizing theta.

But perhaps this approach is more complicated.

Alternatively, use geometry software to plot the angle as a function of x and see if the maximum is indeed 30 degrees. But since I can't do that here, I have to rely on calculus.

Given that the derivative leads us to x=1/sqrt(3) and the second derivative test (if done) would confirm a minimum in cos(theta), hence a maximum in theta, I think the answer is 30 degrees.

Therefore, the maximum of angle APB is 30 degrees.
