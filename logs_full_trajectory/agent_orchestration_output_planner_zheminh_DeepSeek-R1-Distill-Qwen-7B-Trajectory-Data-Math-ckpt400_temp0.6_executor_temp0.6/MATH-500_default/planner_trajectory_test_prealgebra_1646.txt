<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to find the measure of angle AFD in this quadrilateral ABCD where angles BAD and CDA are trisected. Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem step by step.

First, let me recall what trisected means.
If angles BAD and CDA are trisected, that means each of those angles is divided into three equal parts. So, angle BAD is split into three angles of equal measure, and angle CDA is also split into three equal angles.

Looking at the Asymptote code, they've labeled some angles as x and y, and there are specific angle measures given: 110 degrees at (2.5, 3.5) and 100 degrees at (6.5-.2, 3.5). Also, there are trisectors: lines AE and AF are drawn from point A, and lines EF and FD are drawn from point E and F respectively. Points E and F are labeled, and there's an angle labeled x near the middle.

Let me try to visualize the figure based on the Asymptote code. Points are plotted as A(0,0), B(2,4), C(7,4), D(7,-2). So, ABCD is a quadrilateral with coordinates given. Then E is at (4.5 - 0.2, 1 - 0.2) which is approximately (4.3, 0.8), and F is at (5,3). So, lines are drawn from A to E to D, and from A to F to D. So, AE and AF are trisectors of angle BAD, and EF and FD are trisectors of angle CDA? Wait, maybe not. Let me parse the Asymptote code again.

Wait, the Asymptote code draws A connected to E connected to D, and A connected to F connected to D. So, AE and ED form two lines from A to D via E, and AF and FD form another set. But the labels for x are near (1,1.5), (2,1), (2,-1), which are probably the trisection marks. Similarly, y labels are near (5.5, 0.5), (6.5,0), (5, -1.5). So, angle BAD is trisected into three angles each of measure x, and angle ADC is trisected into three angles each of measure y. Then, there are given angles at (2.5,3.5) which is 110 degrees and at (6.5,3.5) which is 100 degrees.

Wait, maybe the angles at point F are given? Let me check the Asymptote code labels.

<prompt_1.1> Analyze the given angle measures and their positions in the diagram. </prompt_1.1>

But let me confirm this using another method.

Alternatively, maybe using the concept of triangle angle sums. Let's consider triangle AFD. If we can find two of its angles, then we can find the third one, which is angle AFD.

<prompt_1.2> Consider using triangle angle sums to find angle AFD. </prompt_1.2>
-----

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let's consider the entire quadrilateral. The sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is 360 degrees. So, angles at A, B, C, D add up to 360. If angles at A and D are each trisected into three equal parts, then angle BAD is trisected into three angles of x each, so angle BAD = 3x. Similarly, angle ADC is trisected into three angles of y each, so angle ADC = 3y. Then angles at B and C would be the remaining angles.

<prompt_1.3> Explore the quadrilateral angle sum approach to find angle AFD. </prompt_1.3>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
The label "x" is at (1,1.5), which is near the segment AB, maybe? The label "x" at (2,1) is near the trisectors from A to E, and the label "x" at (2,-1) is near the lower part. Similarly, labels "y" are near the trisectors from D to F. The given angles 110° and 100° are near points B and C, perhaps.
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
Wait, angle at A in triangle AFD is angle FAD, which is part of the trisection of angle BAD. Similarly, angle at D in triangle AFD is angle FDA, which is part of the trisection of angle ADC. If we can find those, then angle AFD is 180 minus the sum of those two.

But how to find angles FAD and FDA?
</execution_1.2>

<execution_1.3>
But maybe we can relate angles at B and C with the given angles in the diagram. Wait, in the Asymptote code, there are labels for 110 degrees at (2.5,3.5) and 100 degrees at (6.5,3.5). These are probably angles at points B and C? Let me see. The coordinates (2.5,3.5) is near point B(2,4), and (6.5,3.5) is near point C(7,4). So maybe angle ABC is 110 degrees and angle BCD is 100 degrees? Hmm, but angle ABC is at point B, between points A, B, C. Similarly, angle BCD is at point C, between points B, C, D.
</execution_1.3>
</Execution_1>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Let me try to parse the Asymptote code's labels:

- label("$x$", (1, 1.5)): This is somewhere in the middle of the left side, probably between AB and AD.
- label("$x$", (2, 1)): Closer to the x-axis, maybe near the first trisection mark from A.
- label("$x$", (2, -1)): Below the x-axis, near the lower part.
- Similarly, label("$y$", (5.5, 0.5)): On the right side, near the lower part.
- label("$y$", (6.5,0)): Closer to the x-axis on the right.
- label("$y$", (5, -1.5)): On the right side, lower part.

So, maybe angles at A are trisected into three x angles, and angles at D are trisected into three y angles. The given angles of 110° and 100° are probably angles at B and C? Let me see.

Let's see. To find angles FAD and FDA, maybe we can use the angles along the trisectors.

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
The label 110° is at (2.5,3.5), which is near the upper part of the figure, maybe between points B and C. The label 100° is at (6.5,3.5), which is near point C. Wait, but point C is at (7,4), so (6.5,3.5) is somewhere between C and D. Hmm, perhaps angle ABC is 110° and angle BCD is 100°?
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Since angles BAD and CDA are trisected, angle BAD is divided into three angles of x each, so angle BAE = angle EAF = angle FAD = x. Similarly, angle ADC is divided into three angles of y each: angle DAF (if F is near D) Wait, maybe not. Wait, point F is connected from A to F to D, so angle at D is split into three angles: angle ED F, D F A, and A D something? Wait, perhaps I need to clarify the configuration.

Wait, maybe the trisection at A is into three angles, each of x degrees, so angle BAE = x, angle EAF = x, angle FAD = x. Similarly, at D, angle ADC is trisected into three angles, each y degrees: angle ED F = y, angle F D something? Wait, maybe angle EDF = y, angle FDC = y, and another angle? Wait, perhaps angle ADC is split into three angles at D: angle EDF = y, angle FDC = y, and angle FD something else? Wait, this is getting confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the trisection at A is into three angles, each x, so angle BAC1 = x, angle C1AC2 = x, angle C2AD = x. Similarly, at D, the trisection is into three angles, each y: angle DBC3 = y, angle C3CD = y, angle C CD something? Wait, perhaps I need to refer back to the Asymptote code.

Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw A connected to E connected to D, and A connected to F connected to D. So, points E and F are on BD? Wait, no. Let me see the coordinates.

Point A is (0,0), B is (2,4), C is (7,4), D is (7,-2). So, BD is from (2,4) to (7,-2). Point E is at (4.3, 0.8), which is somewhere along BD? Wait, BD goes from (2,4) to (7,-2). The parametric equation of BD can be given by x = 2 + 5t, y = 4 -6t, for t from 0 to 1. If E is at (4.3, 0.8), then solving 2 +5t =4.3 gives t=0.46, and 4 -6*0.46=4 -2.76=1.24, but E's y-coordinate is 0.8, so that's not on BD. So E is not on BD. Similarly, F is at (5,3). Let's check if F is on BD. Plugging x=5 into BD's x equation: 2 +5t=5 => t=0.6. Then y=4 -6*0.6=4 -3.6=0.4. But F's y-coordinate is 3, so not on BD. So E and F are not on BD. Therefore, the trisectors from A to E and F are not along BD. Hmm, confusing.

Alternatively, maybe E is on AB and F is on AD? But E is at (4.3,0.8). AB is from (0,0) to (2,4). The parametric equation of AB is x=2t, y=4t. If E is (4.3,0.8), then 2t=4.3 => t=2.15, which is beyond the segment AB, since t should be between 0 and 1. So E is not on AB. Similarly, F is at (5,3). AD is from (0,0) to (7,-2). Parametric equation: x=7t, y=-2t. If F is (5,3), then 7t=5 => t≈0.714, and y=-2*0.714≈-1.428, but F's y-coordinate is 3, so not on AD. Therefore, E and F are not on the sides AB or AD. Therefore, the figure is a bit more complex.

Based on execution_2.1:
Alternatively, maybe angle ABC is 110°, which is at point B, between A, B, C. And angle BCD is 100°, at point C, between B, C, D. Then, angles at A and D are trisected. Let's see.

First, let's recall that the sum of the interior angles of quadrilateral ABCD is 360°. If angles at B and C are 110° and 100°, then angles at A and D must add up to 360 - (110 + 100) = 150°. So angle A + angle D = 150°. But angles at A and D are each trisected. However, trisected into how many parts? The problem says "angle BAD and angle CDA are trisected". So angle BAD is trisected, and angle CDA is trisected.

<prompt_3.1> Calculate the sum of the interior angles of quadrilateral ABCD and find angles at A and D. </prompt_3.1>

But maybe I can use the given angles at B and C to find angles at A and D.

<prompt_3.2> Use the given angles at B and C to find angles at A and D. </prompt_3.2>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
Therefore, angle BAD is divided into three equal angles, each of measure x, so angle BAD = 3x. Similarly, angle CDA is divided into three equal angles, each of measure y, so angle CDA = 3y. Therefore, 3x + 3y = 150°, which simplifies to x + y = 50°. So that's one equation.

Now, looking at the figure, points E and F are connected such that AE and AF trisect angle BAD, and FD trisects angle CDA? Wait, the Asymptote code draws A connected to E connected to D, so E is a point such that AE is one trisector, and ED is the other? Similarly, A connected to F connected to D, so AF and FD are the trisectors. Then, lines are drawn from E to D and from F to D. The angles at E and F might be related to the given 110° and 100°.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
Wait, sum of angles in quadrilateral is 360°, so angle A + angle B + angle C + angle D = 360°. If angles B and C are 110° and 100°, then angles A + D = 360 - 210 = 150°. So angle A + angle D = 150°. But angle A is trisected into three equal parts, so each trisection part is (angle A)/3. Similarly, angle D is trisected into three equal parts, each of (angle D)/3. However, without more information, how can we find angle AFD?

But ABCD is a quadrilateral, not necessarily a triangle. Alternatively, perhaps we can find angles at A and D by considering the triangles formed by the trisectors.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the Law of Sines or Law of Cosines in some triangles. Let's consider triangle AFD. To find angle AFD, we need to know angles at A and D in that triangle. But angle at A in triangle AFD is angle FAD, which is one of the trisected parts of angle BAD. Similarly, angle at D in triangle AFD is angle FDA, which is one of the trisected parts of angle ADC.

The given angles are 110° and 100°, which are at points B and C. The Asymptote code labels these angles at (2.5,3.5) and (6.5,3.5). So, point (2.5,3.5) is near the upper part of the figure, probably near point B(2,4), and (6.5,3.5) is near point C(7,4). So maybe angle ABC is 110°, and angle BCD is 100°. Then, in triangle ABC and triangle ADC, we can use these angles.

Wait, but ABCD is a quadrilateral, not necessarily a triangle. Let's see. If we can find angles at A and D, then we can proceed. But we know that angles at A and D sum to 150°, as angle A + angle D = 150°. However, we need more information to find individual measures.

But angles at A and D in triangle AFD are parts of the trisected angles at A and D. So angle FAD is one trisection part of angle BAD, and angle FDA is one trisection part of angle ADC. If we can find these, then angle AFD = 180° - (angle FAD + angle FDA).

But how to find angle FAD and angle FDA? Maybe using the given angles at B and C.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that the sum of angles around point E and point F is 360°, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, maybe considering triangle AFD and triangle EFD or something else. Wait, perhaps considering the entire quadrilateral and using the Law of Sines in triangles ABE, AED, etc. But without side lengths, this might be tricky.

Wait, but maybe the given angles of 110° and 100° can help. Let's see. If angle ABC is 110°, which is at point B, and angle BCD is 100°, at point C. Then, in triangle ABC, we can find angle BAC and angle BCA. Wait, but triangle ABC is part of the quadrilateral. Wait, ABCD is a quadrilateral, so points A, B, C, D are connected in order. So, triangle ABC is part of the quadrilateral. Similarly, triangle ADC is another part.

Wait, but if we can find angles at A and D in triangles ABC and ADC, maybe we can relate them to the trisected angles.

Alternatively, maybe using the concept of the angle between trisectors. Let's think.

If angle BAD is trisected into three angles of x each, then angle BAE = angle EAF = angle FAD = x. Similarly, angle ADC is trisected into three angles of y each, so angle ED F = angle FDC = angle CDF = y. Then, if we can find x and y, we can find angles at A and D, and then use that to find angle AFD.

But we need more relations between x and y. Earlier, we found that x + y = 50°, since 3x + 3y = 150°. So x + y = 50°. If we can find another equation relating x and y, we can solve for x and y.

Alternatively, maybe considering triangle AFD. If we can find angles at A and D in triangle AFD, then angle AFD is 180° minus the sum.

Wait, but how? Let's consider triangle AFD. The angles at A and D are parts of the trisected angles. So angle FAD = x, angle FDA = y. Then angle AFD = 180° - (x + y) = 180° - 50° = 130°. Wait, but that would be 130°, but the answer might be different. Wait, but is that correct?

Wait, if angle FAD is x and angle FDA is y, then angle AFD is 180 - (x + y). Since x + y = 50°, then angle AFD would be 130°. But is that the case?

Wait, but is angle FDA equal to y? Let's clarify.

<Plan_7>
Based on execution_6.1:
If angle ADC is trisected into three angles, each y°, then angle ADC = 3y. If point F is on AD such that angle FDA = y, then angle AFD would be 180 - (x + y). But is that the case?

<Execution_7>
<execution_7.1>
Wait, angle ADC is at point D, between points A, D, and C. If FD is one of the trisectors, then angle ADC is split into three angles at D: angle FDC = y, angle EDF = y, and angle ADE = y? Wait, perhaps not. Let me think.

Suppose angle ADC is trisected by DF and DE. Then, angle ADC is split into three angles: angle ADF = y, angle FDE = y, and angle EDC = y. So, angle ADC = 3y. Then, angle FDA is part of angle ADC. Wait, angle FDA is the angle at D between FD and A. If FD is one of the trisectors, then angle FDA would be y. Similarly, angle FAD is x. Therefore, in triangle AFD, angles at A and D are x and y, so angle AFD = 180 - (x + y) = 180 - 50 = 130°. But the problem states that angle AFD is to be found, and according to this, it would be 130°, but I need to verify if this is correct.

However, in the Asymptote code, there are labels for angles 110° and 100°, which are probably angles at B and C. If angle ABC is 110°, angle BCD is 100°, then angles at A and D must sum to 150°, as 360 - (110 + 100) = 150. Then, if angle AFD is 130°, that would be possible only if x + y = 50°, which is given. But maybe my assumption is wrong here.

Wait, but perhaps angle AFD is not directly x + y. Let me check. In triangle AFD, the angles at A and D are parts of the original angles at A and D. So angle FAD is x, angle FDA is y, so angle AFD is 180 - (x + y). Since x + y = 50°, then angle AFD is 130°. Therefore, the answer would be 130°, which is 180 - 50. But is there a way to confirm this?

Alternatively, maybe considering the diagram. If angle AFD is 130°, then the other angles around point F would need to add up appropriately. But perhaps the given angles at B and C (110° and 100°) are meant to be used in some way.

But without knowing the exact positions, it's hard to say. Alternatively, maybe considering the sum of angles in quadrilateral ABCD. If angles at B and C are 110 and 100, then angles at A and D are 150. But angles at A and D are trisected, so each trisection part is 50 and 50. Wait, no. Wait, angle A is trisected into three angles of x each, so angle A = 3x. Similarly, angle D is trisected into three angles of y each, so angle D = 3y. Then, 3x + 3y = 150, so x + y = 50. Therefore, in triangle AFD, angles at A and D are x and y, so angle AFD = 180 - (x + y) = 130°. Therefore, the answer is 130°, which would be 130 degrees. But let me check if this is correct.

Alternatively, maybe considering that angles at B and C are 110 and 100, which might form triangles with F. For example, point F is connected to E and D, but E is not on the sides. Wait, maybe considering triangle AFD and the angles around point F. The angles around point F would sum to 360°. But without knowing other angles, it's hard.

Alternatively, maybe the given angles at B and C (110 and 100) are part of triangles that include point F. For example, angle at B is 110°, which is angle ABC. If we can relate this angle to some angles in the figure involving F. But since F is inside the quadrilateral, perhaps through some triangle.

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that the sum of angles in triangle AFD is 180°, and if we can find x and y from the given angles.

Wait, but we already found that x + y = 50°, so angle AFD is 130°. Therefore, unless there's a miscalculation here, the answer should be 130°. But the problem might require a different approach because maybe the given angles at B and C are meant to be used.

Alternatively, perhaps the angles at B and C are part of other triangles that affect angle AFD. Let me try another approach.

Consider triangle AFD. To find angle AFD, we need angles at A and D. If we can find those angles, we can compute angle AFD. But angles at A and D in triangle AFD are parts of the original angles at A and D. Let's denote angle FAD = x (trisection part) and angle FDA = y (trisection part). Then, angle AFD = 180 - x - y. If we can find x and y, we can find angle AFD.

But how to find x and y? We know that angle ABC = 110° and angle BCD = 100°. Let's see if these can help.

Looking at angle ABC = 110°, which is at point B. In the quadrilateral ABCD, angle ABC is between points A, B, C. If we can relate this angle to some triangle involving F. Similarly, angle BCD = 100° at point C. Maybe considering triangles ABF, BCF, CDF, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps considering triangle BFC. Points B, F, C. But we need to know if F is connected to B and C. From the Asymptote code, F is connected to D, not directly to B and C. So maybe not.

Alternatively, maybe considering the straight lines. For example, line AF is drawn from A to F to D. So, AF is a straight line from A to F to D. Similarly, AE is from A to E to D. So, E and F are points along the trisectors.

Wait, perhaps using the concept of angle chasing. Let's try.

Starting from point A, angle BAD is trisected into three angles of x each. So angle BAE = x, angle EAF = x, angle FAD = x. Similarly, at point D, angle ADC is trisected into three angles of y each. Let's assume that angle EDF = y, angle FDC = y, angle CDF = y. Wait, but the labeling in the Asymptote code shows that labels y are at (2.3,0.5), (6.5,0), (5+0.5, -1.5+0.3). So maybe the trisectors at D are such that angle EDF = y, angle FDC = y, and angle ADF = y? Wait, perhaps not. Let me try to visualize.

If angle ADC is trisected, then starting from point D, the angles between DC and DF, between DF and DE, and between DE and DA are each y. So, angle EDF = y, angle FDE = y, angle ADE = y. Therefore, angle ADC = 3y. Similarly, at point A, angle BAD is trisected into angles BAE = x, angle EAF = x, angle FAD = x, so angle BAD = 3x.

Therefore, in triangle AFD, angles at A and D are x and y respectively. Therefore, angle AFD = 180 - x - y. Since x + y = 50°, angle AFD = 130°.

But let's check if this is consistent with the given angles at B and C (110° and 100°). The sum of angles in quadrilateral ABCD is 360°, so 3x + 110 + 3y + 100 = 360. Therefore, 3x + 3y = 150, which gives x + y = 50. So that's consistent. Therefore, angle AFD = 180 - (x + y) = 130°. Therefore, the measure of angle AFD is 130 degrees.
