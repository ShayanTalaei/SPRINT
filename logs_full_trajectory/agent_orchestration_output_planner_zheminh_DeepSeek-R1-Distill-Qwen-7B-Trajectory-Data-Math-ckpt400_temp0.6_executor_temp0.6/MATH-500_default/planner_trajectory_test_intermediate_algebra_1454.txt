For $0 \le x \le 40$ and $0 \le y \le 50,$ find the minimum value of
\[\sqrt{x^2 + 400} + \sqrt{y^2 + 900} + \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 - 80x - 100y + 4100}.\]
</Question>

<think>
<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to find the minimum value of this expression: √(x² + 400) + √(y² + 900) + √(x² + y² - 80x - 100y + 4100) where x is between 0 and 40, and y is between 0 and 50. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated with three square roots. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, maybe I should understand what each term represents. The first term is √(x² + 400).
That reminds me of the distance formula. Like, if you have a point (x, 20) because 20 squared is 400, then the distance from the origin (0,0) to (x, 20) would be √(x² + 400). Similarly, the second term is √(y² + 900).

<prompt_1.1> Analyze the second term of the expression and compare it to the first term. </prompt_1.1>

The third term is √(x² + y² - 80x - 100y + 4100). Let me try to simplify that expression under the square root. Maybe complete the square for x and y.

<prompt_1.2> Simplify the expression under the square root in the third term by completing the square. </prompt_1.2>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
Wait, 30 squared is 900, so maybe that's the distance from (0, 30) to (x, y)? Wait, no, hold on. If it's √(y² + 900), that would be the distance from (0, 30) to (0, y)? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, actually, if it's √(0² + (y - (-30))²), then that would be the distance from (0, -30) to (0, y). But maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, maybe it's the distance from (x, 0) to (0, 30)? Let me check: √((x - 0)² + (0 - 30)²) = √(x² + 900). Oh, right! So the second term is the distance from the point (x, 0) to (0, 30).
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
Let's see:

For the x terms: x² - 80x. To complete the square, take half of -80, which is -40, square it to get 1600. So x² -80x = (x -40)² -1600.

For the y terms: y² -100y. Similarly, half of -100 is -50, square is 2500. So y² -100y = (y -50)² -2500.

Putting that into the expression:

(x -40)² -1600 + (y -50)² -2500 +4100. Let's compute the constants: -1600 -2500 +4100 = (-4100) +4100 = 0. So the third term simplifies to √[(x -40)² + (y -50)²].

</Execution_1>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1, execution_1.2:
So putting it all together, the expression is the sum of three distances:

1. From (0, 0) to (x, 20) [first term]
2. From (x, 0) to (0, 30) [second term]
3. From (x, y) to (40, 50) [third term]

Wait, maybe I need to visualize this. Let me try to draw a mental picture.

<prompt_2.1> Visualize and describe the geometric scenario represented by the expression. </prompt_2.1>

But the variables x and y are constrained between 0 and 40 for x, and 0 and 50 for y. So x can go from 0 to 40, y from 0 to 50.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the variables are x and y, but the third distance is from (x, y) to (40, 50). So maybe the point (x, y) is somewhere in the plane, and we're measuring three distances: from (0,0) to (x,20), then from (x,0) to (0,30), then from (x,y) to (40,50). Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to interpret this as a path that goes from (0,0) to (x,20), then to (0,30), then to (40,50). But that seems forced.

<prompt_2.2> Consider alternative interpretations of the expression as a path and evaluate them. </prompt_2.2>
-----

Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe there's a geometric interpretation where we can reflect points to turn this into a straight line problem.

<prompt_2.3> Explore further geometric interpretations and reflection methods to find the minimum value. </prompt_2.3>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
There's a point (x, 20) whose distance from (0,0) is √(x² + 400). Then, there's a point (0,30) whose distance from (x,0) is √(x² + 900). Then, there's a point (40,50) whose distance from (x,y) is √[(x -40)² + (y -50)²].
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Wait, but the second term is √(y² + 900). Wait, if y is a variable, then √(y² + 900) would be the distance from (0, -30) to (0, y), but y is between 0 and 50. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the second term is the distance from (x, 0) to (0, 30), as I thought earlier, which would be √(x² + 900).
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
Let me think. In optimization problems involving sums of distances, reflecting points can help turn the problem into finding a straight line path, which would be the shortest distance.

For example, the classic problem of minimizing the sum of distances from a point to two fixed points is solved by reflecting a point across a line. Maybe something similar can be applied here.

Let me try to visualize the three terms again:

1. √(x² + 400) = distance from (0,0) to (x,20)
2. √(y² + 900) = distance from (x,0) to (0,30)
3. √[(x -40)² + (y -50)²] = distance from (x,y) to (40,50)

Wait, but how do these three terms connect? The first term is from (0,0) to (x,20), the second term is from (x,0) to (0,30), and the third term is from (x,y) to (40,50). It's a bit tricky because the variables x and y are shared between the terms. Maybe there's a way to represent this as a path that goes through certain points, and we need to find the minimal total length.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a path starting at (0,0), going to (x,20), then going to (0,30), then going to (40,50). But the problem is that between (0,0) to (x,20) and then from (x,20) to (0,30), but the second term is from (x,0) to (0,30). Wait, that doesn't align. Maybe my initial interpretation is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps all three terms are separate distances that need to be added, but they involve the same variables x and y. So maybe the problem is to minimize the sum of three distances: one from (0,0) to (x,20), another from (x,0) to (0,30), and a third from (x,y) to (40,50). But x and y are variables within their ranges. So perhaps we need to choose x and y such that this total sum is minimized.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to combine these terms into a single geometric problem. Let me try to think of each term as a segment in a path. For example, if we have a path from (0,0) to (x,20), then from (x,20) to (0,30), then from (0,30) to (40,50). Wait, but the third term is from (x,y) to (40,50), not from (0,30). Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the second term is the distance from (x,0) to (0,30), which is different from the path I just mentioned. Maybe the variables x and y are coordinates in different planes? That seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the variables x and y are the same in all terms. So x is between 0 and 40, y is between 0 and 50, and both are used in all three terms. So the three distances are:

1. From (0,0) to (x,20)
2. From (x,0) to (0,30)
3. From (x,y) to (40,50)

But how do these relate? Maybe the problem is to choose x and y such that the sum of these three distances is minimized. But x and y are independent variables, but they are used in different terms. Wait, but in the second term, it's √(y² + 900), which would be the distance from (0,30) to (0,y), but then the first term is from (0,0) to (x,20). Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to model a path that goes from (0,0) to (x,20), then to (x, y), then to (40,50), but that's not matching the terms. Wait, the second term is √(y² + 900). If that's the distance from (x,0) to (0,30), then maybe the point (x,0) is connected to (0,30), but how does that relate to the first term which is from (0,0) to (x,20)? This is getting a bit confusing.

Maybe I need to approach this algebraically. Let's denote the three terms as:

A = √(x² + 400)

B = √(y² + 900)

C = √[(x - 40)² + (y - 50)²]

We need to minimize A + B + C.

So we have three expressions involving x and y. Maybe we can use calculus to find the minimum. Let's consider taking partial derivatives with respect to x and y, set them to zero, and solve for x and y.

But before jumping into calculus, perhaps there's a geometric insight here. The expression A + B + C could represent the sum of three distances, which might be minimized when the path is straightened out via reflections.

Based on execution_2.3:
For instance, in problems where you have to minimize the sum of distances from a moving point to multiple fixed points, reflecting points across constraints (like lines or boundaries) can help transform the problem into finding a straight line path.

Let me try to visualize the points involved:

Based on execution_2.2:
Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the minimal network connecting these points with Steiner points. But perhaps reflecting points is the key here.

Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a path starting at (0,0), going to (x,20), then to (0,30), then to (40,50). Wait, but the distances would be:

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
- The first term, A = √(x² + 400), is the distance from the point (x, 20) to (0, 0).
- The second term, B = √(y² + 900), is the distance from the point (0, 30) to (0, y) if we consider vertical distance, but that doesn't involve x. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, if B is the distance from (x, 0) to (0, 30), which would be √(x² + 900).
- The third term, C = √[(x - 40)² + (y - 50)²], is the distance from (x, y) to (40, 50).

So maybe the problem is to find points (x, 20) and (x, y) such that the sum of these three distances is minimized. But how are these points connected? It's a bit unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find a point (x, y) such that the sum of these three distances is minimized. Wait, but the first distance is from (0,0) to (x,20), the second from (x,0) to (0,30), and the third from (x,y) to (40,50). So (x, y) is a variable point that affects all three terms. But how?

Alternatively, maybe we can consider that the first term is a function of x, the second term is a function of y, and the third term is a function of both x and y. So we have a function f(x, y) = √(x² + 400) + √(y² + 900) + √[(x -40)² + (y -50)²]. We need to find the minimum of f(x, y) for x in [0,40] and y in [0,50].
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
From (0,0) to (x,20): √(x² + 400)

From (x,20) to (0,30): √[(x - 0)² + (20 - 30)²] = √(x² + 100)

But that's not matching the second term which is √(y² + 900). Hmm.

Alternatively, if the second term is from (x,0) to (0,30), which is √(x² + 900), then maybe the point (x,0) is somewhere along the x-axis, and we're connecting (0,0) to (x,20), then from (x,0) to (0,30), and then from (x,y) to (40,50). But how do these connect? The variables x and y are shared. This is getting a bit tangled.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to minimize the sum of three separate distances:

1. From (0,0) to (x,20)
2. From (x,0) to (0,30)
3. From (x,y) to (40,50)

But x is between 0 and 40, y between 0 and 50. So x and y are variables, but in different coordinates. Maybe the first distance is vertical, the second is horizontal, and the third is another diagonal. But how do they relate? The total expression is A + B + C as defined.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to represent this as a network where we have to choose x and y such that the sum of these three distances is minimized. But I need a better approach.

Let me try to consider all three terms together.

We have A = √(x² + 400), B = √(y² + 900), C = √[(x -40)² + (y -50)²].

We need to minimize A + B + C with 0 ≤ x ≤40 and 0 ≤ y ≤50.

This is a function of two variables, x and y. To find the minimum, we can try taking partial derivatives with respect to x and y, set them to zero, and solve for x and y. Let's attempt that.

First, compute the partial derivative of the total expression with respect to x:

∂/∂x [√(x² + 400) + √(y² + 900) + √((x -40)² + (y -50)²)]

The derivative of A with respect to x is (x)/√(x² + 400).

The derivative of B with respect to x is 0.

The derivative of C with respect to x is (x -40)/√((x -40)² + (y -50)²).

Similarly, the partial derivative with respect to y is:

∂/∂y [√(x² + 400) + √(y² + 900) + √((x -40)² + (y -50)²)]

Derivative of A with respect to y is 0.

Derivative of B with respect to y is (y)/√(y² + 900).

Derivative of C with respect to y is (y -50)/√((x -40)² + (y -50)²).

To find the critical points, set both partial derivatives to zero:

1. (x)/√(x² + 400) + (x -40)/√((x -40)² + (y -50)²) = 0

2. (y)/√(y² + 900) + (y -50)/√((x -40)² + (y -50)²) = 0

Based on execution_3.1:
Let me think of x and y as variables in a plane, and we need to find the point (x, y) that minimizes the sum of these three distances.

But how can I approach this? Maybe using calculus, as I started earlier, but that might get complicated. Alternatively, maybe there's a geometric interpretation where the minimal sum occurs when the angles of incidence and reflection are equal, similar to the way light reflects off surfaces.

Alternatively, perhaps reflecting points across the boundaries of the allowed region (x=40, y=50) could help. For example, in problems where you have to go from one point to another via reflections, the shortest path can be found by reflecting the end point.

Let me try to think of this as a path problem. Suppose we have three segments:

<prompt_4.1> Apply reflection to transform the problem into finding a straight line path. </prompt_4.1>
-----

Based on execution_3.2:
Let me denote the third term as D = √((x -40)² + (y -50)²). Then, the two equations become:

1. x / √(x² + 400) = - (x -40) / D

2. y / √(y² + 900) = - (y -50) / D

This suggests that the ratios of the components of the gradients of A and C are equal, and similarly for B and C. This might imply that the angles between the vectors are related. Maybe there's a proportionality between x and y.

Let me square both equations to eliminate the square roots:

But how do these segments connect? If we imagine a path that goes from (0,0) to (x,20) to (x,0) to (0,30) to (x,y) to (40,50), but that seems convoluted. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find a point (x,y) such that the sum of these three distances is minimized, but the variables are intertwined.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the minimal total distance when moving through these points. Wait, maybe it's a Steiner tree problem where we need to connect multiple points with minimal total length. But with three points, it might be more complex.

Alternatively, maybe I can fix x and y and compute the sum, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe set x and y such that the derivatives are zero, as I started earlier.

1. (x²) / (x² + 400) = (x -40)² / D²

2. (y²) / (y² + 900) = (y -50)² / D²

Where D = √((x -40)² + (y -50)²).

Let me denote D² = (x -40)² + (y -50)².

Then, equation 1 becomes:

x² / (x² + 400) = (x -40)² / [(x -40)² + D²]

Wait, but D² is already (x -40)² + (y -50)², so substituting that:

x² / (x² + 400) = (x -40)² / [(x -40)² + (x -40)² + (y -50)²]

Wait, that seems messy. Maybe there's a better way. Let me denote:

Let’s denote term1 = x / √(x² + 400) = - (x -40)/D

Similarly, term2 = y / √(y² + 900) = - (y -50)/D

So from term1: [x / (x² + 400)]^(1/2) = [ (x -40) / D ] with a negative sign.

Wait, maybe squaring both sides would help.

From term1:

x² / (x² + 400) = (x -40)² / D²

y² / (y² + 900) = (y -50)² / D²

Alternatively, maybe reflecting (0,0) over x=40 and y=50? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, if we reflect the point (40,50) across the lines x=40 and y=50, but that might not help. Wait, perhaps reflecting the entire coordinate system.

Alternatively, let's consider the problem as a path from (0,0) to (x,20) to (0,30) to (40,50). Wait, but that's not a straight path. Alternatively, maybe the minimal path goes through certain reflections.

Wait, perhaps the key is to realize that the three terms can be represented as distances in a reflected coordinate system. For example, reflecting the point (40,50) across the boundaries to turn the path into a straight line.

Alternatively, let's try to model this as a path. Suppose we start at (0,0), go to (x,20), then to (0,30), then to (40,50). But the sum of these distances is what we need to minimize. However, the variables x and y are involved in different terms, so this might not align.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed by considering the points (0,0), (x,20), (0,30), and (40,50). But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal sum occurs when the angles formed at the point (x,y) satisfy certain reflection properties. For example, the angle between the incoming path and the outgoing path with respect to the x and y axes.

Wait, maybe if we consider the three terms as three separate distances, but they all involve x and y. Maybe we can set up equations based on the condition that the derivatives with respect to x and y are zero. Let's try that again.

From the partial derivatives:

1. x / √(x² + 400) = - (x -40) / √((x -40)² + (y -50)²)

2. y / √(y² + 900) = - (y -50) / √((x -40)² + (y -50)²)

Based on execution_4.2:
Let me denote D² = (x -40)^2 + (y -50)^2.

Then, equation 1:

x² / (x² + 400) = (x -40)^2 / [ (x -40)^2 + (y -50)^2 ]

Similarly, equation 2:

y² / (y² + 900) = (y -50)^2 / [ (x -40)^2 + (y -50)^2 ]

Let me denote equation 1 as:

x² / (x² + 400) = (x -40)^2 / [ (x -40)^2 + (y -50)^2 ] ... (1)

Similarly, equation 2:

y² / (y² + 900) = (y -50)^2 / [ (x -40)^2 + (y -50)^2 ] ... (2)

Let me denote the denominator in both equations as K = (x -40)^2 + (y -50)^2.

Then equation 1 becomes:

x² / (x² + 400) = (x -40)^2 / K

Similarly, equation 2:

y² / (y² + 900) = (y -50)^2 / K

Let me take the ratio of equation 1 to equation 2:

[ x² / (x² + 400) ] / [ y² / (y² + 900) ] = [ (x -40)^2 / K ] / [ (y -50)^2 / K ] = [ (x -40)^2 / (y -50)^2 ]

Therefore:

[ x² (y² + 900) ] / [ y² (x² + 400) ] = [ (x -40)^2 / (y -50)^2 ]

This seems complicated, but maybe we can make an assumption that x and y are proportional to the constants in the square roots. For example, in the first term, 20 is related to 400 (20² = 400), and in the second term, 30 is related to 900 (30² = 900). Perhaps x and y are 20 and 30? But x is between 0 and 40, y between 0 and 50, so 20 and 30 are within the ranges. Let me test x=20 and y=30.

Then, compute K = (20 -40)^2 + (30 -50)^2 = (-20)^2 + (-20)^2 = 400 + 400 = 800.

Then, check equation 1:

Left side: (20²) / (20² + 400) = 400 / (400 + 400) = 400/800 = 0.5

Right side: (20 -40)^2 / 800 = (-20)^2 / 800 = 400 / 800 = 0.5. So equation 1 holds.

Similarly, equation 2:

Left side: (30²) / (30² + 900) = 900 / (900 + 900) = 900/1800 = 0.5

Right side: (30 -50)^2 / 800 = (-20)^2 / 800 = 400 / 800 = 0.5. So equation 2 also holds.

So x=20, y=30 is a critical point. Therefore, this is a potential minimum.

From term1:

x² / (x² + 400) = (x -40)² / D²

Similarly, from term2:

y² / (y² + 900) = (y -50)² / D²

But D² = (x -40)² + (y -50)². Let's substitute that into the first equation:

x² / (x² + 400) = (x -40)² / [ (x -40)² + (y -50)² ]

Similarly for the second equation:

y² / (y² + 900) = (y -50)² / [ (x -40)² + (y -50)² ]

Let me denote A = (x -40)² and B = (y -50)². Then, D² = A + B.

Then, equation 1 becomes:

x² / (x² + 400) = A / (A + B)

Similarly, equation 2 becomes:

y² / (y² + 900) = B / (A + B)

Let me solve equation 1 for A/B.

From equation 1:

x² / (x² + 400) = A / (A + B)

Cross-multiplying:

x² (A + B) = A (x² + 400)

x² A + x² B = x² A + 400 A

Subtract x² A from both sides:

x² B = 400 A

Therefore:

A / B = x² / 400

Similarly, from equation 2:

y² / (y² + 900) = B / (A + B)

Cross-multiplying:

y² (A + B) = B (y² + 900)

y² A + y² B = y² B + 900 B

Subtract y² B from both sides:

y² A = 900 B

Therefore:

A / B = 900 / y²

But from equation 1, A/B = x² / 400. Therefore:

x² / 400 = 900 / y²

Cross-multiplying:

x² y² = 400 * 900 = 360,000

Therefore:

xy = √360,000 = √(36 * 10,000) = 6 * 100 = 600

So we have the condition that x * y = 600. That's one equation.

Based on execution_5.2:
Now, recall that A = (x -40)^2 and B = (y -50)^2, and from equation 1, A/B = x² /400. So:

A = (x² /400) * B

But since A + B = D², we can write:

(x² /400) * B + B = D²

B (x² /400 + 1) = D²

But B = (y -50)^2, so:

(y -50)^2 (x² /400 + 1) = D²

But D² is also (x -40)^2 + (y -50)^2. Therefore:

(y -50)^2 (x² /400 + 1) = (x -40)^2 + (y -50)^2

Let me divide both sides by (y -50)^2:

x² /400 + 1 = [(x -40)^2 + (y -50)^2] / (y -50)^2

Simplify the right side:

= [(x -40)^2 / (y -50)^2] + 1

Therefore:

x² /400 + 1 = [(x -40)^2 / (y -50)^2] + 1

Subtract 1 from both sides:

x² /400 = (x -40)^2 / (y -50)^2

Cross-multiplying:

x² (y -50)^2 = 400 (x -40)^2

But from earlier, we have x * y = 600, so y = 600 / x. Let's substitute y = 600/x into this equation.

Based on execution_5.1:
Let me check if this is indeed a minimum. To confirm, we can check the second derivatives or test values around x=20, y=30, but given the problem's structure, it's likely the minimal point.

<prompt_6.2> Verify if the point (20, 30) is within the given constraints and confirm if it is a minimum. </prompt_6.2>
</Plan_6>

<Execution_6>
<execution_6.1>
First, let's note that y = 600/x. So:

x² ( (600/x) -50 )² = 400 (x -40)^2

Simplify the left side:

x² [ (600 -50x)/x ]² = x² * ( (600 -50x)^2 ) / x² = (600 -50x)^2

Therefore, left side simplifies to (600 -50x)^2.

Right side: 400 (x -40)^2

Therefore:

(600 -50x)^2 = 400 (x -40)^2

Take square roots on both sides (considering both positive and negative roots):

600 -50x = ±√400 (x -40) = ±20 (x -40)

So two cases:

1. 600 -50x = 20(x -40)
2. 600 -50x = -20(x -40)

Solve case 1:

600 -50x = 20x -800

600 +800 = 20x +50x

1400 = 70x

x = 1400 /70 = 20

So x=20, then y=600/20=30. So that's the solution we found earlier.

Case 2:

600 -50x = -20x +800

600 -800 = -20x +50x

-200 = 30x

x = -200/30 = -20/3 ≈ -6.666...

But x must be between 0 and 40, so this solution is invalid. Therefore, the only critical point is x=20, y=30.

First, check if x=20 is within [0,40], yes. y=30 is within [0,50], yes. Then, compute the total distance:

First term: √(20² + 400) = √(400 + 400) = √800 = 20√2 ≈ 28.2843

Second term: √(30² + 900) = √(900 + 900) = √1800 = 30√2 ≈ 42.4264

Third term: √[(20-40)² + (30-50)²] = √[(-20)² + (-20)²] = √(400 + 400) = √800 = 20√2 ≈ 28.2843

Total sum: 20√2 + 30√2 + 20√2 = 70√2 ≈ 98.9949

<Plan_7>
Based on execution_6.2:
Let me verify if this is indeed the minimum. Since the function is smooth and the critical point is the only one within the domain, and given that the function likely has a unique minimum here, this should be the minimum value. Also, 70√2 is approximately 98.9949, which seems reasonable given the distances involved.

To confirm, let's check the boundaries. For example, if x=0, then the first term is √(0 + 400)=20, the second term would be √(y² +900), and the third term would be √((0-40)² + (y-50)²). It's likely that the sum at the boundaries would be larger than 70√2, but let's check one example.

<prompt_7.1> Check the boundary cases and confirm that the critical point (20, 30) gives the minimal value. </prompt_7.1>

The minimum value is \boxed{70\sqrt{2}}.
