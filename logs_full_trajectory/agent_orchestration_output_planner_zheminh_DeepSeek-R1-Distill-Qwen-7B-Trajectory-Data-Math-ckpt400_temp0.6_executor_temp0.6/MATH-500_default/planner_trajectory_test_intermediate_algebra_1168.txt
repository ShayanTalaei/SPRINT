<Question>
Riproarin' Ringo was roping a recalcitrant dogie. Ringo decided to give the dogie a reprieve by calculating \[|(1-i)^8|\]before riding after the dogie. What answer should Ringo have found?

Okay, let's see. Ringo needs to calculate the absolute value of (1 - i)^8. Hmm, complex numbers can be tricky, but maybe I can break it down step by step. First, I remember that the absolute value (or modulus) of a complex number raised to a power can be simplified using properties of exponents and moduli.

<prompt_1.1> Recall the property of modulus for a complex number raised to a power and verify its application to (1 - i)^8. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
Let me start by recalling the formula for the modulus of a complex number. If I have a complex number z = a + bi, its modulus is |z| = sqrt(a² + b²). Also, when you raise a complex number to a power, the modulus of the result is the modulus of the original number raised to that power. So, |z^n| = |z|^n. That seems right. So, maybe I can first find the modulus of (1 - i), then raise that to the 8th power. That would simplify things a lot instead of expanding (1 - i)^8 manually.

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Let me check that. If z is a complex number and n is an integer, then |z^n| = |z|^n. Yes, that's a property of complex numbers.

So, first, compute |1 - i|.

<prompt_2.1> Calculate the modulus of (1 - i) and use it to find |(1 - i)^8|. </prompt_2.1>

Wait, is that correct? Let me verify another way to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a mistake.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute (1 - i)^2 first, then take the modulus, and see if it matches |1 - i|^2.

<prompt_2.2> Verify the result by computing (1 - i)^2, taking its modulus, and comparing it to |1 - i|^2. </prompt_2.2>

Let me try expanding (1 - i)^8. Maybe that's a good cross-check. Although expanding it directly might be tedious, but perhaps using binomial theorem. Let's see.

<prompt_2.3> Expand (1 - i)^8 using the binomial theorem and verify the result. </prompt_2.3>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
For z = 1 - i, a = 1, b = -1. So, |1 - i| = sqrt(1² + (-1)²) = sqrt(1 + 1) = sqrt(2). Then, |(1 - i)^8| = |1 - i|⁸ = (sqrt(2))⁸. Let's compute that. (sqrt(2))² is 2, so (sqrt(2))⁸ is (2)^4, which is 16. Therefore, the answer should be 16.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Let's see. (1 - i)^2 = 1² - 2*1*i + (i)^2 = 1 - 2i + (-1) = 0 - 2i = -2i. The modulus of that is sqrt(0² + (-2)^2) = 2. On the other hand, |1 - i| is sqrt(1² + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2), and raising that to the 2nd power gives (sqrt(2))^2 = 2. So that matches.
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
First, (1 - i)^2. Let's compute that:

(1 - i)^2 = 1^2 - 2*1*i + (i)^2 = 1 - 2i + (-1) = (1 - 1) - 2i = 0 - 2i = -2i.

So, (1 - i)^2 = -2i. Then, (1 - i)^4 would be [ (1 - i)^2 ]^2 = (-2i)^2 = (-2)^2*(i)^2 = 4*(-1) = -4.

Similarly, (1 - i)^8 would be [ (1 - i)^4 ]^2 = (-4)^2 = 16.

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1, execution_2.2, execution_2.3:
Therefore, the modulus is |16| = 16.
So, this confirms the earlier result.

Alternatively, if I convert (1 - i) to polar form, maybe that would also help. Polar form is r*(cosθ + i sinθ), where r is the modulus and θ is the argument. Then, raising it to the 8th power would be r^8*(cos(8θ) + i sin(8θ)), and the modulus would be r^8.
Since the modulus of a complex number in polar form is just the magnitude r, so regardless of the angle, the modulus of (r*(cosθ + i sinθ))^n is r^n.

So, let's try that approach. For (1 - i), modulus is sqrt(1 + 1) = sqrt(2), argument θ is arctan( (-1)/1 ) = -π/4 (since it's in the fourth quadrant). So, (1 - i) can be written as sqrt(2)*(cos(-π/4) + i sin(-π/4)). Then, raising this to the 8th power gives (sqrt(2))^8 * [cos(8*(-π/4)) + i sin(8*(-π/4))].

<prompt_3.1> Convert (1 - i) to polar form and use De Moivre's theorem to find (1 - i)^8. </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
Calculating the modulus part: (sqrt(2))^8 = (2^(1/2))^8 = 2^(4) = 16. The angle becomes 8*(-π/4) = -2π. Cos(-2π) + i sin(-2π) is cos(2π) - i sin(2π) = 1 - 0 = 1. So, the result is 16*(1) = 16. Therefore, modulus is 16.

Based on execution_3.1:
Another way to check: if I compute (1 - i)^8 step by step. Let's see:

<prompt_4.1> Confirm the result by computing (1 - i)^8 step by step. </prompt_4.1>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
(1 - i)^1 = 1 - i

(1 - i)^2 = (1 - i)*(1 - i) = 1 - 2i + i² = 1 - 2i -1 = -2i

(1 - i)^3 = (1 - i)^2*(1 - i) = (-2i)*(1 - i) = -2i + 2i² = -2i -2 = -2 - 2i

(1 - i)^4 = (1 - i)^3*(1 - i) = (-2 - 2i)*(1 - i) = -2*(1 - i) -2i*(1 - i) = -2 + 2i -2i + 2i² = -2 + 0i -2 = -4

(1 - i)^5 = (1 - i)^4*(1 - i) = (-4)*(1 - i) = -4 + 4i

(1 - i)^6 = (1 - i)^5*(1 - i) = (-4 + 4i)*(1 - i) = -4*(1 - i) + 4i*(1 - i) = -4 + 4i + 4i -4i² = -4 + 8i +4 = 0 + 8i = 8i

(1 - i)^7 = (1 - i)^6*(1 - i) = 8i*(1 - i) = 8i -8i² = 8i +8 = 8 + 8i

(1 - i)^8 = (1 - i)^7*(1 - i) = (8 + 8i)*(1 - i) = 8*(1 - i) +8i*(1 - i) = 8 -8i +8i -8i² = 8 +0i +8 =16

Yes, that's 16. So, again, modulus is 16.

<Plan_5>
Based on execution_4.1:
Wait, let me check that last expansion again. (8 + 8i)*(1 - i):

<prompt_5.1> Recheck the expansion of (8 + 8i)*(1 - i) to ensure the result is correct. </prompt_5.1>
</Plan_5>

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
= 8*1 + 8*(-i) +8i*1 +8i*(-i)

= 8 -8i +8i -8i²

The -8i +8i cancels out, leaving 8 -8i². Since i² = -1, this becomes 8 -8*(-1) = 8 +8 =16.

<Plan_6>
Based on execution_5.1:
So, after all these methods—modulus properties, binomial expansion, polar form with De Moivre's theorem, step-by-step expansion—the result is consistently 16.
Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 16.

No prompt to execute.

<Final_answer>
Thus, the final answer is $\boxed{16}$.
