A pirate searches seven islands for buried treasure. If each island has a $\frac{1}{5}$ chance of having treasure, what is the probability that exactly 4 of the islands have treasure?
</Question>

<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to find the probability that exactly 4 out of 7 islands have treasure, and each island has a 1/5 chance of having treasure. Hmm, let me think. 

First, probability problems can sometimes be tricky, but they often involve combinations and probabilities multiplied together. Since each island is independent—meaning the presence of treasure on one doesn't affect another—their probabilities multiply. But since we want exactly 4 to have treasure and the remaining 3 not to, I should use the binomial probability formula, right?

<prompt_1.1> Recall and outline the binomial probability formula and determine if it applies to this problem. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
The binomial formula is used when there are a fixed number of independent trials, each with two possible outcomes (success or failure), and we want the probability of having exactly k successes in n trials. The formula is P(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k). 

In this case, a "success" would be finding treasure on an island, which has a probability p = 1/5. The "failure" would be not finding treasure, which would then have a probability of 1 - p = 4/5. The number of trials n is 7 islands, and we want exactly k = 4 successes.

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
So plugging the numbers into the formula, it should be C(7, 4) * (1/5)^4 * (4/5)^3. Let me check if that makes sense.

<prompt_2.1> Verify the setup of the binomial probability formula with the given parameters. </prompt_2.1>

First, I need to calculate the combination C(7, 4), which is the number of ways to choose 4 islands out of 7. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n!

<prompt_2.2> Calculate the combination C(7, 4) using the factorial formula. </prompt_2.2>

Next, (1/5)^4.
Let me compute that. (1/5)^1 is 1/5, squared is 1/25, cubed is 1/125, fourth power is 1/625. So that's 1/625.

Then, (4/5)^3.

<prompt_2.3> Calculate (1/5)^4 and (4/5)^3. </prompt_2.3>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Each island is independent, so the probabilities multiply. We need exactly 4 treasures, so 4 successes and 3 failures. The combination part accounts for all the different ways this can happen. For example, the treasure could be on the first 4 islands and none on the 7th, or the last 4, etc. So the combination factor is correct.

<execution_2.2>
/ (k! (n - k)! ). So C(7, 4) = 7! / (4! * (7 - 4)! ) = 7! / (4! * 3! ). Let me compute that. 

7! is 7*6*5*4*3*2*1 = 5040. 4! is 24, and 3! is 6. So 24*6 = 144. Then 5040 / 144. Let me divide 5040 by 144. 

144*35 = 5040, right? Because 144*30 = 4320, and 144*5 = 720, so 4320 + 720 = 5040. So 35. So C(7, 4) is 35.
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
Let's compute that. 4/5 cubed is 4^3 / 5^3 = 64 / 125. 

So multiplying all these together: C(7,4) * (1/625) * (64/125). Let me compute each part step by step.
</execution_2.3>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.2, execution_2.3:
First, multiply 1/625 by 64/125. Let's see. The numerators are 1*64 = 64, and denominators are 625*125. What's 625*125? Let me compute that.
625 is 25*25, and 125 is 25*5. So 625*125 = 25*25*25*5 = 25^3 *5. Wait, 25^3 is 15625, so 15625*5 = 78125. So 625*125 = 78125. Therefore, 1/625 * 64/125 = 64 / 78125.

Then, multiply that by 35. So 35 * (64 / 78125). Let me compute 35*64 first.

<prompt_3.1> Multiply 35 by 64 and divide by 78125 to find the final probability. </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
35*64. 35*60 = 2100, 35*4=140, so 2100+140=2240. So 2240 / 78125. 

Now, let me simplify that fraction. Let's see if 2240 and 78125 have a common divisor. 

First, factor 2240. 2240 divided by 10 is 224, so 224*10 = 2240. 224 is 32*7, so 32*7*10 = 2^5 * 5 *7. So prime factors are 2^5, 5, 7. 

Now, 78125. That's 5^7, because 5^7 is 78125. 5*5=25, 25*5=125, 125*5=625, 625*5=3125, 3125*5=15625, 15625*5=78125. So 5^7. 

So the denominator is 5^7, numerator is 2^5 *5*7. So we can cancel one 5. So 2240 / 78125 = (2^5 *7)/5^6. 

Let me compute that. 5^6 is 15625. 2^5 is 32. So 32*7 = 224. So 224 / 15625. 

Let me check if that reduces further. 224 is 32*7, 15625 is 5^6. No common factors, so 224/15625 is the simplified fraction.

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
To convert that to a decimal, let's divide 224 by 15625. Let me see.

<prompt_4.1> Convert the probability from the fraction 224/15625 to a decimal. </prompt_4.1>

So approximately 1.4304%.

Wait, but let me confirm that multiplication again. 35 * 64 = 2240.

<prompt_4.2> Re-evaluate the multiplication and confirm the probability calculation. </prompt_4.2>

But let me check if I made a mistake in the combination. C(7,4) is 35. Let's verify: 7 choose 4 is the same as 7 choose 3 (since C(n,k) = C(n, n-k)), and 7 choose 3 is 35 as well. Wait, no, 7 choose 3 is 35? Let me compute 7 choose 3.

<prompt_4.3> Verify the combination calculation using both C(7,4) and C(7,3) methods. </prompt_4.3>

Let me check the multiplication again. 35 * 64. Let's do 35*60=2100, 35*4=140, so 2100+140=2240.

<prompt_4.4> Re-check the multiplication and simplification steps of the probability calculation. </prompt_4.4>

Alternatively, maybe use decimal multiplication. Let's see. 1/5 is 0.2, 4/5 is 0.8. So (0.2)^4 = 0.0016, (0.8)^3 = 0.512. Then 35 * 0.0016 * 0.512.

<prompt_4.5> Use decimal multiplication to verify the probability calculation. </prompt_4.5>

Alternatively, 224 divided by 15625. Let's compute 15625 * 0.014 = 218.75. Because 15625*0.01=156.25, so 0.01*15625=156.25, so 0.014*15625=156.25*1.4=156.25+78.125=234.375. But 224 is less than that. So 0.014 would be 234.375, which is higher than 224. So subtract the difference.

<prompt_4.6> Perform a final verification of the probability calculation and confirm the result. </prompt_4.6>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
15625 goes into 224 how many times? 0. Let's add a decimal point and some zeros: 224.000000... 

15625 goes into 22400 once (since 15625*1=15625). Subtract that from 22400: 22400 - 15625 = 6775. Bring down the next 0: 67750. 15625 goes into 67750 four times (15625*4=62500). Subtract: 67750 - 62500 = 5250. Bring down the next 0: 52500. 15625 goes into 52500 three times (15625*3=46875). Subtract: 52500 - 46875 = 5625. Bring down the next 0: 56250. 15625 goes into 56250 three times (15625*3=46875). Subtract: 56250 - 46875 = 9375. Bring down the next 0: 93750. 15625 goes into 93750 six times (15625*6=93750). Subtract: 0. So putting it all together, we have 0.014304.
</execution_4.1>

<execution_4.2>
Yes. Then 35*64/78125 = 2240/78125. Yes. Then simplifying, 2240 divided by 78125. 

Alternatively, maybe compute the decimal directly. Let's try that. 2240 divided by 78125. Let's see how many times 78125 goes into 2240. 

78125 * 0.028 = 2187.5, because 78125 * 0.01 = 781.25, so 0.028 is 781.25 * 2.8. Wait, 781.25 * 2 = 1562.5, 781.25 * 0.8 = 625, so 1562.5 + 625 = 2187.5. So 0.028 * 78125 = 2187.5. Then 2240 - 2187.5 = 52.5. So 52.5 / 78125 = 0.000672. So total is 0.028 + 0.000672 = 0.028672. Wait, but 0.028 * 78125 = 2187.5, so 2240 / 78125 = 0.028672. So approximately 0.028672, which is 2.8672%. Wait, but that contradicts the previous result. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. 

Wait, 2240 divided by 78125. Let me do this division step by step. 

78125 goes into 2240 zero times. Add a decimal point, then add zeros. 78125 goes into 22400 0 times. 78125 goes into 224000 2 times (2*78125=156250). Subtract 156250 from 224000: 224000 - 156250 = 67750. Bring down the next zero: 677500. 78125 goes into 677500 8 times (8*78125=625000). Subtract: 677500 - 625000 = 52500. Bring down a zero: 525000. 78125 goes into 525000 6 times (6*78125=468750). Subtract: 525000 - 468750 = 56250. Bring down a zero: 562500. 78125 goes into 562500 7 times (7*78125=546875). Subtract: 562500 - 546875 = 15625. Bring down a zero: 156250. 78125 goes into 156250 exactly 2 times. 

So putting it all together: 0.028672. Wait, so 0.028672. So approximately 2.8672%. But earlier, when I simplified 224/15625, I thought that was 1.4304%. Wait, that can't be. There's a discrepancy here. 

Wait, 224 divided by 15625. Let me compute 15625 * 0.014 = 218.75. 15625 * 0.0144 = 15625*0.01=156.25, 15625*0.004=62.5, 15625*0.0004=6.25. So 156.25 + 62.5 + 6.25 = 225. So 0.0144*15625=225. But we have 224, which is 1 less. So 224 is 225 -1, so 0.0144 - (1/15625). 1/15625 is 0.000064. So 0.0144 - 0.000064 = 0.014336. So approximately 0.014336, which is 1.4336%. 

But when I did the division of 2240/78125, I got 0.028672, which is about 2.8672%. Wait, but 2240/78125 is equal to (224/15625)/5? Wait, no. Wait, 2240/78125 is equal to (224/78125)*10. Wait, no, 2240/78125 = (224*10)/(78125) = (224/78125)*10. But 224/78125 is 0.0028672, multiplied by 10 is 0.028672. 

But 224/15625 is 0.014336, which is 1.4336%. So 2240/78125 is 0.028672, which is 2.8672%. 

Wait, so which one is correct? Let's check the math again. 

Original calculation: C(7,4) = 35. Then (1/5)^4 = 1/625, and (4/5)^3 = 64/125. Then multiply them all together: 35 * (1/625) * (64/125). 

So 35 * 64 = 2240. Then 625 * 125 = 78125. So 2240 / 78125. So that's 0.028672, which is approximately 2.8672%. 

But when I simplified 2240/78125, I thought of it as 224/15625, but 2240 divided by 78125 is the same as 224 divided by 7812.5, but since we can't have a decimal in the denominator, it's better to keep it as 2240/78125. However, 2240 and 78125 can both be divided by 5: 2240 ÷5=448, 78125 ÷5=15625. So 448/15625. Then 448 divided by 15625. Let me compute that. 

15625 * 0.028 = 437.5, as before. 448 - 437.5 = 10.5. So 10.5 / 15625 = 0.000672. So total is 0.028 + 0.000672 = 0.028672, which is 2.8672%. 

But when I simplified 2240/78125 by dividing numerator and denominator by 5, I get 448/15625. Then 448 divided by 15625. Let me check that division again. 

15625 * 0.028 = 437.5. 448 - 437.5 = 10.5. 10.5 / 15625 = 0.000672. So 0.028 + 0.000672 = 0.028672. 

So the probability is 2240/78125, which is approximately 2.8672%. 

But let me verify once more. Maybe use decimal multiplication as I did before. 

0.2^4 = 0.0016, 0.8^3 = 0.512. 35 * 0.0016 = 0.056. Then 0.056 * 0.512. Let's compute that. 0.056 * 0.5 = 0.028, 0.056 * 0.012 = 0.000672. So total is 0.028 + 0.000672 = 0.028672. 

Yes, that's the same as before. So 0.028672, which is 2.8672%. 

So the exact fraction is 2240/78125, which can be simplified by dividing numerator and denominator by 5, resulting in 448/15625. Let me check if that can be simplified further. 448 is 64*7, 15625 is 5^6. So no common factors. So 448/15625 is the simplified fraction. 

Alternatively, as a decimal, it's approximately 0.028672, or 2.8672%. 

So, to recap: the probability is C(7,4)*(1/5)^4*(4/5)^3 = 35*(1/625)*(64/125) = 35*64/(625*125) = 2240/78125 = 448/15625 ≈ 0.028672, which is approximately 2.87%.
</execution_4.2>

<execution_4.3>
7*6*5/(3*2*1) = 35. Yes, that's correct. So C(7,4)=35. 

Then (1/5)^4 is 1/625, and (4/5)^3 is 64/125. Then 1/625 * 64/125 is 64/78125. Then 35*64/78125 is 2240/78125. Which simplifies to 224/15625. 

Yes, that seems right.
</execution_4.3>

<execution_4.4>
Then 64/78125 *35. So 64*35=2240. Then 2240/78125. Yes, that's right. Then simplifying, as above, gives 224/15625. 

Alternatively, 2240 divided by 78125. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 5: 2240 ÷5=448, 78125 ÷5=15625. So 448/15625. Then divide numerator and denominator by 7: 448 ÷7=64, 15625 ÷7≈2232.14, which is not an integer. Wait, 15625 divided by 7: 7*2232=15624, so 15625/7=2232 +1/7. So 448/15625 = 64*7 / (15625) = 64/ (15625/7) = 64/(2232.142... ), which is not helpful. So maybe 448/15625 is the simplified form. Wait, but 448 and 15625. Let's check if they have a common divisor. 448 is 64*7, 15625 is 5^6. So no common divisors. So 448/15625 is the simplified fraction, which is equal to 224/7812.5, but since denominators can't be decimals, perhaps 448/15625 is the simplest. Wait, but 448 divided by 15625. Let me check 448/15625. Let me compute that division. 

448 ÷ 15625. Let's see, 15625 goes into 448 zero times. Add a decimal point, add zeros. 15625 goes into 4480 zero times. 15625 goes into 44800 two times (2*15625=31250). Subtract 31250 from 44800: 13550. Bring down the next zero: 135500. 15625 goes into 135500 eight times (8*15625=125000). Subtract: 135500-125000=10500. Bring down a zero: 105000. 15625 goes into 105000 six times (6*15625=93750). Subtract: 105000-93750=11250. Bring down a zero: 112500. 15625 goes into 112500 seven times (7*15625=109375). Subtract: 112500-109375=3125. Bring down a zero: 31250. 15625 goes into 31250 exactly two times. So putting it all together: 0.02816. Wait, let's see:

First division: 448 ÷15625 = 0.02816... 

Wait, let's do it step by step.

448 ÷ 15625:

15625 × 0.02 = 312.5

So 0.02 gives 312.5. 448 - 312.5 = 135.5. So 0.02 + (135.5 /15625). 

135.5 /15625 = 0.008672. So total is approximately 0.028672. Wait, but when I did the long division earlier, I got 0.02816. Hmm, maybe I miscalculated. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I confused the steps. Let me do 448 ÷ 15625 step by step.

Since 15625 × 0.01 = 156.25

So 0.01 gives 156.25. How many times does 156.25 go into 448? 

448 ÷ 156.25 = approximately 2.86 times. So 2 times 156.25 = 312.5. Subtract from 448: 448 - 312.5 = 135.5. So that's 0.02 so far. Then, 135.5 ÷ 15625 = 0.008672. So total is 0.02 + 0.008672 = 0.028672. So approximately 0.028672, which is about 2.8672%.

Wait, but earlier when I did 224/15625, let me check that. 224 ÷ 15625. Let's compute 15625 × 0.014 = 218.75. So 0.014 gives 218.75. 224 - 218.75 = 5.25. So 5.25 /15625 = 0.000336. So total is 0.014 + 0.000336 = 0.014336. Wait, this is conflicting with the previous result. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in simplifying the fraction. Let me go back.

Original fraction was 2240 / 78125. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 5: 2240 ÷5=448, 78125 ÷5=15625. So 448/15625. So 448 ÷15625. Let me compute this division properly.

15625 × 0.02 = 312.5

448 - 312.5 = 135.5

15625 × 0.008 = 125

135.5 -125 =10.5

15625 × 0.0006 =9.375

10.5 -9.375=1.125

15625 ×0.00007=1.09375

1.125 -1.09375=0.03125

So adding up the parts: 0.02 +0.008+0.0006+0.00007≈0.02867. So approximately 0.02867, which is 2.867%.

But when I did 224/15625, that would be 224 ÷15625. Let me compute that:

15625 ×0.014=218.75

224 -218.75=5.25

So 5.25 /15625=0.000336

So total is 0.014 +0.000336=0.014336, which is 1.4336%. Wait, this discrepancy is confusing. 

Wait, perhaps I messed up the simplification. Let me retrace. Original probability is (35)*(1/5)^4*(4/5)^3. Let's compute this step by step.
</execution_4.4>

<execution_4.5>
First, 0.0016 * 0.512. Let's compute that. 0.0016 * 0.5 = 0.0008, and 0.0016 * 0.012 = 0.0000192. So adding those together: 0.0008 + 0.0000192 = 0.0008192. Then multiply by 35. 0.0008192 * 35. Let's do 0.0008 * 35 = 0.028, and 0.0000192 *35=0.000672. Adding those: 0.028 + 0.000672 = 0.028672. 

Wait, but 0.028672 is approximately 2.8672%. But when I converted 224/15625, let me check that. 15625 * 0.014 = 218.75, as before. 224 - 218.75 = 5.25. So 5.25 / 15625 = 0.000336. So total is 0.014 + 0.000336 = 0.014336, which is approximately 1.4336%. Hmm, but this is conflicting with the previous decimal multiplication. 

Wait, there's a discrepancy here. Let me check the decimal multiplication again. 

First, 0.2^4 = 0.0016, correct. 0.8^3 = 0.512, correct. Then 0.0016 * 0.512. Let's compute 0.0016 * 0.512. 

0.0016 * 0.5 = 0.0008. 0.0016 * 0.012 = 0.0000192. So total is 0.0008 + 0.0000192 = 0.0008192. Then multiply by 35: 0.0008192 * 35. 

Let's compute 0.0008192 * 10 = 0.008192, times 3.5 (since 35 is 3.5*10). So 0.008192 * 3.5. 

0.008192 * 3 = 0.024576, and 0.008192 * 0.5 = 0.004096. Adding those gives 0.024576 + 0.004096 = 0.028672. 

So 0.028672 is 2.8672%. But when I did 224/15625, 224 divided by 15625: Let's do this division step by step. 

15625 * 0.01 = 156.25, so 0.01 is 156.25. 224 / 15625 = (224 / 156.25) * 0.01. Let's compute 224 / 156.25. 

156.25 * 1.4 = 220.5, which is close to 224. 224 - 220.5 = 3.5. So 1.4 + (3.5 / 156.25). 3.5 / 156.25 = 0.0224. So total is approximately 1.4224. Then multiply by 0.01: 0.014224. So approximately 0.014224, which is 1.4224%. 

But this is conflicting with the decimal multiplication which gave 2.8672%. Wait, that can't be. There must be a mistake here. Let me check where.

Wait, maybe this is getting too convoluted. Alternatively, just do 224 divided by 15625. Let's do this division step by step. 

15625 goes into 224 zero times. Add a decimal point, add zeros: 2240 divided by 15625. 15625*0.014 is 218.75, as before. So 224 - 218.75 = 5.25. Bring down a zero: 52.5. 15625 goes into 52.5 about 0.00336 times? Wait, maybe this is not the right approach. 

Alternatively, 224 / 15625. Let me write this as (224 / 1000) / (15625 / 1000) = 0.224 / 15.625. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, note that 15625 * 14 = 220,000. Wait, no. 15625 * 14 = 15625*10 + 15625*4 = 156250 + 62500 = 218750. But 224 is much smaller. 

Wait, perhaps I should just use a calculator approach. 224 ÷ 15625. Let's compute 224 ÷ 15625. 

15625 × 0.014 = 218.75, as before. So 0.014 gives 218.75. The difference between 224 and 218.75 is 5.25. So 5.25 / 15625 = 0.000336. So total is 0.014 + 0.000336 = 0.014336. So approximately 0.014336, which is 1.4336%. 

So approximately 1.43%.
