Okay, so I need to find the vertical asymptotes and the horizontal asymptote of the function f(x) = (2x)/(x² -5x -14). Then add the vertical asymptote x-values (a and b) and the horizontal asymptote y-value (c) together to get a+b+c. Hmm, let's start with the vertical asymptotes.

Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, right? Because that's where the function is undefined. So first, I need to factor the denominator to find those x-values.

<prompt_1.1> Factor the denominator of the function f(x) to find the x-values where it is zero, which correspond to the vertical asymptotes. </prompt_1.1>

<execution_1.1>
The denominator is x² -5x -14. Let me try factoring that. I need two numbers that multiply to -14 and add to -5. Let's see... factors of -14 could be  -7 and 2. Because -7 * 2 = -14, and -7 + 2 = -5. Yeah, that works. So the denominator factors as (x - 7)(x + 2). So the vertical asymptotes are at x = 7 and x = -2. Therefore, a and b are 7 and -2. But wait, the problem says vertical asymptotes x=a and x=b. It doesn't specify the order, but since they are asking for a + b, the order might not matter because addition is commutative.

Based on execution_1.1:
Next, horizontal asymptote. The horizontal asymptote of a rational function depends on the degrees of the numerator and denominator. The numerator here is 2x, which is degree 1. The denominator is x² -5x -14, which is degree 2. Since the degree of the denominator is higher than the degree of the numerator, the horizontal asymptote is y = 0.

<prompt_2.1> Determine the horizontal asymptote of the function f(x) based on the degrees of the numerator and denominator. </prompt_2.1>

So adding them up: a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0. Let me compute that.
7 - 2 is 5, plus 0 is 5. So the answer should be 5.

Wait, let me double-check.

<prompt_2.2> Verify the calculations for the vertical and horizontal asymptotes to ensure the sum a + b + c is correct. </prompt_2.2>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
So c is 0.

Therefore, a is 7, b is -2, c is 0. So a + b + c is 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Denominator factoring: x² -5x -14. Let me expand (x -7)(x +2): x² +2x -7x -14 = x² -5x -14. Correct. So vertical asymptotes at 7 and -2. Horizontal asymptote: degree of numerator (1) < degree of denominator (2), so y=0. So 7 + (-2) +0 =5.
</execution_2.2>
</Execution_2>

<Final_answer>
Therefore, the sum of $a$, $b$, and $c$ is $7 + (-2) + 0 = \boxed{5}$.
