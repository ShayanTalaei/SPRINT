Okay, so I have this equation: \(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\). It's a degree 10 polynomial, so there are 10 roots, which are given as \(r_1, \overline{r}_1, r_2, \overline{r}_2, \ldots, r_5, \overline{r}_5\). The problem is asking for the sum of the reciprocals of the products of each pair of complex conjugates. That is, I need to compute \(\frac{1}{r_1 \overline{r}_1} + \frac{1}{r_2 \overline{r}_2} + \ldots + \frac{1}{r_5 \overline{r}_5}\).

First, I remember that for a complex number \(r\), the product \(r \overline{r}\) is equal to the square of its modulus, \(|r|^2\). So, each term \(\frac{1}{r_i \overline{r}_i}\) is actually \(\frac{1}{|r_i|^2}\). Therefore, the sum we need is the sum of the reciprocals of the squared moduli of each pair of roots.

But how do I find this sum? Hmm. Let's think about the properties of polynomials and their roots. If I can find a polynomial whose roots are \(\frac{1}{r_i \overline{r}_i}\), then the sum of the roots of that polynomial would be the answer. But constructing such a polynomial might be complicated.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to relate this sum to the coefficients of the original polynomial. Let me recall Vieta's formulas. For a polynomial of the form \(a_{10}x^{10} + a_9x^9 + \ldots + a_0 = 0\), the sum of the reciprocals of the roots is \(-\frac{a_1}{a_0}\) if all roots are non-zero.

But in our case, the roots come in conjugate pairs, and we are taking reciprocals of their products. Wait, perhaps there's a better approach.

Let me first try to understand the original equation better. The equation is \(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\). Let's write this as \(x^{10} = - (13x - 1)^{10}\).

<prompt_1.1> Simplify the equation \(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\) to find a condition for the roots. </prompt_1.1>
-----

Alternatively, perhaps there's a substitution that can be done here. Let me think. Let me set \(y = 13x - 1\), then \(x = \frac{y + 1}{13}\). Substitute into the equation:

<prompt_1.2> Explore a substitution \(y = 13x - 1\) to simplify the equation and find the sum of reciprocals. </prompt_1.2>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
Taking the 10th root of both sides, we get \(x = \omega (13x - 1)\), where \(\omega\) is a 10th root of \(-1\). Since \(-1 = e^{i\pi + 2\pi i k}\) for any integer \(k\), the 10th roots of \(-1\) are \(e^{i\pi(1 + 2k)/10}\) for \(k = 0, 1, \ldots, 9\). So, each root \(x\) corresponds to a choice of \(\omega\) such that \(x = \omega (13x - 1)\).

Let's solve for \(x\):

\(x = \omega (13x - 1)\)

\(x = 13 \omega x - \omega\)

Bring terms with \(x\) to one side:

\(x - 13 \omega x = -\omega\)

\(x(1 - 13 \omega) = -\omega\)

Therefore,

\(x = \frac{-\omega}{1 - 13 \omega}\)
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
\[
\left( \frac{y + 1}{13} \right)^{10} + y^{10} = 0
\]
Multiply both sides by \(13^{10}\):
\[
(y + 1)^{10} + 13^{10} y^{10} = 0
\]
Hmm, not sure if this helps. Maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps considering the original equation \(x^{10} = - (13x - 1)^{10}\), taking the 10th root on both sides, we get \(x = \omega (13x - 1)\), where \(\omega\) is a 10th root of -1. But since \(-1 = e^{i\pi + 2k\pi i}\), so the 10th roots would be \(e^{i(\pi + 2k\pi)/10}\) for \(k = 0, 1, \ldots, 9\). Therefore, each root \(x\) satisfies \(x = \omega (13x - 1)\), which can be rearranged as \(x = 13 \omega x - \omega\), so \(x - 13 \omega x = -\omega\), so \(x(1 - 13 \omega) = -\omega\), hence \(x = \frac{-\omega}{1 - 13 \omega}\).

Therefore, all roots can be expressed as \(x = \frac{-\omega}{1 - 13 \omega}\), where \(\omega^{10} = -1\). So, \(\omega\) are the 20th roots of unity that are odd multiples of \(e^{i\pi/10}\), right? Because the 10th roots of -1 are the same as the 20th roots of unity that are not 10th roots of unity. Wait, maybe not. Let me think.

The equation \(\omega^{10} = -1\) can be written as \(\omega^{10} = e^{i\pi + 2k\pi i}\), so \(\omega = e^{i(\pi + 2k\pi)/10}\) for \(k = 0, 1, \ldots, 9\). These are 10 distinct roots spaced at intervals of \(2\pi/10\) starting from \(\pi/10\). So they are not the primitive 20th roots of unity, but rather, they are the 10th roots of -1. So each \(\omega\) is a primitive 20th root of unity? Wait, no. For example, when \(k = 5\), \(\omega = e^{i(6\pi)/10} = e^{i3\pi/5}\), which is not a 20th root of unity, but a 10th root. Wait, perhaps they are 20th roots of unity. Let me check.

Suppose \(\omega\) is a 20th root of unity, so \(\omega^{20} = 1\). Then \(\omega^{10} = \pm 1\). So if \(\omega^{10} = -1\), then \(\omega\) must be a primitive 20th root of unity. Therefore, the solutions \(\omega\) are the primitive 20th roots of unity. There are 10 of them, which matches the degree of the equation. Therefore, the roots of the equation \(x^{10} + (13x -1)^{10} = 0\) are given by \(x = \frac{-\omega}{1 - 13 \omega}\) where \(\omega\) are the primitive 20th roots of unity.

Therefore, each root \(r_j\) is of the form \(\frac{-\omega}{1 - 13 \omega}\), and \(\overline{r_j}\) would be the conjugate of that, which is \(\frac{-\overline{\omega}}{1 - 13 \overline{\omega}}\), since conjugation commutes with addition and multiplication.

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Let's denote \(\omega = e^{i\pi(1 + 2k)/10}\) for \(k = 0, 1, \ldots, 9\). Then, each root is given by that expression.

But maybe instead of dealing with all 10 roots, there's a symmetry or a way to pair them up. Since the coefficients of the polynomial are real, complex roots come in conjugate pairs. So, for each \(r_j\), there is a \(\overline{r_j}\).

<prompt_2.1> Analyze the expression \(x = \frac{-\omega}{1 - 13 \omega}\) for symmetry and determine if \(x\) is real. </prompt_2.1>
-----

Based on execution_1.2:
But perhaps we can compute \(\frac{1}{r_j \overline{r_j}}\) in terms of \(\omega\). Let's compute \(r_j \overline{r_j}\):

\(r_j \overline{r_j} = \left| \frac{-\omega}{1 - 13 \omega} \right|^2 = \frac{|\omega|^2}{|1 - 13 \omega|^2}\).

<prompt_2.2> Compute the product \(r_j \overline{r_j}\) using the expression for \(r_j\) in terms of \(\omega\). </prompt_2.2>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
So, for each pair \(r_j, \overline{r_j}\), their product is \(|r_j|^2\), which is a positive real number. Therefore, the reciprocal \(1/(r_j \overline{r_j})\) is \(1/|r_j|^2\), which is also a positive real number. Therefore, the sum we need is a sum of real numbers, which is good.

But how to compute this sum? Let's think about the original equation. Maybe we can manipulate the equation to get an expression involving \(1/x\) or something else that relates to the reciprocals.

Alternatively, perhaps consider substituting \(y = 1/x\). Let's try that. If \(x \neq 0\), then substituting \(y = 1/x\) into the equation:

\((1/y)^{10} + (13*(1/y) - 1)^{10} = 0\)

Multiply both sides by \(y^{10}\):

\(1 + (13 - y)^{10} = 0\)

Wait, let's check that step again. Let me compute each term:

First term: \((1/y)^{10} = 1/y^{10}\)

Second term: \((13*(1/y) - 1)^{10} = (13/y - 1)^{10}\)

So the equation becomes:

\(1/y^{10} + (13/y - 1)^{10} = 0\)

Multiply both sides by \(y^{10}\):

\(1 + (13 - y)^{10} = 0\)

Wait, that seems incorrect. Let me compute the second term after multiplying by \(y^{10}\):

The second term is \((13/y - 1)^{10} \times y^{10} = (13 - y)^{10}\). So, multiplying the entire equation by \(y^{10}\) gives:

\(1 + (13 - y)^{10} = 0\)

Therefore, \((y - 13)^{10} = -1\). So, \(y - 13\) is a 10th root of \(-1\). Therefore, \(y = 13 + \omega\), where \(\omega^{10} = -1\).
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Since \(\omega\) is a 20th root of unity, \(|\omega| = 1\), so \(|\omega|^2 = 1\). Therefore,

\(r_j \overline{r_j} = \frac{1}{|1 - 13 \omega|^2}\).

Therefore, \(\frac{1}{r_j \overline{r_j}} = |1 - 13 \omega|^2\). So, the sum we need is \(\sum_{j=1}^5 |1 - 13 \omega_j|^2\), where \(\omega_j\) are the 10 primitive 20th roots of unity (since each pair \(r_j, \overline{r_j}\) corresponds to a pair of \(\omega\) and \(\overline{\omega}\), but since \(\omega\) are 20th roots, their conjugates are also 20th roots. Wait, but we have 10 roots \(\omega\), each corresponding to a unique conjugate pair. Wait, maybe not. Let's see.

Wait, the original equation is of degree 10, and we have 10 roots \(\omega\) such that \(\omega^{10} = -1\). Each \(\omega\) gives a root \(x = \frac{-\omega}{1 - 13 \omega}\). Since the polynomial has real coefficients, the roots must come in complex conjugate pairs. Therefore, if \(\omega\) is a root, then \(\overline{\omega}\) must also be a root. But \(\omega^{10} = -1\), so \(\overline{\omega}^{10} = \overline{-1} = -1\). Therefore, the roots \(\omega\) come in conjugate pairs. Therefore, there are 5 conjugate pairs of \(\omega\), each pair giving two roots \(r_j\) and \(\overline{r_j}\) of the original equation. Therefore, the sum we need is the sum over 5 pairs of \(\frac{1}{r_j \overline{r_j}}\), which is equivalent to summing \(\frac{1}{|r_j|^2}\) for each pair. But since \(r_j\) is given by \(x = \frac{-\omega}{1 - 13 \omega}\), and \(\omega\) and \(\overline{\omega}\) form a conjugate pair, then each pair contributes \(|1 - 13 \omega|^2 + |1 - 13 \overline{\omega}|^2\), but since \(|1 - 13 \omega|^2 = |1 - 13 \overline{\omega}|^2\), each pair contributes twice the same value. Wait, but in the original problem, the sum is over 5 terms, each corresponding to a pair \(r_j, \overline{r_j}\). Therefore, each term is \(\frac{1}{r_j \overline{r_j}} = |1 - 13 \omega_j|^2\), where \(\omega_j\) are the 5 distinct conjugate pairs. Wait, but there are 10 roots \(\omega\), each corresponding to a unique \(\omega\) in the expression \(x = \frac{-\omega}{1 - 13 \omega}\). But since \(\omega\) and \(\overline{\omega}\) give conjugate roots \(r_j\) and \(\overline{r_j}\), then each conjugate pair \(r_j, \overline{r_j}\) corresponds to a pair \(\omega, \overline{\omega}\). Therefore, the sum \(\sum_{j=1}^5 \frac{1}{r_j \overline{r_j}} = \sum_{j=1}^5 |1 - 13 \omega_j|^2\), where \(\omega_j\) are the 5 distinct \(\omega\) in the upper half-plane (assuming \(\omega\) is not real). Wait, but \(\omega\) are 20th roots of unity with \(\omega^{10} = -1\), so \(\omega\) are on the unit circle at angles \(\pi/10 + 2k\pi/10\), so their angles are \(\pi/10, 3\pi/10, 5\pi/10, \ldots, 19\pi/10\). But since \(\omega\) and \(\overline{\omega}\) are conjugates, each pair contributes the same modulus squared. Therefore, the sum over all 10 roots \(\omega\) would be twice the sum over 5 roots in the upper half-plane. But in our problem, we have 5 pairs \(r_j, \overline{r_j}\), each contributing \(|1 - 13 \omega_j|^2\), so the total sum is the sum over 5 terms of \(|1 - 13 \omega_j|^2\), where \(\omega_j\) are the 5 distinct \(\omega\) in the upper half-plane.

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.2:
Alternatively, perhaps note that \(\omega\) are the 20th roots of unity such that \(\omega^{10} = -1\), so they are the 20th roots of unity with odd orders? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe consider that since \(\omega^{10} = -1\), then \(\omega\) are the 20th roots of unity that are not 10th roots of unity. Wait, the 10th roots of unity satisfy \(\omega^{10} = 1\), so if \(\omega^{10} = -1\), then \(\omega\) are 20th roots of unity, since \(\omega^{20} = (\omega^{10})^2 = (-1)^2 = 1\). Therefore, \(\omega\) are primitive 20th roots of unity. There are 10 of them, which matches the degree of the equation.

Based on execution_2.1:
Let's expand this. Let me write \(y = 13 + \omega\), where \(\omega^{10} = -1\). Then, substituting back, we have \(y = 13 + \omega\), so \(\omega = y - 13\). Then, \(\omega^{10} = -1\) implies \((y - 13)^{10} = -1\).

<prompt_3.1> Expand the equation \((y - 13)^{10} = -1\) and relate it to the original equation. </prompt_3.1>
-----

Based on execution_2.2, execution_2.1:
But maybe we can relate this to the original equation. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps instead of substituting \(y = 1/x\), consider taking reciprocals in the original equation. Let me see.

<prompt_3.2> Attempt to substitute \(y = 1/x\) into the original equation and simplify. </prompt_3.2>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
So, the equation becomes \((y - 13)^{10} = -1\), which can be rewritten as \((y - 13)^{10} + 1 = 0\). Therefore, the roots \(y\) satisfy this equation. Therefore, the roots of this equation are \(y = 13 + \omega\), where \(\omega\) are the 10th roots of \(-1\). So, the roots \(y\) are \(13 + \omega\), with \(\omega^{10} = -1\).

But originally, we had \(y = 1/x\), so \(x = 1/y\). Therefore, the roots of the original equation are \(x = 1/(13 + \omega)\), where \(\omega^{10} = -1\).
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
The original equation is \(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\). If we take reciprocal of both sides, we get \(1/x^{10} + (13/x - 1/x)^{10} = 0\). But this seems more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps divide both sides by \(x^{10}\):

\(1 + \left( \frac{13x - 1}{x} \right)^{10} = 0\)

Simplify the second term:

\(\left(13 - \frac{1}{x}\right)^{10} = -1\)

So, \(13 - \frac{1}{x}\) is a 10th root of \(-1\), which is similar to the previous substitution. Let me set \(z = \frac{1}{x}\), then the equation becomes:

\(13 - z = \omega\), where \(\omega^{10} = -1\)

Therefore, \(z = 13 - \omega\), so \(x = \frac{1}{13 - \omega}\), where \(\omega^{10} = -1\). Therefore, the roots are \(x = \frac{1}{13 - \omega}\), with \(\omega^{10} = -1\). Interesting. So, this substitution gives us a different expression for the roots. Comparing this with the previous substitution where we had \(x = \frac{-\omega}{1 - 13 \omega}\), they might be equivalent under some transformation.

Based on execution_3.2:
Alternatively, perhaps we can use this expression \(x = \frac{1}{13 - \omega}\) to find the roots. Let me check for a specific \(\omega\).

-----

Based on execution_3.2:
Let me see if these two expressions for \(x\) are equivalent. Suppose \(x = \frac{1}{13 - \omega}\), and in the previous substitution, \(x = \frac{-\omega'}{1 - 13 \omega'}\). Let me see if there's a relation between \(\omega\) and \(\omega'\).

<prompt_4.3> Compare the expressions for \(x\) from both substitutions and identify any relation between \(\omega\) and \(\omega'\). </prompt_4.3>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
Suppose \(\omega = 1\), but \(\omega^{10} = 1 \neq -1\), so that's not allowed. Let's take \(\omega\) such that \(\omega^{10} = -1\). For example, take \(\omega = e^{i\pi(1 + 2k)/10}\) as before. Then, \(x = \frac{1}{13 - \omega}\). Comparing this to the previous expression \(x = \frac{-\omega}{1 - 13 \omega}\), they are different. So perhaps there was a mistake in the substitution process earlier?

Wait, let's go back. Original equation: \(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\). Let me set \(y = 1/x\), so \(x = 1/y\). Substitute into the equation:

\((1/y)^{10} + (13*(1/y) - 1)^{10} = 0\)

Multiply both sides by \(y^{10}\):

\(1 + (13 - y)^{10} = 0\)

Wait, that's not correct. Wait, the second term is \((13*(1/y) - 1)^{10}\), which is \((13/y - 1)^{10}\). Then, multiplying by \(y^{10}\) gives \((13 - y)^{10}\). Therefore, the equation becomes \(1 + (13 - y)^{10} = 0\), so \((y - 13)^{10} = -1\). Therefore, \(y = 13 + \omega\), where \(\omega^{10} = -1\). Therefore, \(x = 1/y = 1/(13 + \omega)\). So this substitution gives \(x = 1/(13 + \omega)\), where \(\omega^{10} = -1\).
</execution_4.1>

<execution_4.2>
Then, substituting \(y = 1/x\), we get \(1/y^2 + (1/y - 1)^2 = 0\). Multiply by \(y^2\): \(1 + (1 - y)^2 = 0\), so \(1 + (1 - 2y + y^2) = 0\), which simplifies to \(y^2 - 2y + 2 = 0\). The roots of this equation are \(y = 1 \pm i\), so \(x = 1/(1 \pm i) = (1 \mp i)/2\). The original equation \(x^2 + (x - 1)^2 = 0\) can be expanded as \(x^2 + x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0\), which simplifies to \(2x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0\), with roots \((1 \pm i)/2\), which matches the substitution result.
</execution_4.2>

<execution_4.3>
Let me set \(\frac{1}{13 - \omega} = \frac{-\omega'}{1 - 13 \omega'}\). Cross-multiplying:

\(1 - 13 \omega' = -\omega'(13 - \omega)\)

\(1 - 13 \omega' = -13 \omega' + \omega' \omega\)

Simplify:

\(1 = \omega' \omega\)

So, \(\omega \omega' = 1\). Therefore, \(\omega' = \omega^{-1}\). But since \(\omega^{10} = -1\), then \(\omega' = \omega^{-1}\) would satisfy \((\omega')^{10} = (\omega^{-1})^{10} = (\omega^{10})^{-1} = (-1)^{-1} = -1\). Therefore, \(\omega'\) is also a 10th root of \(-1\). Therefore, the two expressions are equivalent, with \(\omega' = \omega^{-1}\). Therefore, both substitutions are valid, and the roots can be expressed in either form. So, perhaps using \(x = \frac{1}{13 - \omega}\) is simpler.
</execution_4.3>
</Execution_4>

<Plan_5>
Based on execution_4.3:
But let's check if this is correct. For example, take \(\omega = e^{i\pi(1 + 2k)/10}\), then \(\omega' = \omega^{-1} = e^{-i\pi(1 + 2k)/10}\). Then, \(x = \frac{-\omega}{1 - 13 \omega} = \frac{-\omega}{1 - 13 \omega}\), and \(x = \frac{1}{13 - \omega'} = \frac{1}{13 - \omega^{-1}}\). Let's see if these are equal.

<prompt_5.1> Verify the equivalence of the expressions \(x = \frac{-\omega}{1 - 13 \omega}\) and \(x = \frac{1}{13 - \omega'}\) where \(\omega' = \omega^{-1}\). </prompt_5.1>

Based on execution_4.1:
Therefore, the roots of the original equation are \(x = \frac{1}{13 + \omega}\), where \(\omega^{10} = -1\). Therefore, these are the 10 roots. Since the polynomial has real coefficients, complex roots come in conjugate pairs. Therefore, if \(\omega\) is a non-real root, then its complex conjugate \(\overline{\omega}\) is also a root. Therefore, the roots \(x\) and \(\overline{x}\) correspond to \(\omega\) and \(\overline{\omega}\). Therefore, the 10 roots can be grouped into 5 conjugate pairs. Therefore, the sum we need is \(\sum_{j=1}^5 \frac{1}{x_j \overline{x_j}} = \sum_{j=1}^5 \frac{1}{|x_j|^2}\).

<execution_5.1>
Cross-multiplying:

\(-\omega (13 - \omega') = 1 - 13 \omega'\)

\(-13 \omega + \omega \omega' = 1 - 13 \omega'\)

But since \(\omega \omega' = 1\), this becomes:

\(-13 \omega + 1 = 1 - 13 \omega'\)

Then, subtract 1 from both sides:

\(-13 \omega = -13 \omega'\)

Divide by -13:

\(\omega = \omega'\)

But \(\omega' = \omega^{-1}\), so \(\omega = \omega^{-1}\), which implies \(\omega^2 = 1\), so \(\omega = \pm 1\). However, \(\omega^{10} = -1\), so \(\omega = 1\) or \(-1\) would imply \(1 = -1\) or \((-1)^{10} = 1 = -1\), which is false. Therefore, this suggests a contradiction, meaning that the two expressions for \(x\) are not equivalent in general. Therefore, perhaps there was a mistake in the substitution steps? Wait, but both substitutions started from the original equation. Let me check again.

Original equation: \(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\). Let me substitute \(y = 1/x\). Then, \(x = 1/y\). Substituting into the equation:

\((1/y)^{10} + (13*(1/y) - 1)^{10} = 0\)

Multiply both sides by \(y^{10}\):

\(1 + (13 - y)^{10} = 0\)

Wait, that's correct. So, \((13 - y)^{10} = -1\), so \(y = 13 + \omega\), \(\omega^{10} = -1\). Therefore, \(x = 1/y = 1/(13 + \omega)\). Therefore, this seems correct. Then, the other substitution approach gave a different expression. Hmm. Therefore, perhaps the original equation after substitution gives \(y = 13 + \omega\), so \(x = 1/(13 + \omega)\), which is different from the previous substitution which gave \(x = -\omega/(1 - 13 \omega)\). Therefore, these two expressions must be related but different representations of the same roots. Therefore, perhaps there is a relation between \(\omega\) and \(\omega'\) such that \(1/(13 + \omega) = -\omega'/(1 - 13 \omega')\). Let me check.

Set \(1/(13 + \omega) = -\omega'/(1 - 13 \omega')\). Cross-multiplying:

\(1 - 13 \omega' = -\omega'(13 + \omega)\)

\(1 - 13 \omega' = -13 \omega' - \omega \omega'\)

Bring all terms to left-hand side:

\(1 - 13 \omega' + 13 \omega' + \omega \omega' = 0\)

Simplify:

\(1 + \omega \omega' = 0\)

Therefore, \(\omega \omega' = -1\). Therefore, \(\omega' = -\omega^{-1}\). Therefore, substituting back, \(\omega' = -\omega^{-1}\). Therefore, given \(\omega^{10} = -1\), then \(\omega' = -\omega^{-1}\) would satisfy \((\omega')^{10} = (-\omega^{-1})^{10} = (-1)^{10} (\omega^{-1})^{10} = 1 \cdot (\omega^{10})^{-1} = 1 \cdot (-1)^{-1} = -1\). Therefore, \(\omega'\) is also a 10th root of \(-1\). Therefore, the two expressions are related by \(\omega' = -\omega^{-1}\). Therefore, the two expressions for \(x\) are equivalent under this relation.

<execution_5.2>
Since \(x_j \overline{x_j} = |x_j|^2\), each term is \(1/|x_j|^2\). But since \(x_j = 1/(13 + \omega_j)\), where \(\omega_j^{10} = -1\), then \(|x_j|^2 = 1/|13 + \omega_j|^2\). Therefore, \(1/|x_j|^2 = |13 + \omega_j|^2\). Therefore, the sum we need is \(\sum_{j=1}^5 |13 + \omega_j|^2\), where \(\omega_j\) are the 10 roots \(\omega\) of \(\omega^{10} = -1\), grouped into conjugate pairs.

<execution_5.3>
The original equation is \(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\). Let's write this as \(x^{10} = - (13x - 1)^{10}\). Taking the 10th root, we get \(x = \omega (13x - 1)\), where \(\omega^{10} = -1\). Then, solving for \(x\) gives \(x = \frac{-\omega}{1 - 13 \omega}\), as before. Alternatively, using the substitution \(y = 1/x\), we found \(x = \frac{1}{13 + \omega}\). So, perhaps both expressions are equivalent? Let me check with a specific \(\omega\).

Suppose \(\omega = e^{i\pi/10}\), which is a 10th root of \(-1\). Then, \(x = \frac{-\omega}{1 - 13 \omega}\). Let's compute this. Alternatively, using the substitution \(y = 1/x\), we have \(x = \frac{1}{13 + \omega}\). Let's compute both expressions for a specific \(\omega\). Let me choose \(\omega = e^{i\pi/10}\). Then:

First expression: \(x = \frac{-e^{i\pi/10}}{1 - 13 e^{i\pi/10}}\)

Second expression: \(x = \frac{1}{13 + e^{i\pi/10}}\)

Are these equal?

Let me check:

Multiply numerator and denominator of the first expression by \(1 + 13 e^{-i\pi/10}\):

Wait, perhaps cross-multiplied:

If \(\frac{-\omega}{1 - 13 \omega} = \frac{1}{13 + \omega}\), then:

\(-\omega (13 + \omega) = 1 - 13 \omega\)

Left side: \(-13 \omega - \omega^2\)

Right side: \(1 - 13 \omega\)

Therefore, equate:

\(-13 \omega - \omega^2 = 1 - 13 \omega\)

Simplify: Subtract right side from left side:

\(-13 \omega - \omega^2 - 1 + 13 \omega = 0\)

Which simplifies to:

\(-\omega^2 - 1 = 0 \implies \omega^2 = -1\)

But \(\omega^{10} = -1\), so \(\omega^2 = -1\) would imply \(\omega^4 = 1\), but \(\omega^{10} = -1\). Let's check if \(\omega^2 = -1\):

If \(\omega^2 = -1\), then \(\omega^4 = 1\), so \(\omega\) is a 4th root of unity. However, our \(\omega\) satisfies \(\omega^{10} = -1\). Let's see:

If \(\omega^2 = -1\), then \(\omega^{10} = (\omega^2)^5 = (-1)^5 = -1\), which is consistent. Therefore, in this case, \(\omega^2 = -1\), so \(\omega\) is a primitive 4th root of unity. But a primitive 4th root of unity satisfies \(\omega^4 = 1\), so \(\omega^2 = -1\). Therefore, such \(\omega\) would satisfy both \(\omega^{10} = -1\) and \(\omega^2 = -1\). Therefore, in this case, the two expressions for \(x\) would be equal. Therefore, perhaps these two expressions are equivalent when \(\omega^2 = -1\). But in general, unless \(\omega\) satisfies \(\omega^2 = -1\), the two expressions are different. Therefore, perhaps the substitution via \(y = 1/x\) gives a different parametrization, but the roots are the same. Therefore, maybe there's a bijection between the two parametrizations. However, this might complicate things. Perhaps sticking to one substitution is better.

<Plan_6>
Based on execution_5.3:
Let me try to compute this sum. The roots are \(x = \frac{1}{13 + \omega}\), where \(\omega^{10} = -1\). Therefore, \(\omega = e^{i\pi(1 + 2k)/10}\) for \(k = 0, 1, \ldots, 9\). Therefore, \(13 + \omega = 13 + e^{i\pi(1 + 2k)/10}\). Then, \(|13 + \omega|^2 = |13 + e^{i\theta}|^2\), where \(\theta = \pi(1 + 2k)/10\). Let's compute this.

The modulus squared of a complex number \(a + b\) is \(|a + b|^2 = a^2 + 2ab \cos \theta + b^2\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are real numbers and \(\theta\) is the argument. Wait, but in this case, \(13 + e^{i\theta}\) can be written as \(13 + \cos\theta + i \sin\theta\). Therefore, the modulus squared is \((13 + \cos\theta)^2 + (\sin\theta)^2\).

<prompt_6.1> Compute the modulus squared of \(13 + e^{i\theta}\) and simplify the expression. </prompt_6.1>
</Plan_6>

<Execution_6>
<execution_6.1>
Let's compute this:

\((13 + \cos\theta)^2 + (\sin\theta)^2 = 13^2 + 26 \cos\theta + \cos^2\theta + \sin^2\theta = 169 + 26 \cos\theta + 1 = 170 + 26 \cos\theta\).

Therefore, \(|13 + \omega|^2 = 170 + 26 \cos\theta\), where \(\theta = \pi(1 + 2k)/10\) for each root \(\omega = e^{i\theta}\).

Therefore, the sum we need is the sum over \(k = 0\) to \(9\) of \(170 + 26 \cos\theta_k\), where \(\theta_k = \pi(1 + 2k)/10\). However, since the roots come in conjugate pairs, each pair will contribute twice the real part of one term. Wait, but actually, since we have 10 roots, each corresponding to a different \(k\), but when we take the sum over all \(k\), we can compute it directly.

But wait, no. Wait, the original equation has 10 roots, each corresponding to a distinct \(\omega\), but when we group them into conjugate pairs, each pair contributes one term to the sum. However, since the expression \(|13 + \omega|^2\) is the same for \(\omega\) and \(\overline{\omega}\), because cosine is even. Therefore, each conjugate pair contributes twice the real part of one term. But since we have 10 roots, each \(\theta_k\) is distinct, but when considering the sum over all \(k\), we can compute it as the sum over \(k = 0\) to \(9\) of \(170 + 26 \cos\theta_k\). However, since the roots are complex conjugates, the sum over all 10 roots would be twice the sum over 5 roots (the upper ones), but since we need to sum over all 10 roots, but the original problem requires summing over 5 pairs. Wait, no. Wait, the problem states that the roots are \(r_1, \overline{r}_1, \ldots, r_5, \overline{r}_5\). Therefore, each pair corresponds to two roots \(r_j\) and \(\overline{r_j}\), each corresponding to a different \(\omega\). Therefore, each pair corresponds to two different \(\omega\)s, which are complex conjugates. Therefore, their contributions to the sum would be \(|13 + \omega|^2 + |13 + \overline{\omega}|^2\). But since \(|13 + \omega|^2 = |13 + \overline{\omega}|^2\), because taking the conjugate of \(13 + \omega\) gives \(13 + \overline{\omega}\), and the modulus squared is the same. Therefore, each pair contributes \(2 \times \text{Re}(|13 + \omega|^2)\). Wait, but actually, since \(\omega\) and \(\overline{\omega}\) are distinct roots, their contributions are both \(|13 + \omega|^2\) and \(|13 + \overline{\omega}|^2\), which are equal. Therefore, each pair contributes \(2 \times |13 + \omega|^2\), where \(\omega\) is one of the 10 roots. But since the original equation has 10 roots, each pair contributes twice.

</Execution_6>

<Plan_7>
Based on execution_6.1:
Therefore, the total sum over all 10 roots would be \(\sum_{k=0}^9 |13 + \omega_k|^2 = \sum_{k=0}^9 (170 + 26 \cos\theta_k)\), where \(\theta_k = \pi(1 + 2k)/10\). But since the roots come in conjugate pairs, each pair contributes twice the real part. Therefore, the sum over all 10 roots is \(10 \times 170 + 26 \times \sum_{k=0}^9 \cos\theta_k\). Wait, no. Wait, each pair contributes twice the real part. Let me think again.

<prompt_7.1> Calculate the sum of the modulus squared of \(13 + \omega\) for all 10 roots and simplify the expression. </prompt_7.1>
</Plan_7>

<Execution_7>
<execution_7.1>
If we have 5 pairs, each pair contributing \(2 \times \text{Re}(|13 + \omega|^2)\), but actually, since each pair is two distinct roots, each contributing the same modulus squared, the sum over all 10 roots would be \(10 \times 170 + 26 \times \sum_{k=0}^9 \cos\theta_k\). But that seems incorrect because each term is already accounted for in the sum. Wait, no. Wait, the sum over all 10 roots is \(\sum_{k=0}^9 (170 + 26 \cos\theta_k)\). Since each \(\theta_k = \pi(1 + 2k)/10\). However, since the roots come in conjugate pairs, for each \(k\), there exists a \(k'\) such that \(\theta_{k'} = -\theta_k\). Therefore, \(\cos\theta_{k'} = \cos(-\theta_k) = \cos\theta_k\). Therefore, the sum over all 10 roots would be \(10 \times 170 + 26 \times \sum_{k=0}^9 \cos\theta_k\). But since each pair contributes twice the same cosine term, the sum over 10 roots is actually \(10 \times 170 + 26 \times 2 \times \sum_{k=0}^4 \cos\theta_k\), where \(\theta_k\) are the angles for the upper half. Wait, but actually, the angles \(\theta_k = \pi(1 + 2k)/10\) for \(k = 0\) to \(9\) would cover all 10 roots. However, since \(\cos\theta\) is even, \(\cos\theta_{10 - k} = \cos(-\theta_k) = \cos\theta_k\). Therefore, the sum \(\sum_{k=0}^9 \cos\theta_k = 2 \sum_{k=0}^4 \cos\theta_k\). Therefore, the total sum is \(10 \times 170 + 26 \times 2 \times \sum_{k=0}^4 \cos\theta_k\). But this seems complicated. Alternatively, since each pair contributes twice the same cosine term, maybe there's a symmetry here. However, perhaps it's easier to compute the sum over all 10 roots directly.

But wait, the problem asks for the sum over 5 pairs, each pair contributing \(|13 + \omega|^2\) once. Wait, no. Wait, the problem states that the sum is \(\frac{1}{r_1 \overline{r}_1} + \ldots + \frac{1}{r_5 \overline{r}_5}\). Since each \(r_j\) and \(\overline{r}_j\) correspond to two different roots, say \(\omega_j\) and \(\overline{\omega_j}\), then each pair contributes \(\frac{1}{|x_j|^2} + \frac{1}{|\overline{x_j}|^2} = 2 \times \frac{1}{|x_j|^2}\). Wait, but \(\frac{1}{x_j \overline{x_j}} = \frac{1}{|x_j|^2}\), so each pair contributes \(2 \times \frac{1}{|x_j|^2}\). However, according to the problem statement, the sum is over 5 terms, each being \(\frac{1}{r_j \overline{r_j}}\), which would be \(2 \times \frac{1}{|x_j|^2}\). Wait, no. Wait, if the roots are \(r_j\) and \(\overline{r_j}\), then each pair contributes two terms: \(\frac{1}{r_j \overline{r_j}}\) and \(\frac{1}{\overline{r_j} r_j}\), but since \(r_j \overline{r_j} = \overline{r_j} r_j = |r_j|^2\), both terms are the same. Therefore, each pair contributes \(2 \times \frac{1}{|r_j|^2}\). Therefore, the total sum is \(2 \sum_{j=1}^5 \frac{1}{|r_j|^2}\). But according to the problem statement, the sum is written as \(\frac{1}{r_1 \overline{r_1}} + \ldots + \frac{1}{r_5 \overline{r_5}}\), which would be \(5\) terms, each being \(\frac{1}{|r_j|^2}\), but since each \(r_j\) and \(\overline{r_j}\) are separate roots, the sum is actually \(5\) terms. Wait, no. Wait, the roots are \(r_1, \overline{r_1}, \ldots, r_5, \overline{r_5}\), so the sum is \(\sum_{j=1}^5 \left( \frac{1}{r_j \overline{r_j}} + \frac{1}{\overline{r_j} r_j} \right ) = \sum_{j=1}^5 2 \frac{1}{|r_j|^2}\). Therefore, the total sum is \(2 \sum_{j=1}^5 \frac{1}{|r_j|^2}\).

<Plan_8>
Based on execution_7.1:
Therefore, we need to compute \(2 \sum_{j=1}^5 \frac{1}{|r_j|^2} = 2 \sum_{j=1}^5 |13 + \omega_j|^2\), where \(\omega_j\) are the 5 distinct roots in the upper half-plane (i.e., \(\omega_j^{10} = -1\), \(\text{Im}(\omega_j) > 0\)). Wait, no. Wait, the sum over all 10 roots would be \(\sum_{k=0}^9 |13 + \omega_k|^2\), but since each pair contributes twice, the total sum is \(2 \sum_{j=1}^5 |13 + \omega_j|^2\), where \(\omega_j\) are the roots with positive imaginary parts. Therefore, the desired sum is \(2 \sum_{j=1}^5 |13 + \omega_j|^2\). Therefore, we need to compute \(2 \sum_{j=1}^5 |13 + \omega_j|^2 = \sum_{k=0}^9 |13 + \omega_k|^2\).

<prompt_8.1> Use the cosine summation formula to simplify the expression for the sum of the modulus squared. </prompt_8.1>
</Plan_8>

<Execution_8>
<execution_8.1>
But since \(\omega_k = e^{i\theta_k}\) where \(\theta_k = \pi(1 + 2k)/10\), then \(|13 + \omega_k|^2 = 170 + 26 \cos\theta_k\). Therefore, the total sum is \(\sum_{k=0}^9 (170 + 26 \cos\theta_k) = 10 \times 170 + 26 \sum_{k=0}^9 \cos\theta_k = 1700 + 26 \sum_{k=0}^9 \cos\left( \frac{\pi(1 + 2k)}{10} \right )\).

Now, we need to compute the sum \(S = \sum_{k=0}^9 \cos\left( \frac{\pi(1 + 2k)}{10} \right )\). Let's compute this sum.

<Plan_9>
Based on execution_8.1:
First, note that the angles are \(\theta_k = \frac{\pi(1 + 2k)}{10}\) for \(k = 0, 1, \ldots, 9\). Let's list them:

</Plan_9>

<Execution_9>
<execution_9.1>
For \(k = 0\): \(\theta_0 = \frac{\pi(1 + 0)}{10} = \frac{\pi}{10}\)

For \(k = 1\): \(\theta_1 = \frac{\pi(1 + 2)}{10} = \frac{3\pi}{10}\)

For \(k = 2\): \(\theta_2 = \frac{\pi(1 + 4)}{10} = \frac{5\pi}{10} = \frac{\pi}{2}\)

For \(k = 3\): \(\theta_3 = \frac{\pi(1 + 6)}{10} = \frac{7\pi}{10}\)

For \(k = 4\): \(\theta_4 = \frac{\pi(1 + 8)}{10} = \frac{9\pi}{10}\)

For \(k = 5\): \(\theta_5 = \frac{\pi(1 + 10)}{10} = \frac{11\pi}{10}\)

For \(k = 6\): \(\theta_6 = \frac{\pi(1 + 12)}{10} = \frac{13\pi}{10}\)

For \(k = 7\): \(\theta_7 = \frac{\pi(1 + 14)}{10} = \frac{15\pi}{10} = \frac{3\pi}{2}\)

For \(k = 8\): \(\theta_8 = \frac{\pi(1 + 16)}{10} = \frac{17\pi}{10}\)

For \(k = 9\): \(\theta_9 = \frac{\pi(1 + 18)}{10} = \frac{19\pi}{10}\)

But note that cosine is periodic with period \(2\pi\), and even, so \(\cos\theta_k = \cos(\theta_k \mod 2\pi)\). Also, \(\cos\theta = \cos(-\theta)\). Let's compute each cosine term:

1. \(\cos\frac{\pi}{10}\)
2. \(\cos\frac{3\pi}{10}\)
3. \(\cos\frac{\pi}{2} = 0\)
4. \(\cos\frac{7\pi}{10}\)
5. \(\cos\frac{9\pi}{10}\)
6. \(\cos\frac{11\pi}{10} = \cos\left(\pi + \frac{\pi}{10}\right) = -\cos\frac{\pi}{10}\)
7. \(\cos\frac{13\pi}{10} = \cos\left(\pi + \frac{3\pi}{10}\right) = -\cos\frac{3\pi}{10}\)
8. \(\cos\frac{3\pi}{2} = 0\)
9. \(\cos\frac{17\pi}{10} = \cos\left(2\pi - \frac{3\pi}{10}\right) = \cos\frac{3\pi}{10}\)
10. \(\cos\frac{19\pi}{10} = \cos\left(2\pi - \frac{\pi}{10}\right) = \cos\frac{\pi}{10}\)

Therefore, the sum \(S\) is:

\(\cos\frac{\pi}{10} + \cos\frac{3\pi}{10} + 0 + \cos\frac{7\pi}{10} + \cos\frac{9\pi}{10} - \cos\frac{\pi}{10} - \cos\frac{3\pi}{10} - 0 + \cos\frac{3\pi}{10} + \cos\frac{\pi}{10}\)

Simplify term by term:

- The first term is \(\cos\frac{\pi}{10}\)
- The second term is \(\cos\frac{3\pi}{10}\)
- The third term is 0
- The fourth term is \(\cos\frac{7\pi}{10}\)
- The fifth term is \(\cos\frac{9\pi}{10}\)
- The sixth term is \(-\cos\frac{\pi}{10}\)
- The seventh term is \(-\cos\frac{3\pi}{10}\)
- The eighth term is 0
- The ninth term is \(\cos\frac{3\pi}{10}\)
- The tenth term is \(\cos\frac{\pi}{10}\)

Now, combining like terms:

- \(\cos\frac{\pi}{10} - \cos\frac{\pi}{10} + \cos\frac{\pi}{10} = \cos\frac{\pi}{10}\)
- \(\cos\frac{3\pi}{10} - \cos\frac{3\pi}{10} + \cos\frac{3\pi}{10} = \cos\frac{3\pi}{10}\)
- The fourth term: \(\cos\frac{7\pi}{10}\)
- The fifth term: \(\cos\frac{9\pi}{10}\)

But note that \(\cos\frac{7\pi}{10} = \cos\left(\pi - \frac{3\pi}{10}\right) = -\cos\frac{3\pi}{10}\)
Similarly, \(\cos\frac{9\pi}{10} = \cos\left(\pi - \frac{\pi}{10}\right) = -\cos\frac{\pi}{10}\)

Therefore, substituting these:

- Fourth term: \(-\cos\frac{3\pi}{10}\)
- Fifth term: \(-\cos\frac{\pi}{10}\)

Therefore, the total sum becomes:

\(\cos\frac{\pi}{10} + \cos\frac{3\pi}{10} - \cos\frac{3\pi}{10} - \cos\frac{\pi}{10} = 0\)

Wait, that can't be right. Let me check again. Wait, after substituting the fourth and fifth terms:

The sum is:

\(\cos\frac{\pi}{10} + \cos\frac{3\pi}{10} - \cos\frac{3\pi}{10} - \cos\frac{\pi}{10}\)

Which indeed cancels out to 0.

Looking back at the terms:

4. \(-\cos\frac{3\pi}{10}\)
5. \(-\cos\frac{\pi}{10}\)
6. \(\cos\frac{3\pi}{10}\)
7. \(\cos\frac{\pi}{10}\)

Wait, no, actually, after grouping:

The first term is \(\cos\frac{\pi}{10}\)

Second term is \(\cos\frac{3\pi}{10}\)

Fourth term is \(-\cos\frac{3\pi}{10}\)

Fifth term is \(-\cos\frac{\pi}{10}\)

Sixth term is \(\cos\frac{3\pi}{10}\)

Seventh term is \(\cos\frac{\pi}{10}\)

Wait, no, the original list after substitution is:

5. \(-\cos\frac{\pi}{10}\)

6. \(\cos\frac{3\pi}{10}\)

7. \(\cos\frac{\pi}{10}\)

8. 0

9. \(\cos\frac{3\pi}{10}\)

10. \(\cos\frac{\pi}{10}\)

So adding all these up:

\(\cos\frac{\pi}{10} + \cos\frac{3\pi}{10} + 0 - \cos\frac{3\pi}{10} - \cos\frac{\pi}{10} + \cos\frac{3\pi}{10} + \cos\frac{\pi}{10} + 0 + \cos\frac{3\pi}{10} + \cos\frac{\pi}{10}\)

Let's compute step by step:

Start with 0.

Add \(\cos\frac{\pi}{10}\): total = \(\cos\frac{\pi}{10}\)

Add \(\cos\frac{3\pi}{10}\): total = \(\cos\frac{\pi}{10} + \cos\frac{3\pi}{10}\)

Add 0: remains the same.

Subtract \(\cos\frac{3\pi}{10}\): total = \(\cos\frac{\pi}{10}\)

Subtract \(\cos\frac{\pi}{10}\): total = 0

Add \(\cos\frac{3\pi}{10}\): total = \(\cos\frac{3\pi}{10}\)

Add \(\cos\frac{\pi}{10}\): total = \(\cos\frac{3\pi}{10} + \cos\frac{\pi}{10}\)

Add 0: remains the same.

Add \(\cos\frac{3\pi}{10}\): total = \(\cos\frac{3\pi}{10} + \cos\frac{\pi}{10} + \cos\frac{3\pi}{10}\) = \(2 \cos\frac{3\pi}{10} + \cos\frac{\pi}{10}\)

Add \(\cos\frac{\pi}{10}\): total = \(2 \cos\frac{3\pi}{10} + 2 \cos\frac{\pi}{10}\)

So actually, the sum is \(2 \cos\frac{3\pi}{10} + 2 \cos\frac{\pi}{10}\), not zero. I must have made a mistake in the previous cancellation. Let me check again.

Wait, after step 7 (adding \(\cos\frac{\pi}{10}\)), the total is \(\cos\frac{\pi}{10}\). Then step 8 is adding \(\cos\frac{3\pi}{10}\), so total becomes \(\cos\frac{\pi}{10} + \cos\frac{3\pi}{10}\). Then step 9 is adding 0, no change. Step 10 is subtracting \(\cos\frac{\pi}{10}\), so total becomes \(\cos\frac{3\pi}{10}\). Step 11 is adding \(\cos\frac{3\pi}{10}\), total becomes \(2 \cos\frac{3\pi}{10}\). Step 12 is adding \(\cos\frac{\pi}{10}\), total becomes \(2 \cos\frac{3\pi}{10} + \cos\frac{\pi}{10}\). Then steps 13 and 14 are adding 0 and \(\cos\frac{\pi}{10}\), so total becomes \(2 \cos\frac{3\pi}{10} + 2 \cos\frac{\pi}{10}\).

+5: \(\cos\frac{\pi}{10} - \cos\frac{\pi}{10} = 0\)

+6: \(\cos\frac{3\pi}{10}\)

+7: \(\cos\frac{3\pi}{10} + \cos\frac{\pi}{10}\)

+8: remains same

+9: \(\cos\frac{3\pi}{10} + \cos\pi/10 + \cos\frac{3\pi}{10}\)

Wait, no, step 9 is adding \(\cos\frac{3\pi}{10}\), so total is \(\cos\frac{\pi}{10} + \cos\frac{3\pi}{10}\)

Then step 10 is adding \(\cos\frac{\pi}{10}\), so total is \(\cos\frac{\pi}{10} + \cos\frac{3\pi}{10} + \cos\frac{\pi}{10} = 2\cos\frac{\pi}{10} + \cos\frac{3\pi}{10}\)

But there is no step 11 or 12. Wait, the terms are 10 in total. Let me recount:

1. \(\cos\frac{\pi}{10}\)

2. \(\cos\frac{3\pi}{10}\)

3. 0

4. \(-\cos\frac{3\pi}{10}\)

5. \(-\cos\frac{\pi}{10}\)

6. \(\cos\frac{3\pi}{10}\)

7. \(\cos\frac{\pi}{10}\)

8. 0

9. \(\cos\frac{3\pi}{10}\)

10. \(\cos\frac{\pi}{10}\)

So after term 10, the total sum is:

\(\cos\frac{\pi}{10} + \cos\frac{3\pi}{10} - \cos\frac{3\pi}{10} - \cos\frac{\pi}{10} + \cos\frac{3\pi}{10} + \cos\frac{\pi}{10}\)

Simplify:

The first four terms: \(\cos\frac{\pi}{10} + \cos\frac{3\pi}{10} - \cos\frac{3\pi}{10} - \cos\frac{\pi}{10} = 0\)

Then adding the next two terms: \(0 + \cos\frac{3\pi}{10} + \cos\frac{\pi}{10}\)

Therefore, total sum \(S = \cos\frac{\pi}{10} + \cos\frac{3\pi}{10}\)
