<Question>
A worker receives an annual wage of $\$20{,}000$, which he always deposits into a savings account at the end of the year. By the end of the third year (when he makes the third deposit), he wants to have at least $\$66,200$ in the account to finance the purchase of a house. What is the minimal compound interest rate that the savings account must provide? Express your answer as a percentage, but do not include the percent sign.

Okay, let's see. The problem is about a worker who earns $20,000 annually and deposits it into a savings account at the end of each year. By the end of the third year, he wants to have at least $66,200 in the account. The question is asking for the minimal compound interest rate the savings account must provide. Hmm. Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to recall how compound interest works. The formula for the future value of a series of annual deposits (which is an annuity) is what I need here. Since he's depositing at the end of each year, it's an ordinary annuity. The formula for the future value of an ordinary annuity is FV = P * [(1 + r)^n - 1] / r, where P is the annual payment, r is the annual interest rate, and n is the number of years. Let me confirm that.
Yeah, that formula seems right. Each deposit earns interest for a different number of periods. For example, the first deposit (at the end of the first year) will earn interest for the next two years, the second deposit (end of second year) for one year, and the third deposit (end of third year) doesn't earn any interest after that.

Wait, but in this case, he's making three deposits over three years. So each deposit is made at the end of each year, and each one earns interest for the remaining years. Let me verify that.
Yes, exactly. So the first deposit of $20,000 is made at the end of year 1, so it earns interest for two more years (years 2 and 3). The second deposit is at the end of year 2, earning one year of interest. The third deposit is at the end of year 3, so it doesn't earn any interest after that.

So the total future value would be the sum of each deposit compounded accordingly.
So, breaking it down:
- First deposit: 20,000 * (1 + r)^2
- Second deposit: 20,000 * (1 + r)^1
- Third deposit: 20,000 * (1 + r)^0 = 20,000

So the total amount FV = 20,000*(1 + r)^2 + 20,000*(1 + r) + 20,000. And this should be at least 66,200.

So the equation is:

20,000*(1 + r)^2 + 20,000*(1 + r) + 20,000 ≥ 66,200

We can factor out the 20,000:

20,000 [ (1 + r)^2 + (1 + r) + 1 ] ≥ 66,200

Then divide both sides by 20,000:

(1 + r)^2 + (1 + r) + 1 ≥ 66,200 / 20,000

Let me compute 66,200 divided by 20,000.

But let's check with a slightly lower rate, say 5%.

How about 5.5%? Let's check that.

But to find the exact minimal rate, perhaps we need a more precise method. Let's set up the equation again.

66,200 ÷ 20,000 = 3.31

So the equation becomes:

(1 + r)^2 + (1 + r) + 1 ≥ 3.31

Let me simplify the left side. Let's let x = 1 + r. Then the equation becomes:

x^2 + x + 1 ≥ 3.31

Which simplifies to:

x^2 + x - 2.31 ≥ 0

So solving the quadratic equation x^2 + x - 2.31 = 0. To find the roots, we can use the quadratic formula:

x = [ -1 ± sqrt(1 + 4 * 2.31) ] / 2

Compute the discriminant first: 1 + 4 * 2.31 = 1 + 9.24 = 10.24

sqrt(10.24) is 3.2, since 3.2^2 = 10.24.

So x = [ -1 ± 3.2 ] / 2

Since x = 1 + r must be positive, we discard the negative root:

x = ( -1 + 3.2 ) / 2 = 2.2 / 2 = 1.1

Therefore, x = 1.1, so 1 + r = 1.1 => r = 0.1 or 10%.

FV = 20,000 [ (1.05)^2 + 1.05 + 1 ] = 20,000 [ 1.1025 + 1.05 + 1 ] = 20,000 * 3.1525 = 63,050. That's still below 66,200.
</execution_1.2>

<execution_1.3>
Wait, maybe 5.5% is the minimal rate. Let me check with 5.5%. Let's compute each term:

First term: 20,000*(1.055)^2. Let's compute (1.055)^2. 1.055*1.055. Let me compute that. 1*1=1, 1*0.055=0.055, 0.055*1=0.055, 0.055*0.055=0.003025. So adding up: 1 + 0.055 + 0.055 + 0.003025 = 1 + 0.11 + 0.003025 = 1.113025. So (1.055)^2 = 1.113025. Then 20,000*1.113025 = 22,260.50.

Second term: 20,000*(1.055) = 20,000*1.055 = 21,100.00.

Third term: 20,000.

Adding them up: 22,260.50 + 21,100.00 = 43,360.50 + 20,000 = 63,360.50. That's $63,360.50, which is still less than $66,200.

We have:

20,000*( (1 + r)^3 - 1 ) / r = 66,200

Wait, no. Wait, the formula for the future value of an ordinary annuity is indeed FV = P * [ ( (1 + r)^n - 1 ) / r ]. So in this case, P is 20,000, n is 3. So:

FV = 20,000 * [ ( (1 + r)^3 - 1 ) / r ] ≥ 66,200

So we can set up the equation:

20,000 * [ ( (1 + r)^3 - 1 ) / r ] = 66,200

Divide both sides by 20,000:

[ ( (1 + r)^3 - 1 ) / r ] = 66,200 / 20,000 = 3.31

So:

( (1 + r)^3 - 1 ) / r = 3.31

Let me denote x = 1 + r. Then, the equation becomes:

(x^3 - 1) / (x - 1) = 3.31

But (x^3 - 1)/(x - 1) simplifies to x^2 + x + 1. Because x^3 - 1 factors into (x - 1)(x^2 + x + 1). So yes, that's the same as before. So:

x^2 + x + 1 = 3.31

Which gives x^2 + x + 1 - 3.31 = 0 => x^2 + x - 2.31 = 0

But x = 1 + r, so solving for x:

x = [ -1 ± sqrt(1 + 9.24) ] / 2 = [ -1 ± sqrt(10.24) ] / 2

sqrt(10.24) is 3.2, so:

x = (-1 + 3.2)/2 = 2.2/2 = 1.1, or x = (-1 - 3.2)/2 = -2.1. Since x must be positive, x = 1.1. Therefore, r = 0.1 or 10%.

Wait, but if x = 1.1, then r = 0.1, which is 10%. But earlier, when I plugged in 10%, the result was exactly 66,200. So that suggests that 10% is the minimal rate.

Based on execution_1.1:
But let me verify this because sometimes when dealing with annuities, there might be a trick or something I missed.

Wait, let's check with r = 10%.
Let's compute each deposit's future value:

First deposit: 20,000 at the end of year 1. Compounded for 2 years: 20,000*(1.1)^2 = 20,000*1.21 = 24,200.

Second deposit: 20,000 at the end of year 2. Compounded for 1 year: 20,000*1.1 = 22,000.

Third deposit: 20,000 at the end of year 3. No interest: 20,000.

Total: 24,200 + 22,000 + 20,000 = 66,200. Exactly the amount needed. So 10% gives exactly $66,200. Therefore, the minimal rate is 10%?

Then, maybe 5.5% is not the right number.

Wait, but according to the quadratic equation solution, 10% is the exact answer. So maybe my trial with 5.5% was miscalculating.

Wait, no. Let's re-examine. The quadratic equation solution gives x = 1.1, so r = 0.1. Therefore, 10% is the exact answer.

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Then why did I do that trial with 5.5%? Maybe because I thought the answer might not be exact, but according to the mathematical derivation, 10% is the precise answer.

Let me confirm again.

The future value formula for an ordinary annuity with three payments is:

FV = 20,000 * [ (1.10)^2 + (1.10) + 1 ] = 20,000 [ 1.21 + 1.10 + 1 ] = 20,000 * 3.31 = 66,200. Exactly. So 10% is correct. Therefore, the minimal compound interest rate is 10%.

But wait, the problem says "compound interest rate," so is it annual compounding? The problem doesn't specify the compounding period, but since the deposits are annual and the interest is compounded annually (as per standard unless stated otherwise), it's safe to assume annual compounding. Therefore, the rate is 10% per annum.

But let me check if there's a lower rate that could also result in at least 66,200. Suppose we take a rate slightly less than 10%, say 9.5%.

Compute FV at 9.5%:

First deposit: 20,000*(1.095)^2 = 20,000*(1.199025) = 23,980.50

Second deposit: 20,000*1.095 = 21,900.00

Third deposit: 20,000

Total: 23,980.50 + 21,900.00 = 45,880.50 + 20,000 = 65,880.50, which is less than 66,200. So 9.5% is too low.

At 10%, it's exactly 66,200. So 10% is the minimal rate. Therefore, the answer is 10.

But let me confirm once again. Let's calculate 10%:

20,000*(1.1)^2 = 20,000*1.21=24,200

20,000*(1.1)=22,000

20,000*1=20,000

Total: 24,200+22,000=46,200+20,000=66,200. Perfect. So 10% is exact. Therefore, the minimal rate is 10%.

</Execution_3>

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
But let me consider if there's a different interpretation of the problem. For example, is the interest compounded more frequently than annually? The problem states "compound interest rate" without specifying, but since the deposits are made annually, it's logical to assume annual compounding. If it were compounded more frequently, the interest rate would be lower due to the effective annual rate. However, the problem asks for the compound interest rate, which is likely the nominal annual rate. Since the calculation aligns with 10% annual compounding, and the result is exact, there's no need for further adjustments.
Therefore, after thorough analysis and verification, the minimal compound interest rate required is 10%.

Therefore, the minimal compound interest rate that the savings account must provide is $\boxed{10\%}$.
