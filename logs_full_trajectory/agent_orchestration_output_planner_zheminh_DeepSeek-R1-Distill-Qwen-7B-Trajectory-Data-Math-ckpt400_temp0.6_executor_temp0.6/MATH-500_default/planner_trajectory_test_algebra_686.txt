Consider the geometric series $4+\frac{12}{a}+\frac{36}{a^2}+\cdots$. If the sum is a perfect square, what is the smallest possible value of $a$ where $a$ is a positive integer?
</Question>

<think>
<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to find the smallest positive integer value of \( a \) such that the sum of the geometric series \( 4 + \frac{12}{a} + \frac{36}{a^2} + \cdots \) is a perfect square. Hmm, let me start by recalling the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series.

First, the general formula for the sum \( S \) of an infinite geometric series with first term \( t_1 \) and common ratio \( r \) (where \( |r| < 1 \)) is \( S = \frac{t_1}{1 - r} \).

<prompt_1.1> Identify the first term and common ratio of the given geometric series and express the sum using the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
In this series, the first term \( t_1 \) is 4. Now, I need to determine the common ratio \( r \). To find \( r \), I can divide the second term by the first term. So, \( r = \frac{\frac{12}{a}}{4} = \frac{12}{a} \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{a} \). Let me check if this ratio is consistent with the next term.

The third term is \( \frac{36}{a^2} \). If I multiply the second term \( \frac{12}{a} \) by \( r = \frac{3}{a} \), I get \( \frac{12}{a} \times \frac{3}{a} = \frac{36}{a^2} \), which matches. So, the common ratio is indeed \( \frac{3}{a} \).
</execution_1.1>
</Execution_1>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Now, applying the formula for the sum of the series, we have:
\[
S = \frac{4}{1 - \frac{3}{a}} = \frac{4}{\frac{a - 3}{a}} = \frac{4a}{a - 3}
\]
So the sum simplifies to \( \frac{4a}{a - 3} \). The problem states that this sum must be a perfect square. Therefore, \( \frac{4a}{a - 3} \) should equal some integer squared, say \( n^2 \), where \( n \) is a positive integer.

So, setting up the equation:
\[
\frac{4a}{a - 3} = n^2
\]

Let me solve this equation for \( a \). First, multiply both sides by \( a - 3 \):
\[
4a = n^2(a - 3)
\]
Expanding the right side:
\[
4a = n^2a - 3n^2
\]
Let me collect terms involving \( a \) on one side. Subtract \( n^2a \) from both sides:
\[
4a - n^2a = -3n^2
\]
Factor out \( a \) from the left side:
\[
a(4 - n^2) = -3n^2
\]
Then, solving for \( a \):
\[
a = \frac{-3n^2}{4 - n^2}
\]
I can multiply numerator and denominator by -1 to make it look neater:
\[
a = \frac{3n^2}{n^2 - 4}
\]
So, \( a = \frac{3n^2}{n^2 - 4} \). Since \( a \) must be a positive integer, the denominator \( n^2 - 4 \) must divide \( 3n^2 \) exactly. Also, the denominator must be positive because \( a \) is positive.
Therefore, \( n^2 - 4 > 0 \implies n^2 > 4 \implies n > 2 \) (since \( n \) is a positive integer).

So possible values of \( n \) start from 3 upwards. Let me check for \( n = 3, 4, 5, \ldots \) and see which gives the smallest integer \( a \).

<prompt_2.1> Calculate \( a \) for \( n = 3, 4, 5, \ldots \) and check if \( a \) is a positive integer. </prompt_2.1>

But let me double-check my steps to ensure there's no mistake.

<prompt_2.2> Verify each step of the solution process to ensure there are no mistakes. </prompt_2.2>

Let me check with \( a = 12 \) to compute the sum and confirm it's 16.

<prompt_2.3> Compute the sum of the series for \( a = 12 \) to confirm it is a perfect square. </prompt_2.3>

But just to be thorough, maybe there's a smaller \( a \) if we consider \( n \) values beyond 3 but leading to smaller \( a \). Wait, but \( n \) must be greater than 2, so starting at 3.

<prompt_2.4> Confirm that \( a = 12 \) is the smallest possible value by checking for larger \( n \) values. </prompt_2.4>

But just to check another angle, maybe there's a way to express \( \frac{4a}{a - 3} \) as a square without substituting variables. Let me see.

<prompt_2.5> Explore alternative methods to express the sum as a square and confirm the result. </prompt_2.5>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Starting with \( n = 3 \):
\[
a = \frac{3 \times 9}{9 - 4} = \frac{27}{5} = 5.4
\]
Not an integer. Next, \( n = 4 \):
\[
a = \frac{3 \times 16}{16 - 4} = \frac{48}{12} = 4
\]
That's an integer. Wait, but let me check if this works. If \( a = 4 \), then the common ratio \( r = \frac{3}{4} \), which is less than 1, so the series converges. The sum would be \( \frac{4 \times 4}{4 - 3} = \frac{16}{1} = 16 \), which is \( 4^2 \), a perfect square. Hmm, so \( a = 4 \) gives a sum of 16. But wait, that seems smaller than 12.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Starting from the top: the series is geometric, first term 4, ratio 3/a. Then sum is 4 / (1 - 3/a) which simplifies to 4a/(a - 3). Then setting that equal to n², solving for a gives 3n²/(n² - 4). Then n must be greater than 2. For n=3, a=27/5 which is not integer. n=4 gives 48/12=4. Then n=5 gives 75/21 which is not integer. n=6 gives 108/32, not integer. n=7 gives 147/45, not integer. n=8 gives 192/60=3.2, no. n=12 gives 3*(144)/140=432/140=216/70=108/35, no. So yes, 4 is the first one.
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
First, the common ratio \( r = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4} \). Then the sum is \( \frac{4}{1 - 1/4} = \frac{4}{3/4} = \frac{16}{3} \). Wait, hold on! Wait, that's not 16. Wait, 4 divided by (3/4) is 4 * (4/3) = 16/3. But 16/3 is not a perfect square. Wait, that contradicts my previous conclusion. What's happening here?
</execution_2.3>

<execution_2.4>
Wait, but maybe for \( n = 4 \), we get \( a = 12 \), which is larger than previous ones. Wait, no. Let's compute each step properly.

Wait, when \( n = 3 \), we get \( a = 4 \). For \( n = 4 \), \( a = 3*(16)/(16 - 4) = 48/12 = 4 \). Wait, that's the same \( a \). Hmm. For \( n = 5 \), \( a = 3*25/(25 - 4) = 75/21 ≈ 3.57, which is not integer. For \( n = 6 \), \( a = 3*36/(36 -4) = 108/32 = 27/8 = 3.375, not integer. \( n = 7 \): 3*49/(49 -4) = 147/45 = 49/15 ≈3.266… not integer. \( n = 8 \): 3*64/(64 -4)=192/60=3.2, not integer. \( n =9 \): 3*81/(81-4)=243/77≈3.15, no. \( n=10\): 3*100/96=300/96=25/8=3.125. Not integer. Hmm. So the next possible \( n \) after 3 and 4 that gives integer \( a \) is 12.
</execution_2.4>

<execution_2.5>
Let me denote \( S = \frac{4a}{a - 3} \). Let \( S = k^2 \), where \( k \) is a positive integer. Then:

\( \frac{4a}{a - 3} = k^2 \)

Multiply both sides by \( a - 3 \):

\( 4a = k^2(a - 3) \)

Rearranged:

\( 4a = k^2a - 3k^2 \)

Bring terms with \( a \) to one side:

\( 4a - k^2a = -3k^2 \)

Factor:

\( a(4 - k^2) = -3k^2 \)

Multiply both sides by -1:

\( a(k^2 - 4) = 3k^2 \)

Hence:

\( a = \frac{3k^2}{k^2 - 4} \)

Which is the same expression as before, just replacing \( n \) with \( k \). So, same result. Therefore, the earlier steps are correct.

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Wait, this is confusing. Let me verify.

<prompt_3.1> Verify the calculations for \( n = 3 \) and \( n = 4 \) to ensure the sum is correct. </prompt_3.1>
-----

Based on execution_2.5:
Therefore, the answer should be 12. But let me check once more.

<prompt_3.2> Verify the final solution and confirm that \( a = 12 \) is correct. </prompt_3.2>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
If \( a = 4 \), then the common ratio \( r = \frac{3}{4} \), so the series is \( 4 + 3 + \frac{9}{4} + \cdots \). The sum is \( \frac{4}{1 - 3/4} = \frac{4}{1/4} = 16 \), which is indeed \( 4^2 \). So, that works. But then why did I get confused earlier? Because when I tried \( a = 4 \), I thought maybe the ratio is \( 3/4 \), but maybe I made a mistake in calculating the sum. Wait, no. Let me check again. If \( a = 4 \), then the second term is \( 12/4 = 3 \), third term is \( 36/16 = 9/4 \), so the ratio between second and first term is \( 3/4 \), and between third and second term is \( (9/4)/3 = 3/4 \). So the ratio is consistent. Then the sum is \( 4/(1 - 3/4) = 16 \), which is 4 squared. So, that's valid. Therefore, \( a = 4 \) is a possible solution.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
If \( a = 4 \), sum is \( 4a/(a - 3) = 16/1 = 16 \), which is 4 squared. But when \( a = 4 \), the common ratio is \( 3/4 \), so the series is 4 + 3 + 9/4 + 27/16 + ... which sums to 16. That's correct. But earlier when I thought \( a = 12 \) gives sum 16, that was a miscalculation. Wait, no. Let's recalculate:

If \( a = 12 \), then the sum is \( 4a/(a - 3) = 4*12/(12 - 3) = 48/9 = 16/3 \), which is approximately 5.333...., not 16. So that's not a perfect square. Therefore, my mistake was in the previous calculation where I thought \( a = 4 \) gives sum 16, which is correct, and \( a = 12 \) gives 16/3, which is not. Therefore, the correct answer is \( a = 4 \).
</execution_3.2>
</Execution_3>

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
But the problem asks for the smallest possible value of \( a \). Wait, but \( a = 4 \) is smaller than 12. But let me check if there are any smaller values of \( a \) that satisfy the condition. Wait, but according to the equation, \( n \) must be greater than 2.

<prompt_4.1> Verify if there are any smaller values of \( a \) that satisfy the condition by checking smaller \( n \) values. </prompt_4.1>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
So n starts at 3. For n=3, we get a=27/5=5.4, which is not an integer. So the next possible n is 4, giving a=4, which is an integer. So 4 is the smallest possible a.
</execution_4.1>
</Execution_4>

<Plan_5>
Based on execution_4.1:
But let me confirm once again. Let's check \( a = 4 \).

<prompt_5.1> Verify the solution by checking the calculations for \( a = 4 \). </prompt_5.1>
</Plan_5>

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
The series becomes 4 + 12/4 + 36/16 + 108/64 + ... which is 4 + 3 + 2.25 + 1.6875 + ... The sum is indeed 4/(1 - 3/4) = 16. So 16 is a perfect square. Therefore, a=4 is valid. But wait, the problem asks for the smallest possible value of a. But a must be a positive integer. So 4 is smaller than 12, so why did I initially think 12 was the answer? Maybe I made a mistake in my earlier calculation.
</execution_5.1>
</Execution_5>

<Plan_6>
Based on execution_5.1:
But let me check if there's a smaller a. Wait, a must be greater than 3 because the denominator in the common ratio 3/a must be positive, and also for the series to converge, |r| < 1, so 3/a < 1 => a > 3.

<prompt_6.1> Verify if there is a smaller value of \( a \) by checking possible values between 3 and 4. </prompt_6.1>
</Plan_6>

<Execution_6>
<execution_6.1>
So a must be greater than 3. Since a is a positive integer, the possible values start from 4 upwards. So 4 is the smallest possible integer value for a. Therefore, the answer should be 4. But then why did I initially think of 12? Because when I first considered n=4, I thought that gives a=4, but then when I tried a=4, I thought the sum was 16, which is correct. So why did I doubt it earlier? Maybe because I confused the value of n with a. So, the correct answer is a=4.
</execution_6.1>
</Execution_6>

<Plan_7>
Based on execution_6.1:
Wait, but let me check if there are any other possible n values that could give a smaller a. For example, n=5 gives a=75/21≈3.571, which is not integer. n=6 gives 108/32=27/8=3.375, not integer. n=7 gives 147/45≈3.266, nope. n=8 gives 192/60=3.2, nope. n=9 gives 243/77≈3.15, nope. n=10 gives 300/96=3.125, nope. So, indeed, the next possible integer a occurs at n=4, giving a=4. Therefore, 4 is the smallest possible value.

But wait, let me check if n=1 or n=2 gives anything. For n=1, the sum would be 1, so setting 4a/(a-3)=1 => 4a = a -3 => 3a = -3 => a=-1, which is not a positive integer. For n=2, sum=4, so 4a/(a-3)=4 => 4a=4(a-3) =>4a=4a-12 =>0=-12, which is impossible. So n must be at least 3.

<prompt_7.1> Confirm that \( a = 4 \) is indeed the smallest possible value by checking for other \( n \) values and confirming no smaller \( a \) exists. </prompt_7.1>
</Plan_7>

<Execution_7>
<execution_7.1>
Therefore, the only possible a values are those obtained from n=3 and above. Since n=3 gives a=5.4 (non-integer), the next n=4 gives a=4, which is valid. Therefore, a=4 is the smallest possible integer value. So the answer should be 4.

But wait, the problem says "the sum is a perfect square". If a=4, sum is 16, which is 4 squared. So that's correct. Therefore, the answer is 4.
</execution_7.1>
</Execution_7>

<Plan_8>
Based on execution_7.1:
But let me check once more. Let me list possible a values and compute the sum:

<prompt_8.1> Perform a final verification of the solution by listing possible \( a \) values and computing their sums. </prompt_8.1>
</Plan_8>

<Execution_8>
<execution_8.1>
a=4: sum=16=4² ✔️

a=12: sum=16/3 ❌

a=27/5=5.4: not integer ❌

a=3n²/(n²-4) for n=5: 75/21≈3.571 ❌

So yes, a=4 is the only integer value in this sequence that works, and it's the smallest possible. Therefore, the answer is 4.
</execution_8.1>
</Execution_8>

<Plan_9>
Based on execution_8.1:
Wait, but let me check if there's another approach. Suppose we let the sum S = 4a/(a - 3) = k². Then rearranged:

<prompt_9.1> Re-evaluate the solution using an alternative approach and confirm the final answer. </prompt_9.1>
</Plan_9>

<Execution_9>
<execution_9.1>
4a = k²(a - 3)

4a = k²a - 3k²

4a - k²a = -3k²

a(4 - k²) = -3k²

a = 3k²/(k² - 4)

Same as before. So, k² must be greater than 4, so k >=3. For k=3:

a=3*9/(9-4)=27/5=5.4 ❌

k=4:

a=3*16/(16-4)=48/12=4 ✔️

k=5:

3*25/21≈3.571 ❌

k=6:

3*36/28≈3.857 ❌

k=8:

3*64/56=192/56=24/8=3.2 ❌

k=12:

3*144/136=432/136=108/34≈3.176 ❌

So, indeed, only when k=4 do we get an integer a=4. Therefore, 4 is the smallest possible value. Therefore, the answer is 4.

But wait, the original problem says "the sum is a perfect square". So 16 is a perfect square, which is correct. Therefore, the answer is 4. But in the earlier miscalculation when I thought a=12 gives sum=16, that was wrong. So the correct answer is a=4. Therefore, the smallest possible a is 4.
</execution_9.1>
</Execution_9>

<Final_answer>
Thus, the smallest possible value of $a$ where $a$ is a positive integer is $\boxed{4}$.
