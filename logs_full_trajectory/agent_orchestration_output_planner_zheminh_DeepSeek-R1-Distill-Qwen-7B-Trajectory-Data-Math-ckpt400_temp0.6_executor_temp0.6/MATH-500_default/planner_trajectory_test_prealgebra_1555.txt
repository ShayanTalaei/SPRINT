Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the value of this expression: 5^5 ÷ 5^4 - 5^3 + 5^2 · 5^1. Hmm, right. Let me break it down step by step. First, I remember that when dealing with exponents, there are rules about dividing and multiplying same-base terms. Maybe I can simplify each part before doing the arithmetic. Let me write down each term separately.

Starting with the first term: 5^5 ÷ 5^4. Since they have the same base, when you divide exponents, you subtract the exponents. So 5^(5-4) which is 5^1, so that's 5.

Next term is -5^3. That's straightforward.
5^3 is 5*5*5 = 125, so this term is -125.

Then the last term is 5^2 · 5^1. When multiplying exponents with the same base, you add the exponents.
So 5^(2+1) = 5^3. Wait, 5^3 is 125 again. So putting it all together: 5 - 125 + 125.

Let me check that again.
First term: 5^5 ÷ 5^4 = 5^(5-4) = 5^1 = 5.

Second term: -5^3 = -125.

Third term: 5^2 · 5^1 = 5^(2+1) = 5^3 = 125.

So combining them: 5 - 125 + 125.

Hmm, so 5 minus 125 is -120, then plus 125.
Wait, -120 + 125 is 5. So the result is 5?

But let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute each term numerically without using exponent rules.

<prompt_1.1> Verify the solution by computing each term numerically without using exponent rules. </prompt_1.1>

Wait, that seems too simple. Let me check if I interpreted the original expression correctly. The original expression is 5^5 ÷ 5^4 - 5^3 + 5^2 · 5^1. So order of operations: division and multiplication before addition and subtraction.

<prompt_1.2> Re-evaluate the solution by considering the order of operations and simplifying the expression using exponent rules. </prompt_1.2>

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to look at it. Let's compute each term step by step:

<prompt_1.3> Explore an alternative method to solve the expression by computing each term step by step. </prompt_1.3>

Alternatively, maybe someone could make a mistake by misplacing the order of operations. For example, if someone did 5^5 ÷ (5^4 - 5^3) + 5^2 ·5^1, but in the original problem, the division is only applied to the first term. Let me check the original expression again: 5^5 ÷5^4 -5^3 +5^2·5^1.

<prompt_1.4> Confirm the solution by ensuring the order of operations is correctly applied and confirm the final answer. </prompt_1.4>

<execution_1.1>
5^5 is 3125, 5^4 is 625. So 3125 ÷ 625. Let's divide that. 625 times 5 is 3125, so that's 5. Then 5^3 is 125, so subtracting that gives 5 - 125 = -120. Then 5^2 is 25, 5^1 is 5, so 25*5=125. Adding that to -120 gives -120 + 125 = 5.
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
So first handle division and multiplication from left to right.

First operation: 5^5 ÷ 5^4. As before, that's 5. Then next operation is multiplication: 5^2 ·5^1 = 25 ·5 = 125. Then we have 5 - 125 + 125. Which is 5.
</execution_1.2>

<execution_1.3>
First, compute 5^5: 5*5=25, 25*5=125, 125*5=625, 625*5=3125. So 5^5 is 3125. Then divide by 5^4. 5^4 is 5*5=25, 25*5=125, 125*5=625. So 3125 ÷ 625. Let's do that division: 625*5 = 3125, so that's 5. So first term is 5.

Second term is -5^3. 5^3 is 125, so that's -125.

Third term is 5^2 multiplied by 5^1. 5^2 is 25, 5^1 is 5, so 25*5=125. So third term is +125.

Adding them up: 5 - 125 + 125. Let's compute 5 -125 first, which is -120. Then -120 +125 is 5.
</execution_1.3>

<execution_1.4>
So division is between 5^5 and 5^4, then subtraction of 5^3, then addition of 5^2·5^1. So no, the division is only between the first two terms. So my previous steps are correct.

Alternatively, maybe if someone miscalculates 5^5 ÷5^4 as 5^(5/4) instead of 5^(5-4). But no, division of exponents with the same base is subtraction, not division. So that's not a concern here.

Another possible mistake could be miscalculating 5^3 as 125, but 5*5=25, 25*5=125, that's right. 5^2 is 25, 5^1 is 5, so 25*5=125. Correct.

So combining 5 -125 +125: 5 + (-125 +125) =5 +0=5. So yes, the answer is 5.

Wait, but let me check once more. Maybe I misread the original problem. Let's write it out again:

5^5 ÷5^4 -5^3 +5^2 ·5^1.

Yes, that's correct. So division first: 5. Then subtraction: -125. Then addition: +125. So 5 -125 +125.

Based on execution_1.2, execution_1.3, execution_1.4:
The result is 5. Hmm, interesting. So even though there are some large numbers involved, they cancel out in the end. So the final answer is 5.
Expressed as an integer, that's just 5.

Let me check using another approach. Maybe factorizing terms.

<prompt_2.1> Verify the solution using factorization and ensure no arithmetic errors are present. </prompt_2.1>

<execution_2.1>
Looking at the original expression: 5^5 ÷5^4 -5^3 +5^2 ·5^1. Let's rewrite each term:

First term: 5^(5-4) =5^1=5.

Second term: -5^3= -5^3.

Third term:5^(2+1)=5^3=125.

So the expression becomes 5 -5^3 +5^3. Then, the -5^3 and +5^3 cancel each other, leaving 5. So that's another way to see it. So regardless of how you compute it, it's 5.

<Final_answer>
Therefore, the expression $5^5\div5^4-5^3+5^2\cdot5^1$ simplifies to the integer $\boxed{5}$.
