</Question>

<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of three numbers: 3339, 2961, and 1491. Hmm, let me remember how to do this. The GCD of multiple numbers is the largest number that divides all of them without leaving a remainder. I think the best way to approach this is by using the Euclidean algorithm. Let me recall how that works.

The Euclidean algorithm is a method to find the GCD of two numbers by repeatedly applying division, where you divide the larger number by the smaller one, take the remainder, and then repeat the process with the smaller number and the remainder. You keep doing this until the remainder is zero, and the last non-zero remainder is the GCD. Right, so for three numbers, I can find the GCD of two first, then find the GCD of that result with the third number. That should give me the GCD of all three.
So, first, let me find GCD(3339, 2961), and then take that result and find GCD with 1491.

Starting with 3339 and 2961. Let me apply the Euclidean algorithm step by step.

Now, take that GCD, which is 21, and find GCD(21, 1491). Let me do that.

<prompt_1.2> Use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of 21 and 1491. </prompt_1.2>

Alternatively, maybe I can check if there's a higher common divisor. Let's see.

<execution_1.1>
Divide 3339 by 2961. How many times does 2961 go into 3339? Let's see, 2961 * 1 = 2961. Subtract that from 3339: 3339 - 2961 = 378. So the remainder is 378.

Now, replace the original numbers with 2961 and 378. Next step: divide 2961 by 378. Let me calculate how many times 378 fits into 2961. 378 * 7 = 2646. Subtract that from 2961: 2961 - 2646 = 315. So the remainder is 315.

Now, take 378 and 315. Divide 378 by 315. 315 * 1 = 315. Subtract: 378 - 315 = 63. Remainder is 63.

Next, divide 315 by 63. Well, 63 * 5 = 315 exactly, so the remainder is 0. Since the remainder is 0, the last non-zero remainder is 63. Therefore, GCD(3339, 2961) is 63.

<execution_1.2>
Dividing 1491 by 21. Let's compute that. 21*70 = 1470. Subtracting that from 1491 gives 1491 - 1470 = 21. So 21*71 = 1491. So the remainder is 0. Therefore, the GCD of 21 and 1491 is 21.
</execution_1.2>

<execution_1.3>
The prime factors of 21 are 3 and 7. Let's check if 3 or 7 divide all three numbers. We already know 21 divides them, so 3 and 7 must also divide all three numbers. Let's confirm:

3339: 3+3+3+9 = 18, which is divisible by 3. 2961: 2+9+6+1 = 18, divisible by 3. 1491: 1+4+9+1 = 15, divisible by 3. So 3 is a common divisor.

Similarly, 7: Let's divide each number by 7.

3339 ÷ 7: 7*477 = 3339. Exactly. 2961 ÷ 7: 7*423 = 2961. Exactly. 1491 ÷ 7: 7*213 = 1491. Exactly. So 7 is also a common divisor. Therefore, GCD is 3*7=21.

Wait a second, maybe I made a mistake in my calculations? Let me check each step again to be sure.

But just to be thorough, maybe I should check another pair first? Let me try finding GCD(1491, 3339) and then GCD of that with 2961. Maybe that will confirm the result.

Alternatively, maybe check if 21 is indeed the GCD. Let's see if there's a higher number that divides all three.

First step: 3339 divided by 2961. 2961 * 1 = 2961. Subtract from 3339: 3339 - 2961 = 378. Correct. So remainder 378.

Second step: 2961 divided by 378. Let's see, 378 * 7 = 2646. 2961 - 2646 = 315. Correct. Remainder 315.

Third step: 378 divided by 315. 315 * 1 = 315. 378 - 315 = 63. Correct. Remainder 63.

Fourth step: 315 divided by 63. 63 * 5 = 315. Remainder 0. So yes, GCD is 63.

<execution_2.2>
First, GCD(1491, 3339). Divide 3339 by 1491. 1491*2 = 2982. Subtract from 3339: 3339 - 2982 = 357. So remainder 357.

Now, GCD(1491, 357). Divide 1491 by 357. Let's see, 357*4 = 1428. Subtract from 1491: 1491 - 1428 = 63. Remainder 63.

Then GCD(357, 63). Divide 357 by 63: 63*5 = 315. Subtract: 357 - 315 = 42. Remainder 42.

GCD(63, 42). 63 ÷ 42 = 1 with remainder 21.

GCD(42, 21). 42 ÷ 21 = 2 with remainder 0. So GCD is 21. Then GCD(21, 2961). Since 2961 ÷ 21 = 141, which is exact. So GCD is 21. Same result.
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
Let's see, the next possible divisor after 21 would be 42. Let's check if 42 divides all three numbers.

3339 ÷ 42: 42*79 = 3318. 3339 - 3318 = 21. So remainder 21. So 42 does not divide 3339. Therefore, 42 is out.

How about 63? We already saw that 63 divides 3339 and 2961, but does it divide 1491? 1491 ÷ 63: 63*23 = 1449. 1491 - 1449 = 42. So remainder 42. So 63 doesn't divide 1491. Therefore, 63 is not a common divisor.

So the next step is to confirm that 21 is indeed the highest. Since there are no higher numbers that divide all three, 21 must be the GCD.

Based on execution_2.2:
But just to ensure, perhaps factorizing each number into primes? Let's try that.

<prompt_3.1> Perform prime factorization of each number to confirm the GCD. </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
Starting with 1491. Let's factorize 1491. 1491 ÷ 3 = 497 (since 1+4+9+1=15, divisible by 3). Then 497: check divisibility. 497 ÷ 7 = 71, because 7*70=490, 497-490=7, so 7*71=497. So 1491 = 3 * 7 * 71.

Next, 2961. Let's divide by 3: 2+9+6+1=18, divisible by 3. 2961 ÷ 3 = 987. Then 987 ÷ 3 = 329. 329: check divisibility. 329 ÷ 7 = 47, since 7*40=280, 329-280=49, which is 7*7. So 329=7*47. Therefore, 2961=3*3*7*47.

Now, 3339. Let's check divisibility by 3: 3+3+3+9=18, yes. 3339 ÷ 3 = 1113. 1113 ÷ 3 = 371. 371: check divisibility. 371 ÷ 7 = 53, since 7*50=350, 371-350=21, which is 7*3. So 371=7*53. Thus, 3339=3*3*7*53.

So the prime factors:

3339: 3² * 7 * 53

2961: 3² * 7 * 47

1491: 3 * 7 * 71

The GCD is the product of the smallest powers of the common primes. The common primes are 3 and 7. The smallest power of 3 is 1 (since 1491 has 3^1), and 7^1. So GCD = 3 * 7 = 21. That matches our previous result.

Based on execution_3.1:
Wait, but let me just check if there's a mistake in the factorization. Let me verify the prime factors again.

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
Starting with 1491: 1491 ÷ 3 = 497. 497 ÷ 7 = 71. 71 is a prime number. So 1491 = 3 * 7 * 71. Correct.

2961 ÷ 3 = 987. 987 ÷ 3 = 329. 329 ÷ 7 = 47. 47 is prime. So 2961 = 3² * 7 * 47. Correct.

3339 ÷ 3 = 1113. 1113 ÷ 3 = 371. 371 ÷ 7 = 53. 53 is prime. So 3339 = 3² * 7 * 53. Correct.

So the common factors are indeed 3 and 7, each to the first power. So 3*7=21.

Therefore, after multiple methods—applying the Euclidean algorithm step-by-step, verifying through factorization, and cross-checking with different orders of division—it's clear that the GCD of 3339, 2961, and 1491 is 21. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning, and all approaches converge to the same answer.
