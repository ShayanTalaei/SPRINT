<Plan_1>
Okay, let's see. I need to find the measure of the largest angle in a convex quadrilateral where the largest angle is twice the smallest one, and the other two angles are right angles (90 degrees each). Hmm, let's start by recalling some basics about quadrilaterals.

<prompt_1.1> Recall the properties of convex quadrilaterals and the sum of their interior angles. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
First, I remember that the sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateral is 360 degrees. That's a key point. Since it's a convex quadrilateral, all angles must be less than 180 degrees. That's important because if any angle were 180 degrees or more, the shape would be concave or a straight line, which isn't allowed here.
</execution_1.1>
</Execution_1>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Let me denote the angles. Let's say the smallest angle is x degrees. Then the largest angle, which is twice the smallest, would be 2x degrees. The other two angles are right angles, so each is 90 degrees.
So, adding them all up: x + 2x + 90 + 90 = 360. Let me write that equation down:

<prompt_2.1> Set up and solve the equation for the sum of the angles. </prompt_2.1>

But wait, in a convex quadrilateral, all angles must be less than 180 degrees. Let me check if there's any other constraints.

<prompt_2.2> Verify the convexity condition for the angles. </prompt_2.2>

Another thing to consider: Could there be another configuration where the largest angle is adjacent to the smallest angle? But in a quadrilateral, the arrangement of angles can vary depending on the shape. However, since we're only given the measures of the angles and not their positions, the sum remains the same regardless of their order.
So even if the largest angle is next to the smallest, the sum would still be x + 2x + 90 +90 = 360. So the values would still hold.

Also, just to make sure there's no trick here. Sometimes problems can have multiple solutions or require considering different cases.

<prompt_2.3> Ensure no other configurations or cases are considered. </prompt_2.3>

Wait, but let me just think again. Suppose the quadrilateral is convex, so all angles are less than 180.
If the largest angle is 140, which is less than 180, that's okay. The smallest angle is 70, which is also less than 180.

Is there a case where if the largest angle is twice the smallest, but maybe another angle is the smallest? For example, if two angles are the smallest, and the other two are right angles.
But in this problem, it's stated that the largest is twice the smallest, and the other two are right angles. So the other two (apart from the largest and smallest) are right angles. So that's exactly the case we considered: one smallest (x), one largest (2x), and two right angles.
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
x + 2x + 90 + 90 = 360

Combining like terms: 3x + 180 = 360

Subtract 180 from both sides: 3x = 180

Divide by 3: x = 60

So the smallest angle is 60 degrees, the largest is 120 degrees, and the other two are 90 each.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
The largest angle is 2x. Since the quadrilateral is convex, 2x must be less than 180. Therefore, 2x < 180, which means x < 90. But wait, x is the smallest angle. If the other two angles are 90 degrees, which are right angles, then x must be less than 90. But in our calculation, x was 70, which is less than 90, so that's okay. So 70, 90, 90, 140. All less than 180.
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
For example, maybe the quadrilateral could be a trapezoid or some other specific type, but the problem doesn't specify that. It just says convex. So regardless of the type, the sum of the angles is 360, and the given conditions apply.
</execution_2.3>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Let me check if that adds up.
60 + 120 + 90 + 90 = 360.
-----

Based on execution_2.2:
But let me confirm again.

<prompt_3.1> Reconfirm the convexity condition with the calculated angle. </prompt_3.1>
-----

Wait, but let me check again.

<prompt_3.2> Recheck the calculations and confirm the largest angle. </prompt_3.2>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
If the largest angle is 140, which is less than 180, so that's okay. The smallest angle is 70, which is also less than 180. So both the largest and the smallest angles are valid in a convex quadrilateral.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
If the angles are 70, 90, 90, 140, their sum is 70+90+90+140 = 70+90=160, 160+90=250, 250+140=390? Wait, wait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, 70+90 is 160, plus another 90 is 250, plus 140 is 390? That's over 360. Wait, that's a problem. Did I miscalculate?
</execution_3.2>
</Execution_3>

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.2:
Wait, that can't be. Wait, 70 + 2*70 is 70 + 140 = 210, plus 90 +90 = 180. 210 + 180 = 390. Wait, that's 390, which is way over 360. That's a mistake. Wait, no, hold on.
Wait, x is 70. So 70 + 140 + 90 +90.

<prompt_4.1> Correct the miscalculation in the sum of the angles. </prompt_4.1>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
Let me add them again. 70 + 140 = 210. 90 +90 = 180. 210 + 180 = 390. That's not 360. Wait, this is a problem. Did I make a mistake earlier? Because earlier when I set up the equation, x + 2x +90 +90 = 3x + 180 = 360. So 3x = 180, x=60. Then 2x=120. Then the angles are 60, 120, 90, 90. Adding those: 60+120=180, 90+90=180. 180+180=360. That works. But in my previous calculation, I mistakenly used x=70, which was wrong. So x=60. So the angles are 60, 120, 90, 90. Sum is 60+120+90+90=360. Perfect.
</execution_4.1>
</Execution_4>

<Plan_5>
Based on execution_4.1:
So the largest angle is 120 degrees. Then why did I get confused earlier?
Because I mistakenly substituted x=70, which isn't the case. The x here is 60, so 2x=120. So that's correct. So the largest angle is 120 degrees. Therefore, the answer is 120.
-----

So the answer is 120 degrees.
Therefore, the largest angle is 120 degrees. But let me just check once more to be thorough.

<prompt_5.1> Verify the solution once more to ensure correctness. </prompt_5.1>
</Plan_5>

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
The sum is 60+120+90+90=360. All angles are less than 180, so convex. The largest is twice the smallest. The other two are right angles. Yep, that's exactly the case. So 120 degrees is the correct answer.
</execution_5.1>
</Execution_5>

<Final_answer>
Therefore, the measure of the largest angle in the convex quadrilateral is $\boxed{120^\circ}$.
