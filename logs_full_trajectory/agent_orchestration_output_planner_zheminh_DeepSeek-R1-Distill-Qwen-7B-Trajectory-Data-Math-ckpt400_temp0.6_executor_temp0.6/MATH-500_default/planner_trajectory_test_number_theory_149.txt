<Question>
A group of $N$ students, where $N < 50$, is on a field trip. If their teacher puts them in groups of 8, the last group has 5 students. If their teacher instead puts them in groups of 6, the last group has 3 students. What is the sum of all possible values of $N$?

Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, we have a number of students N, less than 50. When the teacher divides them into groups of 8, the last group has 5 students. If instead the teacher uses groups of 6, the last group has 3 students. We need to find all possible N and add them up. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, when dividing into groups of 8 and having 5 left over, that means N divided by 8 gives a remainder of 5.
So mathematically, that can be written as N ≡ 5 mod 8. Similarly, when divided into groups of 6 with 3 left over, that's N ≡ 3 mod 6.

So we need numbers N < 50 that satisfy both these congruences. Let me recall how to solve systems of congruences. Maybe using the Chinese Remainder Theorem? But since 8 and 6 aren't coprime, the theorem might not directly apply, but there might still be solutions if the remainders are compatible.

Let me think. Let's first list numbers less than 50 that are congruent to 5 mod 8. Then check which of those are also congruent to 3 mod 6.

Starting with N ≡ 5 mod 8. The numbers would be 5, 13, 21, 29, 37, 45, 53, etc. But since N < 50, we can stop at 45.

<prompt_1.1> List all numbers less than 50 that are congruent to 5 mod 8. </prompt_1.1>

Alternatively, maybe another approach: Let's represent N as 8k +5. Then this expression must satisfy 8k +5 ≡3 mod6. Let's solve for k:

<execution_1.1>
Wait, 5 + 8 =13, 13+8=21, 21+8=29, 29+8=37, 37+8=45, 45+8=53 which is over 50, so stop. So possible Ns are 5,13,21,29,37,45.
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
8k +5 ≡3 mod6

8k ≡3 -5 mod6

8k ≡-2 mod6

But -2 mod6 is 4, so 8k ≡4 mod6

But 8 mod6 is 2, so 2k ≡4 mod6

Divide both sides by 2: k ≡2 mod3

So k=3m +2 for integer m.

Therefore, N=8*(3m +2)+5=24m +21

So N=21,45,69,... But since N <50, possible N are 21 and 45. Same result as before. So that's another way to get the same answers.

Based on execution_1.1:
Now check which of these numbers are ≡3 mod6.

<prompt_2.1> Check which numbers from the list that are congruent to 5 mod 8 are also congruent to 3 mod 6. </prompt_2.1>

Based on execution_1.2:
So the possible values are 21 and 45. Sum is 66. Therefore, the answer is 66.

<prompt_2.2> Conclude the solution by verifying the sum of possible values and confirming the final answer. </prompt_2.2>

<execution_2.1>
Let's check each:

5 divided by 6 is 0 with remainder 5. Not 3. So discard.

13 divided by 6 is 2 with remainder 1. Not 3. Next.

21 divided by 6 is 3 with remainder 3. Yes! So 21 is a candidate.

29 divided by 6: 6*4=24, 29-24=5. Remainder 5. Not 3.

37 divided by 6: 6*6=36, remainder 1. Not 3.

45 divided by 6: 6*7=42, remainder 3. Yes! So 45 is another candidate.

So from the list, 21 and 45 satisfy both conditions.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Wait, but let me just make sure there's not another way to get more numbers. For example, maybe if we considered negative numbers? But N is a number of students, so must be positive. So starting from 21, adding 24 each time. 21,45,69... but 69 is over 50, so no. So only 21 and 45. So sum is 66. Yeah, that seems right.

Wait, but let me check the original list: 5,13,21,29,37,45. From those, 21 and 45 are the ones that are 3 mod6. 5 mod6 is 5, 13 mod6 is 1, 21 mod6 is 21-3*6=21-18=3, so yes 3. 29 mod6: 29-4*6=29-24=5. 37 mod6: 37-6*6=37-36=1. 45 mod6:45-7*6=45-42=3. So yes, 21 and 45. So sum is 66. I think that's correct. I don't see any other numbers in the range. So the answer should be 66.

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Wait, but let me verify each condition again for these numbers.

<prompt_3.1> Verify the solution by rechecking the conditions for the numbers 21 and 45. </prompt_3.1>

**Final Answer**
The sum of all possible values of \( N \) is \boxed{66}.
