<Question>
Alice and Bob are playing a game. Alice starts first. On Alice's turn, she flips a coin. If she gets a heads, she wins. If not, it becomes Bob's turn. On Bob's turn, he flips a coin. If he gets a tails, he wins. If not, it becomes Alice's turn. What is the probability that Alice wins the game?

Okay, let's try to figure out the probability that Alice wins this game. So, the game starts with Alice flipping a coin. If she gets heads, she wins immediately. If not, then Bob gets a turn. Bob flips a coin, and if he gets tails, he wins. If he doesn't, it goes back to Alice, and the game continues like that. Hmm, so it's like a turn-based game with alternating players, each having different conditions to win.

First, let me break down the probabilities step by step.

<prompt_1.1> Break down the probabilities of Alice winning on her first turn and Bob winning on his first turn. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

Each coin flip is independent, right? So, the probability of Alice getting heads on her first flip is 1/2. That's straightforward. If she doesn't get heads (which also has a probability of 1/2), then Bob gets his turn. Now, Bob flips the coin, and if he gets tails, he wins. The probability of tails is 1/2 as well. So, the probability that Bob wins on his first turn would be the probability that Alice didn't win multiplied by the probability Bob wins, which is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

Based on execution_1.1:
But if Bob doesn't get tails, which is also a probability of 1/2, then the game goes back to Alice. So, the game essentially resets, right? It's like starting over from the beginning but with both players having failed once.

So, maybe we can model this with some sort of recursive probability. Let me denote the probability that Alice wins the game as P.

So, initially, Alice has a 1/2 chance to win immediately. If she doesn't (which is also 1/2), then Bob has a 1/2 chance to win. If Bob doesn't win (again 1/2), then it's Alice's turn again, and the probability of Alice winning from that point is still P. So, putting this into an equation:

<prompt_2.1> Formulate an equation for the probability that Alice wins the game using the above plan. </prompt_2.1>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
P = (Probability Alice wins on first turn) + (Probability game continues to Bob's turn and Alice wins from there)

But wait, the game can only continue to Bob's turn if Alice doesn't win, which is 1/2. Then, Bob has a 1/2 chance to win, so the probability that the game continues back to Alice is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4. Then, from that point, the probability Alice wins is P again. So, putting that into the equation:

P = (1/2) + (1/4) * P

Is that right?

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Let me check.

<prompt_3.1> Solve the equation P = 1/2 + 1/4 * P to find the probability that Alice wins the game using the above plan. </prompt_3.1>

Alternatively, maybe we can model this as an infinite series. The probability that Alice wins on her first turn is 1/2. The probability that the game continues past both Alice and Bob without anyone winning is (1/2)*(1/2) = 1/4. Then, in the next round, Alice has another 1/2 chance to win, so the probability she wins on the second round is (1/4)*(1/2) = 1/8. Then, the third round would be (1/4)^2*(1/2) = 1/32, and so on.

So, the total probability P is the sum of the infinite geometric series:

<prompt_3.2> Calculate the probability that Alice wins the game using an infinite geometric series based on the above plan. </prompt_3.2>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
If Alice has a 1/2 chance to win immediately, and then a 1/4 chance that the game comes back to her with the same probability P of winning, then yes, that equation makes sense. So, solving for P:

P = 1/2 + (1/4)P

Subtract (1/4)P from both sides:

P - (1/4)P = 1/2

(3/4)P = 1/2

Multiply both sides by (4/3):

P = (1/2)*(4/3) = 2/3

So, the probability that Alice wins is 2/3.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
P = 1/2 + (1/4)*(1/2) + (1/4)^2*(1/2) + (1/4)^3*(1/2) + ... 

This is a geometric series where the first term a = 1/2 and the common ratio r = 1/4. The sum of an infinite geometric series is a / (1 - r). So:

P = (1/2) / (1 - 1/4) = (1/2) / (3/4) = (1/2)*(4/3) = 2/3

Based on execution_3.1:
Let me verify this another way to make sure.

<prompt_4.1> Verify the probability that Alice wins the game using a different approach based on the above plan. </prompt_4.1>

Based on execution_3.2:
Hmm, so both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.

<prompt_4.2> Reflect on the solution and confirm the probability that Alice wins the game based on the above plan. </prompt_4.2>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
Another way to think about it: The game can be seen as rounds. In each round, Alice has a 1/2 chance to win. If she doesn't, Bob has a 1/2 chance to win. If neither wins, the round repeats. So, the probability that Alice wins in the first round is 1/2. The probability that the game goes to the next round (both didn't win) is (1/2)*(1/2) = 1/4. Then, in the second round, the probability Alice wins is again 1/2, so the total for the second round is 1/4 * 1/2 = 1/8. Similarly, third round would be (1/4)^2 * 1/2 = 1/32, etc. So, adding up all these probabilities:

1/2 + 1/8 + 1/32 + ... 

This is a geometric series with first term a = 1/2 and ratio r = 1/4. The sum is a / (1 - r) = (1/2) / (1 - 1/4) = (1/2) / (3/4) = 2/3.
</execution_4.1>

<execution_4.2>
Let me think if there's another way to model this. Maybe using states.

The game can be in different states: Alice's turn or Bob's turn. Let's denote P_A as the probability Alice wins when it's her turn, and P_B as the probability Alice wins when it's Bob's turn. Initially, the game is in state P_A.

So, P_A = probability Alice wins on her turn + probability the game transitions to Bob's turn and Alice wins from there.

Which is:

P_A = (1/2) + (1/2)*P_B

Similarly, when it's Bob's turn, Bob can win with probability 1/2, which would make Alice lose, or pass back to Alice with probability 1/2. So, the probability Alice wins from Bob's turn is:

P_B = (1/2)*0 + (1/2)*P_A = (1/2)*P_A

Because if Bob wins, Alice's probability is 0, and if Bob doesn't win, it goes back to Alice's turn with probability P_A.

So, substituting P_B into the equation for P_A:

P_A = (1/2) + (1/2)*(1/2)*P_A

Simplify:

P_A = 1/2 + (1/4)P_A

Which is the same equation as before. So, solving:

P_A - (1/4)P_A = 1/2

(3/4)P_A = 1/2

P_A = (1/2)*(4/3) = 2/3

Same result again.

Based on execution_4.2:
Therefore, after considering multiple approaches—recursive equations, infinite series, and state transitions—the probability that Alice wins the game is consistently 2/3.
I think that's solid. No contradictions in the results, and all methods converge to the same answer.

Therefore, the probability that Alice wins the game is $\boxed{\frac{2}{3}}$.
