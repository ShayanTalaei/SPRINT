Okay, so I need to find the value of tan A in a right triangle ABC where angle B is 90 degrees, and it's given that sin A is equal to 2 cos A. Hmm, let me start by recalling some basic trigonometric relationships in right triangles.

First, in a right triangle, the sine of an angle is equal to the opposite side over the hypotenuse, cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse, and tangent is opposite over adjacent. Since angle B is the right angle, angles A and C must be the other two acute angles. Let me sketch a quick mental picture: triangle ABC with right angle at B, so sides opposite angles A, B, and C are a, b, and c respectively.

<prompt_1.1> Sketch a mental picture of triangle ABC with the right angle at B and label the sides opposite the angles. </prompt_1.1>

Given that sin A = 2 cos A. Let me write that down using the definitions.

sin A = opposite / hypotenuse = BC / AC (since opposite angle A is BC)
cos A = adjacent / hypotenuse = AB / AC (adjacent angle A is AB)

So according to the problem, BC / AC = 2 * (AB / AC). Wait, since both have the same hypotenuse AC, maybe I can simplify this equation.
Multiply both sides by AC to get rid of the denominators.

<prompt_1.2> Simplify the equation BC / AC = 2 * (AB / AC) by multiplying both sides by AC. </prompt_1.2>

But maybe I should approach this using trigonometric identities instead of the triangle sides to see if I reach the same conclusion. Let's try that.

<prompt_1.3> Use trigonometric identities to solve sin A = 2 cos A and find tan A. </prompt_1.3>

Alternatively, since tan A = sin A / cos A, and we have sin A = 2 cos A, then tan A = (2 cos A) / cos A = 2.
That's a quicker way. So maybe there's a step here.

<prompt_1.4> Explore alternative methods to solve for tan A directly from sin A = 2 cos A. </prompt_1.4>

But let me confirm this with the triangle approach. If tan A = 2, that means in a right triangle, the opposite side is 2 and adjacent is 1, so hypotenuse is sqrt(1 + 4) = sqrt(5).
Then sin A = 2 / sqrt(5), cos A = 1 / sqrt(5), so sin A / cos A = 2, which is tan A. So that's consistent.

Wait, no, actually, in standard notation, angle A is opposite side a, angle B opposite side b, and angle C opposite side c. But since angle B is the right angle, then side b is the hypotenuse. So sides a and c are the legs, with a opposite angle A and c opposite angle C. Got it.

That would give BC = 2 AB. So the length of side BC (opposite angle A) is twice the length of AB (adjacent angle A). Interesting.

So if I let AB = x, then BC = 2x. Then, using the Pythagorean theorem, AC² = AB² + BC² = x² + (2x)² = x² + 4x² = 5x². Therefore, AC = x√5.

Given sin A = 2 cos A. Let's divide both sides by cos A (assuming cos A ≠ 0, which it can't be in a right triangle because angle A is acute, so cos A is positive). Then we get tan A = 2. Wait, that's the same result as before. So tan A is 2.
</execution_1.3>

<execution_1.4>
Let me see. If I divide both sides of sin A = 2 cos A by cos A, assuming cos A ≠ 0, which it can't be in a right triangle because angle A is acute, so cos A is positive. Then sin A / cos A = 2, which is tan A = 2. So that's direct.

Based on execution_1.2:
Now, tan A is opposite over adjacent, which is BC / AB. BC is 2x, AB is x, so tan A = 2x / x = 2.
Therefore, tan A is 2.

Wait, that seems straightforward. But let me verify again to make sure I didn't skip any steps.

<prompt_2.1> Verify the result obtained from the triangle sides to ensure no steps were skipped. </prompt_2.1>

Starting with sin A = 2 cos A. Expressed in terms of the sides, that's (BC / AC) = 2*(AB / AC). The AC cancels out, leading to BC = 2 AB. Then using Pythagoras, AC is sqrt(AB² + BC²) = sqrt(x² + (2x)^2) = sqrt(5x²) = x√5. Then tan A is BC / AB = 2x / x = 2.

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Alternatively, using trigonometric identities, if sin A = 2 cos A, then dividing both sides by cos A gives tan A = 2. So both methods confirm that tan A is 2.
Therefore, the answer should be 2.

But let me just think again if there's any possibility of a mistake. For instance, could there be a case where sin A = 2 cos A but tan A isn't 2? Let's see.

<prompt_3.1> Consider if there could be a case where sin A = 2 cos A but tan A isn't 2. </prompt_3.1>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
If sin A = 2 cos A, then tan A = sin A / cos A = 2. So regardless of the angle, as long as cos A isn't zero, which it can't be in a right triangle, tan A must be 2. So that's straightforward.

<Final_answer>
Therefore, $\tan A = \boxed{2}$.
