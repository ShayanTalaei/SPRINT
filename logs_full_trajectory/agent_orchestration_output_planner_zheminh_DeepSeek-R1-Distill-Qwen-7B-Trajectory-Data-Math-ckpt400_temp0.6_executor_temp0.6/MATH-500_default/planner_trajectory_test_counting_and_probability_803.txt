Okay, so I need to find the probability that x + y ≤ 4 when a point (x, y) is randomly selected from the region where 0 ≤ x ≤ 8 and 0 ≤ y ≤ 4. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, probability problems like this usually involve comparing the area where the condition is satisfied to the total possible area. Since the point is selected randomly, the probability should be the ratio of the favorable area to the total area.

Let me confirm that. The total area where the point can be selected is a rectangle with length 8 (along the x-axis) and height 4 (along the y-axis). So the total area is 8 * 4 = 32.

Now, the condition is x + y ≤ 4. That's a linear inequality, so it should represent a region in the plane. Specifically, it's the area below the line x + y = 4. Let me visualize this.

<prompt_1.1> Visualize the region defined by the inequality x + y ≤ 4 within the coordinate plane. </prompt_1.1>

But let me verify this again to be sure. Maybe I made a mistake in the shape of the region.

<prompt_1.2> Re-evaluate the region defined by x + y ≤ 4 and verify the area calculation. </prompt_1.2>

But wait, let me check if the line x + y = 4 intersects the boundaries of the rectangle in any other points.

<prompt_1.3> Check if the line x + y = 4 intersects the boundaries of the rectangle and confirm the intersection points. </prompt_1.3>

<execution_1.1>
The line x + y = 4 would pass through points (4, 0) and (0, 4). But wait, our rectangle goes from x = 0 to x = 8 and y = 0 to y = 4. So the line x + y = 4 would intersect the rectangle at (4, 0) and (0, 4). But since the rectangle's x goes up to 8, but the line x + y = 4 only reaches x = 4 when y = 0. So the region where x + y ≤ 4 within the rectangle is a triangle with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 4), and (4, 0).
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
The line x + y = 4 intersects the x-axis at (4, 0) and the y-axis at (0, 4). So in the coordinate system from (0,0) to (8,0) and up to (0,4), the line connects (0,4) to (4,0). So the region where x + y ≤ 4 is a triangle with vertices at (0,0), (0,4), and (4,0). Wait, is that right? Let me plot these points.

Yes, if you connect (0,4) to (4,0), that's the line x + y = 4. So the area below that line in the first quadrant is a triangle. The area of this triangle is (base * height)/2. The base along the y-axis is 4, and the height along the x-axis is 4 (from x=0 to x=4). So area is (4 * 4)/2 = 16/2 = 8.
</execution_1.2>

<execution_1.3>
The line x + y = 4. When x=0, y=4, which is the top-left corner of the rectangle. When y=0, x=4, which is (4,0). So yes, the line connects (0,4) to (4,0). So the region x + y ≤ 4 within the rectangle is a triangle with vertices at (0,0), (0,4), and (4,0).
</execution_1.3>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Wait, is that right?
Let me think again. If x is between 0 and 4, then when y is 0, x can be up to 4. But if x is greater than 4, say x = 5, then y would have to be negative to satisfy x + y ≤ 4, but y can't be negative. So actually, the region where x + y ≤ 4 is only where x is from 0 to 4, and for each x, y is from 0 to 4 - x.
So the area should be the integral from x = 0 to x = 4 of (4 - x) dx. Let's compute that. The integral of 4 dx from 0 to 4 is 4x evaluated from 0 to 4, which is 16. The integral of x dx from 0 to 4 is (1/2)x² evaluated from 0 to 4, which is 8. So the total area is 16 - 8 = 8. So the area where x + y ≤ 4 is 8.

Based on execution_1.2:
However, the total area is 8*4=32. Therefore, the probability is 8/32 = 1/4.
Wait, but I need to make sure that the entire region x + y ≤ 4 is within the rectangle.

<prompt_2.1> Calculate the probability by dividing the area of the region where x + y ≤ 4 by the total area. </prompt_2.1>

Based on execution_1.3:
So the favorable area is a triangle with area 8, and the total area is 32, so probability is 8/32 = 1/4. That seems correct.

Wait, but let me think again. If x can go up to 8, but the condition x + y ≤ 4 only applies when x is up to 4. So for x from 4 to 8, there's no possible y (since y has to be at least 0) that would satisfy x + y ≤ 4. So indeed, the region is only from x=0 to x=4, and for each x in that interval, y goes from 0 to 4 - x. So the area is the integral from 0 to 4 of (4 - x) dx, which is 8, as calculated.

Alternatively, without calculus, the area is a right triangle with legs of length 4.

<prompt_2.2> Verify the area calculation using the right triangle method. </prompt_2.2>

Based on execution_1.1:
So the answer is 1/4. Hmm. Wait, but I need to check if the point is selected from the entire rectangle, so even though the line x + y =4 is within the rectangle from x=0 to x=4, the rest of the rectangle from x=4 to x=8 is entirely excluded from the favorable region.

<prompt_2.3> Confirm the probability calculation by considering the entire rectangle and the favorable region. </prompt_2.3>

Based on execution_1.2, execution_1.3:
But just to make sure, let's imagine the rectangle. The rectangle is 8 units long on the x-axis and 4 units on the y-axis. The line x + y = 4 cuts through the top left corner at (0,4) and the bottom right at (4,0). So the area under this line is a triangle with vertices at (0,0), (0,4), and (4,0).

<prompt_2.4> Perform a final verification of the solution using the triangle vertices method. </prompt_2.4>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Since the rectangle goes up to x=8, but the line x + y =4 only goes up to x=4 when y=0, so yes, the region x + y ≤4 is entirely within the rectangle for x from 0 to 4, and y from 0 to 4 -x. So the area is 8, as calculated. Therefore, the probability is 8/32 = 1/4.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
So area is (4*4)/2 = 8. Yep, same as before.

Therefore, the probability is 8/32 = 1/4.
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
Therefore, the probability is indeed 8/32=1/4.

But let me check once more. Suppose I use geometry. The region x + y ≤4 is a triangle with vertices at (0,0), (0,4), and (4,0). The area of this triangle is (base * height)/2. The base is 4 (from (0,0) to (0,4)), and the height is also 4 (from (0,0) to (4,0)). So area is (4*4)/2=8. Total area is 8*4=32. So 8/32=1/4.
</execution_2.3>

<execution_2.4>
The area of this triangle is (4*4)/2 = 8. The area of the rectangle is 8*4=32. So 8/32 = 1/4. Yep, that's correct. So the probability is 1/4.

Wait a second, but sometimes when dealing with geometry probability, you have to be careful about the region. Let me confirm once more. If x is between 0 and 4, and y between 0 and 4 - x, then that's the triangle. If x is between 4 and 8, there's no y that satisfies the condition because y would have to be negative. So yes, the favorable area is just that triangle. So 8/32 reduces to 1/4.

I think that's the answer. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning. Both methods—integration and geometric area—give the same result.
