<Question>
Recently, Frank took a one-hundred question aptitude test where each correct answer scored $5$ points, each incorrect answer scored $-2$ points, and each question not answered scored zero points. Frank answered $80$ questions and scored $232$ points. How many questions did he answer correctly?

Okay, let's try to figure out how many questions Frank answered correctly on his aptitude test. Hmm, so there are 100 questions total. He answered 80 of them, which means he left 20 unanswered. Each correct answer gives 5 points, each incorrect one deducts 2 points, and unanswered questions give nothing. His total score is 232 points. We need to find out how many he got right.

First, let me break down the information. Total questions: 100. He answered 80, so 20 are blank. Let's denote the number of correct answers as 'c' and the number of incorrect answers as 'i'. Since he answered 80 questions, the sum of correct and incorrect should be 80. So, c + i = 80. That's equation one.

Now, the scoring system. Each correct answer is 5 points, so total points from correct answers would be 5c. Each incorrect answer is -2 points, so total points lost from incorrect answers would be -2i. The total score is the sum of these two, which equals 232. So, 5c - 2i = 232. That's equation two.

We have a system of two equations:
1. c + i = 80
2. 5c - 2i = 232

We can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let's try substitution. From equation one, we can express i in terms of c: i = 80 - c. Then substitute this into equation two.

But let me think again if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe to confirm. For example, suppose all 80 answered questions were correct.

<prompt_1.2> Explore an alternative method by assuming all answered questions were correct and adjust from there. </prompt_1.2>

Alternatively, using elimination. Multiply equation one by 2 to make the coefficients of i's opposites.

So, substituting into equation two: 5c - 2(80 - c) = 232. Let's work that out. First, distribute the -2: 5c - 160 + 2c = 232. Combine like terms: 5c + 2c = 7c, so 7c - 160 = 232. Then, add 160 to both sides: 7c = 232 + 160. Let's compute 232 + 160. 232 + 160 is 392. So, 7c = 392. Divide both sides by 7: c = 392 / 7. Let me calculate that. 7 goes into 392: 7*50=350, 392-350=42. 7*6=42. So, 50+6=56. Therefore, c=56.

<execution_1.2>
Then the score would be 80*5=400. But he scored 232, which is way less. So, the difference is 400 - 232 = 168 points lost. Each incorrect answer instead of correct would cost 5 + 2 = 7 points (since you lose 5 and also get -2 instead of 0). Wait, maybe not exactly. Let's see.

Alternatively, each incorrect answer instead of correct would result in a loss of 5 + 2 = 7 points compared to if it were correct. Because a correct gives +5, incorrect gives -2, so the difference is 5 - (-2) = 7. So if he had all correct, 400, and he actually has 232, the total difference is 400 - 232 = 168. So the number of incorrect answers would be 168 / 7 = 24. Therefore, incorrect answers are 24, so correct are 80 -24=56.

<execution_1.3>
Wait, equation one multiplied by 2: 2c + 2i = 160. Then subtract this from equation two adjusted somehow. Wait, equation two is 5c -2i =232. If we add equation one multiplied by 2 to equation two, let's see:

2c + 2i = 160

+ 

5c -2i =232

Adding these equations: (2c +5c) + (2i -2i) = 160 +232 →7c +0=392 →7c=392 →c=56. Same result. So that's another way.

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Then the number of incorrect answers would be 80 - c = 80 - 56 = 24. Let's check if this works with the total score.

<prompt_2.1> Verify the solution by checking if the calculated number of correct and incorrect answers matches the total score. </prompt_2.1>

Based on execution_1.2:
Hmm, that seems a quicker way. So, the concept is that for each incorrect answer instead of correct, you lose 7 points.

<prompt_2.2> Explain the alternative method and confirm the solution using both methods. </prompt_2.2>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
56 correct answers give 56*5 = 280 points. 24 incorrect answers give 24*(-2) = -48 points. Total score: 280 - 48 = 232.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
So total points lost is 168, so 168 /7=24 incorrect. Hence, correct is 56.

But either way, the answer is 56.

</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Wait, let me double-check. If he answered 56 correctly and 24 incorrectly, that's 56 +24 =80 answered. 20 blank. The score calculation: 56*5=280, 24*(-2)=-48.
280 -48=232.

But let me just make sure there are no other possible solutions or constraints.

<prompt_3.1> Verify the number of unanswered questions and ensure all constraints are satisfied. </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
The problem states he answered 80, so 20 blank. We didn't use that information except to note that unanswered give zero. But in our equations, we only considered the answered ones. So, since we accounted for all 80 answered as c + i, and the score from those, then the 20 blanks contribute nothing. So, that's okay. 

Also, all numbers are non-negative: 56,24,20. No negatives. So that's valid.

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
I think that's solid.
So the answer is 56.

No prompt to execute.

<Final_answer>
Therefore, Frank answered $\boxed{56}$ questions correctly.
