What integer $n$ satisfies $0\le n<18$ and $$n\equiv -11213141\pmod{18}~?$$
</Question>

<think>
<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to find an integer n such that 0 ≤ n < 18 and n is congruent to -11213141 modulo 18. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. 

First, I remember that when dealing with congruences modulo 18, it's often helpful to find the remainder when the number is divided by 18. But here, the number is negative, so I need to be careful. Wait, the original number is -11213141. So, I need to compute -11213141 mod 18. Alternatively, since congruence modulo 18 means that two numbers are equivalent if their difference is a multiple of 18, I can add multiples of 18 to -11213141 until I get a number in the range 0 to 17.

But adding 18 repeatedly to a negative number might take a long time, especially such a large number as 11213141. There must be a smarter way. Maybe I can find the modulus of the absolute value first and then adjust for the negative sign. Let me recall that for any integer a, a mod m is equivalent to (-a) mod m being equal to m - (a mod m), provided a is not a multiple of m.
So perhaps I can first compute 11213141 mod 18, and then subtract that from 18 to get the equivalent positive modulus for the negative number.

Alternatively, another method is to use the division algorithm: divide -11213141 by 18 and find the remainder. But division with negative numbers can be tricky. Let me confirm the approach.

First, let me compute 11213141 mod 18.

To compute this, I can use the property that the modulus of a number with respect to 18 is the same as the sum of its digits multiplied by their respective place values mod 18. Wait, but that might not be straightforward. Alternatively, I can break down 18 into its prime factors: 18 = 2 * 3^2. So, by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, computing modulo 18 is equivalent to computing modulo 2 and modulo 9, then combining the results. Maybe that's easier?

Wait, but since 18 is small, perhaps there's a shortcut. For modulus 18, there's a trick where you can sum the digits in a certain way. Let me recall: For modulus 9, the standard trick is that the sum of the digits mod 9 is equivalent to the number mod 9. But for modulus 18, since 18 is 2*9, and 2 and 9 are coprime, maybe we can use a similar digit sum approach but adjusted for modulus 18.

Alternatively, perhaps compute the number mod 2 and mod 9 separately, then use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to find the result mod 18. Let me try that approach.

Based on execution_1.1:
First, compute 11213141 mod 2.

<prompt_2.1> Compute 11213141 mod 2. </prompt_2.1>

Now, compute 11213141 mod 9. For modulus 9, sum the digits:

<prompt_2.2> Compute 11213141 mod 9 by summing its digits. </prompt_2.2>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Since any even number mod 2 is 0 and any odd number is 1. 11213141 ends with a 1, which is odd, so 11213141 mod 2 is 1. Therefore, -11213141 mod 2 is also 1, because -1 mod 2 is 1. So, n ≡ 1 mod 2.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 4 + 1 = Let's compute step by step:

1 + 1 = 2

2 + 2 = 4

4 + 1 = 5

5 + 3 = 8

8 + 1 = 9

9 + 4 = 13

13 + 1 = 14

So the sum of the digits is 14. Then 14 mod 9 is 14 - 9 = 5. Therefore, 11213141 ≡ 5 mod 9.
</execution_2.2>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1, execution_2.2:
Therefore, -11213141 ≡ -5 mod 9. To find this mod 9, compute -5 + 9 = 4.
So, -11213141 ≡ 4 mod 9.

Now, combining the two congruences: n ≡ 1 mod 2 and n ≡ 4 mod 9. We need to find a number n between 0 and 17 that satisfies both.

<prompt_3.1> Find a number n between 0 and 17 that satisfies n ≡ 1 mod 2 and n ≡ 4 mod 9. </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
Let's list numbers congruent to 4 mod 9: 4, 13, 22, 31, ... But since we need n < 18, the candidates are 4 and 13. Now check which of these are ≡1 mod 2. 4 is even (0 mod 2), 13 is odd (1 mod 2). Therefore, 13 is the solution. So n = 13.

</Execution_3>

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
Wait, but let me verify this because sometimes I might make a mistake in the Chinese Remainder Theorem steps. Let me check if 13 mod 2 is 1 and 13 mod 9 is 4.

<prompt_4.1> Verify that n = 13 satisfies both mod 2 and mod 9 conditions. </prompt_4.1>

But let me cross-verify by another method to be sure. Let's compute -11213141 mod 18 directly.

<prompt_4.2> Cross-verify the result by computing -11213141 mod 18 directly. </prompt_4.2>

But just to make sure, let's try another approach. Let's compute the modulus of 11213141 first. Since modulus is linear, -11213141 mod 18 = (-1)*(11213141 mod 18) mod 18.

<prompt_4.3> Verify the result using another approach by computing the modulus of 11213141 and adjusting for the negative sign. </prompt_4.3>

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that 10 ≡ 10 mod 18, 10^2 ≡ 10*10=100≡100-5*18=100-90=10 mod 18. Wait, 10^2 ≡ 10 mod 18? Let me check:

<prompt_4.4> Verify the result using exponentiation to compute 10^k mod 18. </prompt_4.4>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
Yes, correct. So 13 is the answer.
</execution_4.1>

<execution_4.2>
To do this, we can add multiples of 18 to -11213141 until we get a positive number in the range 0-17. However, since 11213141 is a large number, adding 18 once would give -11213141 + 18 = -11213123. Still negative. Continue this process... this is impractical. Instead, let's compute 11213141 mod 18 first, then negate it and adjust.

Compute 11213141 mod 18. Since 18 = 2*9, and as before, perhaps compute mod 2 and mod 9. But we already did that for the original number. Wait, 11213141 mod 2 is 1, mod 9 is 5. Then, combining gives 11213141 ≡ 11 mod 18? Wait, let's check. Wait, earlier when we did Chinese Remainder Theorem for 11213141, we found n ≡1 mod2 and n≡5 mod9. So solving those gives 11 mod18. Let me confirm:

Find x ≡1 mod2 and x≡5 mod9. Let x=9k +5. Then 9k +5 ≡1 mod2. 9k is congruent to k mod2, so k +5 ≡1 mod2. 5 is 1 mod2, so k +1 ≡1 mod2 => k≡0 mod2. Therefore, k=2m, so x=9*(2m)+5=18m +5. Therefore, the smallest positive solution is 5, then 23, etc. Wait, but 5 mod2 is 1, 5 mod9 is 5. So 11213141 ≡5 mod18. Therefore, -11213141 ≡-5 mod18. Then, -5 mod18 is 13. So yes, that's the same result as before. Therefore, n=13.
</execution_4.2>

<execution_4.3>
Earlier, we found that 11213141 mod 9 is 5, so 11213141 mod 18 must be 5 mod 18? Wait, no. Wait, 11213141 mod 18: since 18 is 2*9, and we found 11213141 mod 2 =1 and mod 9=5. So by Chinese Remainder Theorem, find x ≡1 mod 2 and x≡5 mod 9. Let's solve this.

Looking for x ≡5 mod 9. Possible residues mod 18 are 5 and 14 (since 5 +9=14). Check which is 1 mod 2. 5 is odd (1 mod 2), 14 is even (0 mod 2). So x=5 mod 18. Therefore, 11213141 ≡5 mod 18. Therefore, -11213141 ≡ -5 mod 18. Then, -5 mod 18 is 13, since 18-5=13. Therefore, n=13.
</execution_4.3>

<execution_4.4>
10^2 = 100. 100 divided by 18 is 5*18=90, remainder 10. Yes, 10^2 ≡ 10 mod 18. Interesting. Then 10^3 ≡ 10*10=100≡10 mod 18, so 10^3 ≡10 mod 18. Similarly, 10^k ≡10 mod 18 for k ≥1? Wait, 10^1≡10, 10^2≡10, 10^3≡10, etc. So, if that's the case, then each digit multiplied by 10^k would be equivalent to digit*10 mod 18. Therefore, the entire number's modulus can be computed by summing each digit multiplied by 10, then mod 18.

Wait, let's test this. Let's take a number, say 1234. Then 1234 mod 18. Let's compute 1234 / 18. 18*68=1224, so 1234-1224=10. So 1234≡10 mod 18. Alternatively, using the digit method: sum each digit times 10^position. Wait, but maybe the method is different. Let me see.

Alternatively, 1234 in digits is 1,2,3,4. If we compute (1*10^3 + 2*10^2 + 3*10 +4) mod 18. Since 10^1≡10, 10^2≡10, 10^3≡10 mod 18. Therefore, each term is digit *10. So:

1*10 + 2*10 +3*10 +4*1 = (1+2+3)*10 +4 =6*10 +4=60 +4=64. 64 mod 18: 18*3=54, 64-54=10. So 10 mod 18. Which matches. So yes, for numbers with multiple digits, if each power of 10 is congruent to 10 mod 18, then the modulus can be computed as the sum of each digit multiplied by 10, then mod 18.

Therefore, for the number 11213141, let's list the digits from left to right: 1,1,2,1,3,1,4,1. So positions (from right to left) but since each digit is multiplied by 10^k, which is 10 mod 18 regardless of k. So each digit is multiplied by 10. Therefore, the total sum would be (sum of digits)*10 mod 18.

Wait, let's check:



Therefore, applying this to 11213141:

Based on execution_4.4:
Sum of digits: 1+1+2+1+3+1+4+1=14. Then 14*10=140. 140 mod 18: 18*7=126, 140-126=14. So 14 mod 18. Therefore, 11213141 ≡14 mod 18. Wait, but earlier using Chinese Remainder Theorem, we found it was 5 mod 18. There's a contradiction here.

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
Hmm, this is a problem. Which one is correct?

Wait, let's check with another method. Let's compute 11213141 divided by 18. Let's see:

First, 18*600,000=10,800,000. 11213141 -10,800,000=413,141.

18*20,000=360,000. 413,141 -360,000=53,141.

18*2,000=36,000. 53,141 -36,000=17,141.

18*900=16,200. 17,141 -16,200=941.

18*52=936. 941 -936=5.

So total is 600,000 +20,000 +2,000 +900 +52=622,952. Remainder 5. Therefore, 11213141=18*622,952 +5, so indeed 11213141≡5 mod 18. Therefore, the previous digit method giving 14 is incorrect. So where is the mistake?

Ah, I see. The mistake is in the assumption that 10^k ≡10 mod 18 for all k≥1. Let's check 10^1=10≡10 mod18. 10^2=100≡100-5*18=100-90=10 mod18. 10^3=10*10^2≡10*10=100≡10 mod18. So indeed, 10^k≡10 mod18 for any k≥1. Therefore, each digit (except the first one) is multiplied by 10. Wait, but in the number 11213141, the digits are:

From left to right: positions 8 to 1 (if we consider the leftmost digit as position 8, but actually, in standard digit positions, the rightmost is units, then tens, etc. ). Wait, perhaps the confusion is about the position of the digits. Let me clarify:

For the number 11213141, the digits are:

Position (from right): 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

Digits:                 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1

Wait, no. Wait, the rightmost digit is position 1 (units), then tens is position 2, etc. So the number 11213141 is:

Digits (from left to right): 1 (position 8), 1 (position 7), 2 (position 6), 1 (position 5), 3 (position 4), 1 (position 3), 4 (position 2), 1 (position 1).

Therefore, when considering the value of each digit, the leftmost digit (position 8) is 1*10^7, the next is 1*10^6, etc. , down to 1*10^0.

Therefore, each digit's contribution is digit *10^(position-1). So for position 8: 1*10^7, position 7:1*10^6, etc.

But since 10^k ≡10 mod18 for any k≥1, as we saw earlier, because 10^1≡10, 10^2≡10*10=100≡10, and so on. Therefore, 10^k≡10 mod18 for all k≥1.

Therefore, each digit multiplied by 10^k where k≥1 is equivalent to digit*10 mod18. However, the leftmost digit is 1*10^7, which is 1*10 mod18=10. The next digit is 1*10^6=1*10=10, and so on, until the last digit, which is 1*10^0=1.

Therefore, the total modulus would be:

(1*10 + 1*10 + 2*10 +1*10 +3*10 +1*10 +4*10 +1) mod18.

Let's compute this:

First, sum all the digits except the last one multiplied by 10:

(1+1+2+1+3+1+4)*10 +1.

Sum inside the parentheses: 1+1=2, +2=4, +1=5, +3=8, +1=9, +4=13. So 13*10=130. Then add the last digit 1: 130 +1=131.

Now, 131 mod18: 18*7=126, 131-126=5. So 131≡5 mod18. Therefore, this matches the previous result. So the mistake earlier was not accounting for the fact that even the higher digits (except the last one) are multiplied by 10^k≡10 mod18, but the leftmost digit (position 8) is 1*10^7≡1*10 mod18=10, then the next digit (position7) is 1*10^6≡1*10 mod18=10, etc. , up to position2:4*10^1≡4*10=40≡40-2*18=40-36=4 mod18. Wait, hold on, this seems conflicting with previous.

Wait, no. Wait, actually, each digit is multiplied by 10^(position-1). For example, the leftmost digit (position8) is 1*10^7. Since 10^7≡10 mod18, so 1*10^7≡10 mod18. Similarly, the next digit (position7) is 1*10^6≡10 mod18, and so on. The digit in position2 is 4*10^1≡4*10=40≡40-2*18=4 mod18. The digit in position1 is 1*10^0=1.

Therefore, the total sum is:

(1*10^7 +1*10^6 +2*10^5 +1*10^4 +3*10^3 +1*10^2 +4*10^1 +1*10^0) mod18

≡ (1*10 +1*10 +2*10 +1*10 +3*10 +1*10 +4*10 +1) mod18

Wait, no. Wait, 10^7≡10, 10^6≡10, 10^5≡10, etc. , down to 10^1≡10. So:

≡ (1*10 +1*10 +2*10 +1*10 +3*10 +1*10 +4*10 +1) mod18

Now, compute each term:

1*10=10

1*10=10

2*10=20

1*10=10

3*10=30

1*10=10

4*10=40

1=1

Add them all up:

10+10=20

20+20=40

40+10=50

50+30=80

80+10=90

90+40=130

130+1=131

131 mod18: 18*7=126, 131-126=5. So 5 mod18. Correct. Therefore, this method also gives 5. Then, -5 mod18=13. Therefore, n=13.

<Execution_6>
<execution_6.1>
Wait, I computed the sum of digits as 14, then multiplied by 10, getting 140≡14 mod18. But that's incorrect because the digit positions affect the power of 10. So the digit-by-digit method where each digit is multiplied by 10^k where k is the position-1 is more accurate, but since for k≥1, 10^k≡10 mod18, except for the last digit which is 10^0=1. Therefore, the correct approach is to handle each digit's position correctly.

Therefore, the initial mistake was in the digit-by-digit sum where I didn't account for the correct powers of 10. Instead, by recognizing that all digits except the last one are multiplied by 10^k≡10 mod18, we can compute the total sum correctly. Therefore, the correct modulus is indeed 5, leading to n=13.

Then 11213154 divided by18: 18*622,952=11,213,136. 11,213,154 -11,213,136=18. So 11,213,154=18*(622,952 +1)=18*622,953. Therefore, yes, 11213154 is divisible by18. Therefore, 11213141 ≡-11213154 mod18≡-13 mod18≡5 mod18. Hence, correct.

Therefore, after thorough checking, the answer is 13.
