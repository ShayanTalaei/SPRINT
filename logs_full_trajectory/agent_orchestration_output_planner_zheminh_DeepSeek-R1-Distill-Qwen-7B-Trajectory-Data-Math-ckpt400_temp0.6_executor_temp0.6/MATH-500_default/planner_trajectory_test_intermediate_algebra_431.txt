Okay, let's see. I need to factor the expression ab + 5b + 2a + 10. Hmm, factoring expressions can sometimes be tricky, but maybe I can group terms together or look for common factors.

<prompt_1.1> Identify potential common factors in the expression ab + 5b + 2a + 10. </prompt_1.1>

Let me write down the expression again to visualize it better: ab + 5b + 2a + 10. 

First, I notice that there are four terms. Sometimes, factoring by grouping works when you have four terms. The idea is to group them into pairs and factor each pair separately. Let me try that.

Based on execution_1.1:
Looking at the first two terms, ab and 5b, I see that both have a 'b' in them. So maybe I can factor out a 'b' from the first two terms.
Let's try that: b(a + 5).

Now, the last two terms are 2a and 10. Hmm, both of these have a '2' in common. If I factor out a '2' from the last two terms, I get 2(a + 5).

Let me check: 2*(a) is 2a, and 2*5 is 10. Yep, that works.

So now, after grouping, the expression becomes b(a + 5) + 2(a + 5).
Wait a minute, both terms now have (a + 5) as a common factor. That's interesting. So maybe I can factor out (a + 5) from both terms.

<prompt_2.1> Factor out the common term (a + 5) from the expression b(a + 5) + 2(a + 5). </prompt_2.1>

Let me verify to make sure I didn't make a mistake. If I expand (b + 2)(a + 5), do I get back the original expression?

<prompt_2.2> Expand (b + 2)(a + 5) to verify if it matches the original expression ab + 5b + 2a + 10. </prompt_2.2>

Wait, but let me double-check my steps to ensure I didn't skip anything. 

Original expression: ab + 5b + 2a + 10. Grouped into (ab + 5b) + (2a + 10).
Factored first group: b(a + 5). Second group: 2(a + 5). Then combined as (b + 2)(a + 5).

But maybe there's another way to group the terms? Let me try a different grouping to see if I get the same result. 

Alternative grouping: ab + 2a + 5b + 10. Maybe group ab + 2a and 5b + 10.

<prompt_2.3> Try a different grouping of terms to factor the expression ab + 5b + 2a + 10. </prompt_2.3>

Another way to think about it might be to use the method of factoring by grouping, but perhaps rearranging terms first. Let me see.

<prompt_2.4> Rearrange the terms and factor the expression ab + 5b + 2a + 10 using a different grouping method. </prompt_2.4>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
So factoring out (a + 5), we get (a + 5)(b + 2). Let me write that down.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
First, multiply (b + 2) with (a + 5). Using the distributive property: b*a + b*5 + 2*a + 2*5 = ab + 5b + 2a + 10.
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
Factoring ab + 2a gives a(b + 2). Then, 5b + 10 can be factored as 5(b + 2). So that would give a(b + 2) + 5(b + 2), which factors to (a + 5)(b + 2). Wait, that's the same result as before, just written as (a + 5)(b + 2) instead of (b + 2)(a + 5). Since multiplication is commutative, the order doesn't matter, so both are correct.
</execution_2.3>

<execution_2.4>
Alternatively, maybe factor out an 'a' from the first and third terms? Let's see: ab + 2a is a(b + 2). Then 5b + 10 is 5(b + 2). So then we have a(b + 2) + 5(b + 2), which factors to (a + 5)(b + 2).
</execution_2.4>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Alternatively, I could have grouped the terms differently in the beginning. Let me try grouping ab with 2a and 5b with 10. Wait, but that might complicate things.
Let's see: ab + 2a is a(b + 2), and 5b + 10 is 5(b + 2). Then, adding those two results: a(b + 2) + 5(b + 2) = (a + 5)(b + 2). Same result.

Based on execution_2.2, execution_2.3, execution_2.4:
Is there any other way to approach this? Maybe using the distributive property in reverse? Let's see.

<prompt_3.1> Verify the factorization (b + 2)(a + 5) using the distributive property in reverse. </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
If I look for two binomials that multiply to give the original expression. The possible factors would be (ab + something)(something + something). But since the original expression has terms ab, 5b, 2a, 10, it's more systematic to use the grouping method as before.

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
Another check: substitute values for a and b and see if the original expression and the factored form give the same result. Let's pick a = 1 and b = 1.
Original expression: 1*1 + 5*1 + 2*1 + 10 = 1 + 5 + 2 + 10 = 18.

<prompt_4.1> Substitute a = 1 and b = 1 into the original expression and the factored form to verify if they give the same result. </prompt_4.1>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
Factored form: (1 + 2)(1 + 5) = 3*6 = 18. Same result. Let's try another set, say a = 0 and b = 0. Original: 0 + 0 + 0 + 10 = 10. Factored: (0 + 2)(0 + 5) = 2*5 = 10. Correct again. Maybe a negative number? Let a = -1, b = -1. Original: (-1)(-1) + 5*(-1) + 2*(-1) + 10 = 1 -5 -2 +10 = 4. Factored: (-1 +2)(-1 +5) = (1)(4) = 4. Also works.
</execution_4.1>
</Execution_4>

<Final_answer>
Therefore, the factored form of the expression $ab + 5b + 2a + 10$ is $\boxed{(b+2)(a+5)}$.
