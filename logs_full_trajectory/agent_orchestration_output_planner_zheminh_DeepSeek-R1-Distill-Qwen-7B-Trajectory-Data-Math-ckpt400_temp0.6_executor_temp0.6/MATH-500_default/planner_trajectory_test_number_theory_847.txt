Okay, so I need to convert the decimal number 555 into base 5. Hmm, let me remember how to do this. I think the standard method is to divide the number by 5 repeatedly and record the remainders. Then, the base 5 number is the sequence of those remainders read in reverse order. Let me try to work through this step by step.

First, let me start with the number 555. I'll divide it by 5.

<prompt_1.1> Execute the first division of 555 by 5 and find the quotient and remainder. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
So, 555 divided by 5. Well, 5 times 111 is 555, right? So the quotient is 111 and the remainder is 0. Okay, so the first remainder is 0.
</execution_1.1>
</Execution_1>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Now, take the quotient 111 and divide that by 5.

<prompt_2.1> Execute the second division of 111 by 5 and find the new quotient and remainder. </prompt_2.1>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Let me see, 5 times 22 is 110, so the quotient is 22 and the remainder is 1. So the next remainder is 1.
</execution_2.1>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Now take 22 and divide by 5.

<prompt_3.1> Execute the third division of 22 by 5 and find the new quotient and remainder. </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
5 times 4 is 20, so quotient is 4, remainder is 2. So remainder is 2.
</execution_3.1>
</Execution_3>

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
Now take 4 and divide by 5.

<prompt_4.1> Execute the fourth division of 4 by 5 and find the new quotient and remainder. </prompt_4.1>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
5 goes into 4 zero times, so the quotient is 0 and the remainder is 4. So remainder is 4.
</execution_4.1>
</Execution_4>

<Plan_5>
Based on execution_4.1:
Now, since the quotient is 0, we stop here. The remainders we got were 0, 1, 2, 4. But we need to reverse this order to get the base 5 number.

<prompt_5.1> Reverse the order of the remainders obtained and determine the base 5 number. </prompt_5.1>
</Plan_5>

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
So reversing 0, 1, 2, 4 gives 4, 2, 1, 0. Therefore, the base 5 number is 4210 in base 5.
</execution_5.1>
</Execution_5>

<Plan_6>
Based on execution_5.1:
Wait, let me verify that. Let me check by converting 4210 base 5 back to decimal to see if it equals 555.

<prompt_6.1> Verify the conversion by converting 4210 from base 5 back to decimal. </prompt_6.1>

But just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the division steps, let me go through them again.

First division: 555 รท 5.

<prompt_6.2> Recheck the division steps and confirm the conversion result. </prompt_6.2>

Alternatively, maybe I can try another method. Let's see, in base 5, each digit represents a power of 5. So the rightmost digit is 5^0 (1s place), then 5^1 (5s place), 5^2 (25s place), 5^3 (125s place), etc. Let's see, 5^3 is 125. How many times does 125 go into 555?

<prompt_6.3> Use an alternative method to confirm the conversion by considering powers of 5. </prompt_6.3>

I think that's correct. Let me just check once more with the division steps to be absolutely sure. Maybe I made a mistake when dividing 22 by 5.

<prompt_6.4> Recheck the division steps and confirm the conversion result again. </prompt_6.4>
</Plan_6>

<Execution_6>
<execution_6.1>
Starting from the rightmost digit: the digits are 4, 2, 1, 0. So:

4 * 5^3 + 2 * 5^2 + 1 * 5^1 + 0 * 5^0

Calculate each term:

4 * 125 = 500

2 * 25 = 50

1 * 5 = 5

0 * 1 = 0

Adding them up: 500 + 50 = 550, 550 + 5 = 555, and 555 + 0 = 555. Perfect, that adds up to 555.
</execution_6.1>

<execution_6.2>
5*111 = 555, remainder 0. Correct.

Second division: 111 รท5. 5*22=110, remainder 1. Correct.

Third division: 22 รท5. 5*4=20, remainder 2. Correct.

Fourth division: 4 รท5. Quotient 0, remainder 4. Correct.

So the remainders are 0,1,2,4. Reverse them to get 4,2,1,0. So 4*125 + 2*25 +1*5 +0*1 = 500 +50 +5 +0=555.
</execution_6.2>

<execution_6.3>
5^3 = 125. 5^4 is 625, which is too big. So the highest power is 5^3. So 125 times 4 is 500, which is less than 555. 125 times 5 is 625, which is too big. So the coefficient for 5^3 is 4. Then 555 - 500 = 55. Now, moving to the next lower power, 5^2 = 25. 25 times 2 is 50, which is less than 55. 25 times 3 is 75, which is too big. So coefficient for 5^2 is 2. Then 55 - 50 = 5. Next, 5^1 = 5. 5 times 1 is 5, so coefficient is 1. Subtract 5, we get 0. Then the last digit (5^0) is 0. So putting it all together, 4*125 + 2*25 + 1*5 + 0*1 = 555. So the digits are 4, 2, 1, 0. Therefore, 4210 base 5.
</execution_6.3>

<execution_6.4>
Wait, 22 divided by 5: 5*4=20, remainder 2. That's correct. Then 4 divided by 5 is 0 with remainder 4. So yes, the remainders are 0,1,2,4, reversed gives 4,2,1,0. So 4210 base 5.
</execution_6.4>
</Execution_6>

<Final_answer>
Therefore, $555_{10}$ in base $5$ is $\boxed{4210_5}$.
