Okay, let's see. The problem is to compute a + b + c, where a, b, and c are the roots of the equation (1/x) + 5x² = 6x - 24. Hmm, right. So first, I need to recall that for a cubic equation, the sum of the roots can be found using Vieta's formulas. But wait, Vieta's formulas apply to polynomials, right? So the first step is probably to rewrite the given equation in the standard polynomial form, which is ax³ + bx² + cx + d = 0. Once it's in that form, I can apply Vieta's formula, which for a cubic equation ax³ + bx² + cx + d = 0, the sum of the roots is -b/a.

But before that, let me make sure there are three roots. The original equation is (1/x) + 5x² = 6x - 24. Let me check if this is a cubic equation. Let's rearrange the terms.

But just to be thorough, maybe we can check if the original equation is equivalent to the cubic equation. Let's see.

Starting with (1/x) + 5x² = 6x - 24. Let's subtract 6x and add 24 to both sides to get everything on one side:

5x² + (1/x) - 6x + 24 = 0.
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
The original equation is (1/x) + 5x² = 6x - 24. Multiply both sides by x, assuming x ≠ 0 (since x=0 is not in the domain of the original equation). Then we get 1 + 5x³ = 6x² - 24x. Then, moving all terms to left: 5x³ - 6x² + 24x + 1 = 0. So, yes, the equation is equivalent to 5x³ - 6x² + 24x + 1 = 0, which is a cubic equation. Therefore, there are three roots (counting multiplicity and considering complex roots as well, but since the coefficients are real, complex roots would come in conjugate pairs).

Based on execution_1.1:
But there's a 1/x term here, which complicates things. To eliminate the fraction, I can multiply both sides by x, but I need to consider that x ≠ 0. So multiplying both sides by x gives:

<prompt_2.1> Eliminate the fraction in the equation by multiplying both sides by x, and verify that x ≠ 0. </prompt_2.1>

Based on execution_1.2:
Therefore, Vieta's formula applies, and the sum of the roots is indeed 6/5.

But let me check if there's a possibility of missing roots or introducing extraneous roots when multiplying by x. For example, when we multiply both sides by x, we have to ensure that x ≠ 0.

<prompt_2.2> Check for any missing or extraneous roots when multiplying by x. </prompt_2.2>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
x*(5x²) + x*(1/x) = x*(6x) - x*24

Simplifying each term:

5x³ + 1 = 6x² - 24x

Now, let's bring all terms to one side to set the equation to zero:

5x³ + 1 - 6x² + 24x = 0

Rearranging the terms in descending order of degree:

5x³ - 6x² + 24x + 1 = 0
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
The original equation has 1/x, so x=0 is excluded from the domain. Therefore, when we multiply both sides by x, we get a new equation 5x³ - 6x² + 24x + 1 = 0, and the roots of this cubic equation are the same as the original equation's roots, excluding x=0. But since the cubic equation is 5x³ - 6x² + 24x + 1 = 0, x=0 is not a root here because substituting x=0 gives 0 - 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 ≠ 0. Therefore, all roots of the cubic equation are valid roots of the original equation, and there are no extraneous roots introduced. So, the three roots of the cubic equation are exactly the roots a, b, c of the original equation.

Based on execution_2.1:
Let me double-check that step. Starting from the original equation: (1/x) + 5x² = 6x - 24. Multiplying both sides by x:

Based on execution_2.2:
Therefore, Vieta's formula applies, and the sum of the roots is 6/5.

But let me just confirm Vieta's formula for cubic equations. For a general cubic equation ax³ + bx² + cx + d = 0, the sum of the roots is -b/a.

<prompt_3.2> Confirm Vieta's formula for the sum of the roots of the cubic equation. </prompt_3.2>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
Left side: 1/x * x + 5x² * x = 1 + 5x³

Right side: 6x * x - 24 * x = 6x² - 24x

So, yes, that gives 5x³ + 1 = 6x² - 24x, which when rearranged gives 5x³ - 6x² + 24x + 1 = 0.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
Right? Because if the cubic is written as a(x³) + b(x²) + c(x) + d = 0, then the coefficient of x³ is a, x² is b, etc. , so the sum is -b/a. In our case, the equation is 5x³ - 6x² + 24x + 1 = 0. So here, a (coefficient of x³) is 5, b (coefficient of x²) is -6, c (coefficient of x) is 24, d is 1. Therefore, the sum of the roots is -b/a = -(-6)/5 = 6/5.

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.2:
Therefore, a + b + c = 6/5. 

But wait, just to make sure there isn't a trick here. The problem states that a, b, c are the roots of the equation.
So, in the context of the original equation, which is a cubic equation, there are three roots, and their sum is 6/5. Therefore, the answer is 6/5.

I think that's thorough.
I considered potential issues like multiplying by x, checked that there are three roots, confirmed via Vieta's formula, and even checked the equivalence of the original equation and the cubic equation. So I feel confident that the sum is indeed 6/5.
