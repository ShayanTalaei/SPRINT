Okay, so I need to figure out how many y-intercepts the graph of the parabola given by the equation x = y² - 4y - 1 has. Hmm, let me start by recalling what a y-intercept is. If I remember correctly, a y-intercept occurs where the graph crosses the y-axis. And at the y-axis, the value of x is 0. So, to find the y-intercepts, I should set x = 0 and solve for y. The number of real solutions I get for y will tell me how many y-intercepts the graph has.

Alright, let's apply that.

<prompt_1.1> Set up the equation to find the y-intercepts by substituting x = 0 into the given parabola equation. </prompt_1.1>

<execution_1.1>
Starting with the original equation:
x = y² - 4y - 1

Set x = 0 (since we're looking for y-intercepts):
0 = y² - 4y - 1

So now I have a quadratic equation in terms of y: y² - 4y - 1 = 0.

Based on execution_1.1:
To solve this quadratic equation, I can use the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is y = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / (2a) where the equation is in the form ay² + by + c = 0. Here, a = 1, b = -4, and c = -1.

<prompt_2.1> Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula to find the discriminant and determine the number of real solutions. </prompt_2.1>

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in identifying the coefficients. The equation is y² - 4y - 1 = 0.

<prompt_2.2> Verify the application of the quadratic formula and the calculation of the discriminant. </prompt_2.2>

So that would mean the graph crosses the y-axis at two points: (0, 2 + √5) and (0, 2 - √5).
Therefore, there are two y-intercepts.

But hold on, let me visualize the graph to confirm. The given equation is x = y² - 4y - 1. This is a parabola that opens either to the right or to the left because it's in the form x = ay² + by + c. Since the coefficient of y² is positive (1 in this case), the parabola opens to the right.

<prompt_2.3> Visualize the graph of the parabola and confirm the number of y-intercepts based on the direction it opens. </prompt_2.3>

Alternatively, maybe I can complete the square to see the vertex form of the parabola. Let's try that.

<prompt_2.4> Use the method of completing the square to rewrite the equation in vertex form and verify the number of y-intercepts. </prompt_2.4>

Another way to check is to think about the discriminant. Since the discriminant is positive, there are two real roots, which correspond to two points where the parabola crosses the y-axis. If the discriminant was zero, there would be one y-intercept (the vertex touches the y-axis), and if it was negative, no y-intercepts.

<prompt_2.5> Reflect on the discriminant and its implications for the number of y-intercepts in a quadratic equation. </prompt_2.5>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Calculating the discriminant first: b² - 4ac = (-4)² - 4(1)(-1) = 16 - (-4) = 16 + 4 = 20. Wait, is that right? Let me check. The discriminant is b² - 4ac. Here, a is 1, b is -4, c is -1. So substituting:

Discriminant = (-4)^2 - 4*(1)*(-1) = 16 - (-4) = 16 + 4 = 20. Yeah, that's correct. So the discriminant is 20, which is positive. That means there are two distinct real roots. So, solving for y, we have:

y = [4 ± √20]/2

But √20 can be simplified. √20 is 2√5, so:

y = [4 ± 2√5]/2

Dividing numerator terms by 2:

y = 2 ± √5

So the two solutions are y = 2 + √5 and y = 2 - √5.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
So yes, a = 1, b = -4, c = -1. Plugging into the quadratic formula:

y = [4 ± √( (-4)² - 4*1*(-1) )]/(2*1)
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
Parabolas that open to the right or left have their vertices either to the left or right of the y-axis, and their y-intercepts (if any) are points where x=0. Since the vertex of this parabola is at y = -b/(2a) = 4/(2*1) = 2. So when y=2, the vertex is at (x, y) = ( (2)^2 - 4*(2) -1, 2 ) = (4 - 8 -1, 2) = (-5, 2). So the vertex is at (-5, 2), which is to the left of the y-axis. Since the parabola opens to the right (as the coefficient is positive), it will extend from the vertex upwards and downwards. 

Therefore, when x=0, which is to the right of the vertex, the parabola should intersect the y-axis at two points, which aligns with the two solutions we found earlier.

<execution_2.4>
Starting with x = y² - 4y - 1.

Let's complete the square for the y terms. Take the y² - 4y part. To complete the square, we take the coefficient of y, which is -4, divide by 2 to get -2, square it to get 4. So:

x = (y² - 4y + 4 - 4) - 1
x = (y - 2)² - 4 - 1
x = (y - 2)² - 5

So the vertex form of the parabola is x = (y - 2)² - 5. This tells me the vertex is at ( -5, 2 ) but since this is a horizontal parabola (opening to the right), the vertex is at (h, k) = (-5, 2). The vertex is the point farthest to the left on the parabola, which makes sense because the parabola opens to the right.

<execution_2.5>
But in this case, discriminant is 16 + 4 = 20, which is positive, so two real roots. Therefore, two y-intercepts.

Wait, but let me also consider if there's any possibility that when x=0, there's only one y-value. But since we have two distinct real solutions, there are two points: (0, y1) and (0, y2). Therefore, two y-intercepts.

<Final_answer>
Therefore, the graph of the parabola $x = y^2 - 4y - 1$ has $\boxed{2}$ $y$-intercepts.
