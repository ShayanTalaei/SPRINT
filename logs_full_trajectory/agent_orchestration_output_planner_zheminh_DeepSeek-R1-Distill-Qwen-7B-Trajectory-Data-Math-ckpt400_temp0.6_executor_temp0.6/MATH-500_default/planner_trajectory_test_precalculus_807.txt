Okay, so I need to convert the rectangular coordinate (0,3) to polar coordinates. Hmm, let me remember how to do this. Polar coordinates are in the form (r, θ), where r is the radius (distance from the origin) and θ is the angle made with the positive x-axis. Right?

First, I think the formula for r is straightforward.

<prompt_1.1> Use the rectangular coordinate (0,3) to find the polar coordinate r using the formula \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \). </prompt_1.1>

Now, the angle θ. Since the point is (0,3), it's located on the y-axis, right? In the rectangular coordinate system, (0,3) is straight up along the y-axis, which should correspond to an angle of 90 degrees or π/2 radians.
Let me verify that. 

The formula for θ is usually θ = arctan(y/x), but in this case, x is 0. So if I plug in x = 0, then y/x is 3/0, which is undefined. But I know that when x is 0 and y is positive, the point is on the positive y-axis, which is π/2 radians from the positive x-axis.

I remember it's the square root of x squared plus y squared. So, substituting the given values, x is 0 and y is 3. So, r should be sqrt(0^2 + 3^2) = sqrt(9) = 3. That seems simple enough.

Based on execution_1.1:
Let me check that.

Wait, but maybe I need to be careful here. Let me make sure I'm not missing anything. For θ, when converting from rectangular to polar, if x is 0, then the point lies on the y-axis. If y is positive, it's π/2, and if y is negative, it's 3π/2. Since y here is 3, which is positive, θ should be π/2. 

But let me confirm using the arctan formula. Usually, θ = arctan(y/x), but when x is 0, that formula doesn't work directly because you can't divide by zero. However, I recall that in such cases, we have to consider the limit or use the arctan2 function, which takes into account the signs of both x and y. Since x is 0 and y is positive, arctan2(y, x) would return π/2.

Let me also visualize this. The rectangular coordinate (0,3) is three units up on the y-axis. In polar coordinates, that should be 3 units away from the origin (which it is, since r=3) and an angle of π/2 radians from the positive x-axis (which it is, since we rotate straight up).

Is there any other way this could be represented? For example, could θ be something else but still give the same point when r is 3? Let's see.

<prompt_2.1> Explore if there are alternative representations of the angle θ for the polar coordinate (3, π/2) that still represent the same point. </prompt_2.1>

Wait, but let me check another source or example to make sure. For instance, take the point (0, -3).

<prompt_2.2> Use the point (0, -3) to verify the correctness of the angle calculation for θ in polar coordinates. </prompt_2.2>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
If θ were, say, π/2 plus 2π, that would be 5π/2, but since the problem specifies that θ should be in the range [0, 2π), 5π/2 is outside that range. Similarly, if θ were π/2 minus 2π, that would be -3π/2, which is also outside the range. So the only representation within the given constraints is (3, π/2).
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
That should be at (3, 3π/2) or (3, -π/2), right? Because it's 3 units down, which is equivalent to 3 units at angle 3π/2 or 3π/2 minus 2π, which is -π/2. But in our original problem, since y is positive, it's π/2.

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Another check: if I convert back from polar coordinates (3, π/2) to rectangular, x should be r*cosθ = 3*cos(π/2) = 3*0 = 0, and y should be r*sinθ = 3*sin(π/2) = 3*1 = 3.
Exactly the original coordinates.

Based on execution_2.1, execution_2.2:
Therefore, I think the answer is (3, π/2).

Wait, but let me check if there's any alternative angle that could also give the same point.

<prompt_3.1> Confirm that there are no alternative angles within the range [0, 2π) that represent the same point as (3, π/2) in polar coordinates. </prompt_3.1>

Based on execution_1.1:
Alternatively, sometimes people might think θ is 0, but that would be along the positive x-axis, which is (3,0), not (0,3).
So that's not the case here.

Another way to think about it: in polar coordinates, moving along the positive y-axis is a quarter circle from the positive x-axis, which is π/2 radians. 

I don't think there's any mistake here.
The calculations are straightforward, but since x is 0, we have to rely on the quadrant information.

<prompt_3.2> Reflect on the process of converting (0,3) to polar coordinates, considering any potential mistakes and reaffirm the correctness of the solution. </prompt_3.2>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
For example, if θ is π/2 plus any multiple of 2π, but since we need θ between 0 and 2π, adding 2π to π/2 would give 5π/2, which is outside the range. Similarly, subtracting 2π would give negative angles. So no, there's no other angle within [0, 2π) that would give the same point.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
Since the point is on the axis, not in a quadrant, the angle is well-defined. If both x and y were 0, then r would be 0, but θ would be undefined, but that's not the case here. 

So, in summary, converting (0,3) to polar coordinates gives (3, π/2).

<Final_answer>
Thus, the polar coordinates are $\boxed{(3, \frac{\pi}{2})}$.
