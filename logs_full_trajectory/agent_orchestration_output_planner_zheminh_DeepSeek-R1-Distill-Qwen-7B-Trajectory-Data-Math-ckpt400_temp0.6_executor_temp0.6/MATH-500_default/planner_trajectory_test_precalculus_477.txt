Okay, so I need to find the area of triangle OAB given the vectors OA and OB. Let me see. Hmm, I remember that the area of a triangle formed by two vectors can be found using the cross product. The formula is (1/2) the magnitude of the cross product of the two vectors. Right? So first, I should probably find the cross product of vectors OA and OB, then compute its magnitude, and finally divide by 2 to get the area.

Let me write down the vectors again to make sure I have them right.
Vector OA is [1, 2, 3] and vector OB is [-3, -2, 1].

The cross product of OA and OB, denoted as OA × OB, is calculated using the determinant of a matrix with the standard unit vectors i, j, k in the first row, the components of OA in the second row, and the components of OB in the third row.

So setting that up:

<prompt_1.1> Calculate the cross product of vectors OA and OB using the determinant method. </prompt_1.1>

<execution_1.1>
Cross product OA × OB = |i   j   k|
                     1   2   3
                     -3 -2   1

Calculating the determinant:
i*(2*1 - 3*(-2)) - j*(1*1 - 3*(-3)) + k*(1*(-2) - 2*(-3))

Let me compute each component step by step.

First, the i component: 2*1 is 2, and 3*(-2) is -6, so 2 - (-6) = 2 + 6 = 8. So the i component is 8i.

Next, the j component. Since it's subtracted, it's - [1*1 - 3*(-3)]. Let's compute inside the brackets: 1*1 is 1, and 3*(-3) is -9, so 1 - (-9) = 1 + 9 = 10. So the j component is -10j.

Then the k component: 1*(-2) is -2, and 2*(-3) is -6, so -2 - (-6) = -2 + 6 = 4. So the k component is 4k.

Putting it all together, the cross product OA × OB is the vector [8, -10, 4].

Based on execution_1.1:
Now, I need to find the magnitude of this cross product vector. The magnitude is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of the components.

Alternatively, another method to calculate the area is using the formula: (1/2)|OA||OB|sin(theta), where theta is the angle between them. But since we already did the cross product method, which is equivalent, I think that's sufficient.

Wait, let me just confirm once more that I didn't make a mistake in the cross product calculation. Let me redo it quickly:

<prompt_2.2> Redo the cross product calculation for OA and OB to verify the result. </prompt_2.2>

<execution_2.1>
So, for the vector [8, -10, 4], the magnitude is sqrt(8² + (-10)² + 4²).

Calculating each term:
8² = 64,
(-10)² = 100,
4² = 16.

Adding them up: 64 + 100 + 16 = 180. So the magnitude is sqrt(180).

Simplify sqrt(180): 180 is 36*5, so sqrt(36*5) = 6*sqrt(5).
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
i*(2*1 - 3*(-2)) = i*(2 +6)=8i

-j*(1*1 -3*(-3)) = -j*(1 +9)= -j*10

k*(1*(-2) -2*(-3))=k*(-2 +6)=4k
</execution_2.2>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Therefore, the area of triangle OAB is (1/2)*6*sqrt(5) = 3*sqrt(5).

Wait, let me double-check all steps to ensure there's no mistake. First, cross product calculation:

<prompt_3.1> Verify the cross product calculation and area calculation. </prompt_3.1>
-----

Based on execution_2.2:
So the cross product is [8, -10, 4], magnitude sqrt(8^2 +10^2 +4^2)=sqrt(64+100+16)=sqrt(180).

Divide by 2: sqrt(180)/2 = (6*sqrt(5))/2 = 3*sqrt(5).

For the cross product:

i component: (2*1 - 3*(-2)) = 2 +6 =8 ✔️

j component: - (1*1 -3*(-3)) = - (1 +9)= -10 ✔️

k component: (1*(-2) -2*(-3))= -2 +6=4 ✔️

Magnitude sqrt(8² + (-10)^2 +4^2)=sqrt(64+100+16)=sqrt(180)=6*sqrt(5) ✔️

Area is half of that: 3*sqrt(5).
</execution_3.1>
</Execution_3>

<Final_answer>
Therefore, the area of triangle $OAB$ is $\boxed{3\sqrt{5}}$.
