</Question>

<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to find the value of k such that (3^k)^6 equals 3^6. Hmm, let me start by recalling some exponent rules. First, I remember that when you have an exponent raised to another exponent, you multiply them. So (a^m)^n = a^(m*n). Let me apply that here.

<prompt_1.1> Apply the exponent multiplication rule to simplify the left side of the equation (3^k)^6 and set it equal to the right side 3^6. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
The left side is (3^k)^6, which should become 3^(k*6). So that simplifies to 3^(6k). And the equation given is that this equals 3^6. So now I can write 3^(6k) = 3^6.

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Since the bases are the same (both are base 3), the exponents must be equal for the equation to hold.
That's another exponent rule: if a^b = a^c, then b = c, provided that a is not 0 or 1. Since 3 is neither 0 nor 1, this applies here.

So, setting the exponents equal to each other: 6k = 6.

Now, solving for k. Let's subtract 6 from both sides? Wait, no, that's not necessary. It's a simple equation. 6k = 6.
To solve for k, divide both sides by 6. So k = 6/6 = 1.

Wait, is that right? Let me check.

If k is 1, then the left side becomes (3^1)^6 = 3^6, which is exactly the right side. So 3^6 = 3^6.

But wait, is there another possible solution? Let me think. Exponential equations can sometimes have multiple solutions, especially if dealing with complex numbers, but since we're dealing with real numbers here and base 3 is positive, there should only be one real solution.
So k must be 1.

Let me verify again step by step.

<prompt_2.1> Re-evaluate the solution step by step to verify the correctness of k = 1. </prompt_2.1>

Alternatively, maybe there's another approach. Let's take logarithms on both sides.

<prompt_2.2> Use logarithms to verify the solution for k in the equation (3^k)^6 = 3^6. </prompt_2.2>

Another way to think about it: if (3^k)^6 = 3^6, then taking the sixth root of both sides gives 3^k = 3^1, so again k=1.

<prompt_2.3> Consider taking the sixth root of both sides to verify the solution for k in the equation (3^k)^6 = 3^6. </prompt_2.3>

Wait, maybe if I consider the function f(k) = (3^k)^6. Let's see if this function is injective, meaning that if f(k1) = f(k2), then k1 = k2.

<prompt_2.4> Analyze the function f(k) = (3^k)^6 to determine if it is injective, which would confirm the uniqueness of the solution k = 1. </prompt_2.4>

Alternatively, expanding both sides. Let's write out (3^k)^6.

<prompt_2.5> Expand both sides of the equation (3^k)^6 = 3^6 to verify the solution for k. </prompt_2.5>

Wait, maybe test with another number. Suppose k=2.

<prompt_2.6> Test k=2 and k=0 in the original equation to confirm that only k=1 satisfies (3^k)^6 = 3^6. </prompt_2.6>

Is there a case where exponents could be different but the results are the same? For example, 3^2 = 9, and 3^0 =1, but they are different.
So in this case, since the base is the same and positive, the exponents must be equal.
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Starting with (3^k)^6. Apply exponent multiplication: 3^(k*6) = 3^6. Therefore, k*6 must equal 6. Dividing both sides by 6 gives k = 1.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Taking the natural log of both sides: ln((3^k)^6) = ln(3^6). Using the logarithm power rule, that becomes 6*ln(3^k) = 6*ln(3). Then, 6*k*ln(3) = 6*ln(3). Dividing both sides by 6*ln(3) (assuming ln(3) â‰  0, which it isn't), we get k = 1.
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
Taking log base 3 of both sides: log_3( (3^k)^6 ) = log_3(3^6). On the left side, log base 3 of 3^(6k) is 6k, and on the right side, log base 3 of 3^6 is 6. So again, 6k=6, leading to k=1.
</execution_2.3>

<execution_2.4>
Since 3^k is an exponential function, which is strictly increasing if the base is greater than 1. Since 3 > 1, 3^k is strictly increasing. Therefore, taking the sixth power, which is also a strictly increasing function for positive numbers, the composition should still be strictly increasing. Therefore, the equation f(k) = 3^6 has only one solution, which is k=1.
</execution_2.4>

<execution_2.5>
That's 3^(6k). And that's equal to 3^6. So 3^(6k) = 3^6. Therefore, 6k = 6. So k=1.
</execution_2.5>

<execution_2.6>
Then (3^2)^6 = 3^(12), which is way bigger than 3^6. If k=0, then (3^0)^6 = 1^6 =1, which is not 3^6. So k=1 is the only one that works.
</execution_2.6>

<Final_answer>
Therefore, the value of $k$ that satisfies the equation is $\boxed{1}$.
