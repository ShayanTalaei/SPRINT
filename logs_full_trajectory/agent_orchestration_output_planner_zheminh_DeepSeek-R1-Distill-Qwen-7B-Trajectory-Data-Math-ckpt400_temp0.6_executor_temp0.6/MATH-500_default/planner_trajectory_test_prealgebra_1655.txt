Okay, so I need to find the probability that a randomly selected number from 1 to 100 is divisible by 2 but not by 3. Let me break this down step by step.

First, probability is generally the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. Here, the total number of possible outcomes is 100 because there are 100 numbers in the set. So, the denominator of my probability fraction will be 100. Now, I need to figure out the numerator, which is the count of numbers between 1 and 100 that are divisible by 2 but not by 3.

Let me start with numbers divisible by 2. Those are the even numbers. How many even numbers are there between 1 and 100? Well, every second number is even, so that should be 100 divided by 2, which is 50.

Now, from these 50 even numbers, I need to exclude those that are also divisible by 3. Because the problem says "divisible by 2 and not divisible by 3". So, I need to find how many numbers are divisible by both 2 and 3, and then subtract that count from 50.

Numbers divisible by both 2 and 3 are the numbers divisible by their least common multiple (LCM).
The LCM of 2 and 3 is 6. So, I need to find how many numbers between 1 and 100 are divisible by 6.

To find how many numbers are divisible by 6 in this range, I can divide 100 by 6.

Wait, let me check with an example. Let's take a smaller range, say 1 to 12.

<prompt_1.2> Verify the method by applying it to the range 1 to 12. </prompt_1.2>

Another check: 1 to 6.

<prompt_1.3> Verify the method by applying it to the range 1 to 6. </prompt_1.3>

I think that's solid. Let me see if there's another way to approach this.

Alternatively, the probability of a number being divisible by 2 is 1/2. Then, given that, the probability it's not divisible by 3 is 2/3, since every third number is divisible by 3. So, multiplying these probabilities: 1/2 * 2/3 = 1/3.

<execution_1.1>
Let's see, 6 times 16 is 96, and 6 times 17 is 102, which is over 100. So, there are 16 numbers divisible by 6 up to 96. But wait, 100 divided by 6 is approximately 16.666...., so that means there are 16 full multiples of 6 in the range 1 to 96, and 100 is not a multiple of 6. So, yes, 16 numbers.

The even numbers are 2,4,6,8,10,12 (6 numbers). Numbers divisible by 6 are 6 and 12 (2 numbers). So numbers divisible by 2 but not 3 would be 6 - 2 = 4. Let's list them: 2,4,8,10. Yes, that's 4 numbers. So 4/12 = 1/3.
</execution_1.2>

<execution_1.3>
Numbers divisible by 2: 6 numbers (2,4,6). Numbers divisible by 3: 4 numbers (3,6). Numbers divisible by both 2 and 3: 6. So numbers divisible by 2 but not 3: 6 -1=5 (2,4,6? Wait, wait. Wait in 1-6: divisible by 2 are 2,4,6. Divisible by 6 is only 6. So numbers divisible by 2 but not 3 are 2,4, so 2 numbers. So 2 out of 6. Which is 1/3. Which matches the formula.

Wait, that seems too straightforward. But does this hold?

Wait, no, because the events "divisible by 2" and "divisible by 3" are not independent. So, maybe the multiplication rule here isn't directly applicable. Let me think. The formula would be P(A and not B) = P(A) - P(A and B). Which is the same as what we did before. So, P(A) is 1/2, P(A and B) is the probability that a number is divisible by both 2 and 3, which is divisible by 6, so 1/6. Therefore, P(A and not B) = 1/2 - 1/6 = 1/3.

Based on execution_1.1:
Wait, but 6*16=96, which is less than 100. So, numbers divisible by 6 are 6,12,18,....,96.
So, how many terms are there? The nth term of this sequence is 6n. So, 6n ≤ 100. The maximum n is floor(100/6) = 16. So, yes, 16 numbers. Therefore, there are 16 numbers between 1 and 100 divisible by both 2 and 3.

Therefore, the number of numbers divisible by 2 but not by 3 is 50 - 16 = 34. Therefore, the probability is 34/100. Simplifying that fraction, divide numerator and denominator by 2: 17/50.

Wait, but let me verify this again. Let me think of another way. The inclusion-exclusion principle.

<prompt_2.1> Verify the result using the inclusion-exclusion principle. </prompt_2.1>

Alternatively, using the formula: |A \ B| = |A| - |A ∩ B|. Which is 50 - 16 = 34. So, 34 numbers. 34/100 = 17/50.

Based on execution_1.4:
But let's confirm with actual numbers. In 1-100, numbers divisible by 6: 16 numbers. So, 50 - 16 = 34. 34/100 = 17/50. So, yes, same as before.

Therefore, the probability is 17/50.

But just to make sure, let me recount the numbers divisible by 6 between 1 and 100.

<prompt_2.2> Recount and verify the calculations for the number of integers divisible by 6 and the final probability. </prompt_2.2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Total numbers divisible by 2 or 3 is |A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|. But here, we need numbers divisible by 2 but not by 3, which is |A| - |A ∩ B|. So, that's 50 - 16 = 34. So, same result.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
6*1=6, 6*2=12, ...., 6*16=96. So 16 numbers. Correct. So 50 even numbers minus 16 divisible by 3 gives 34. 34/100 reduces to 17/50.

<Final_answer>
Therefore, the probability that a randomly selected integer from the set $\{1,2,3,\ldots,100\}$ is divisible by 2 and not divisible by 3 is $\boxed{\frac{17}{50}}$.
