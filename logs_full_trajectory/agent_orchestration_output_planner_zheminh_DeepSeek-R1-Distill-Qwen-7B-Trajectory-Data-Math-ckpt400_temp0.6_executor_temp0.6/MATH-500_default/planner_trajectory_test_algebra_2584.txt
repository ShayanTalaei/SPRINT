Okay, let's see. I need to find the value of f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) where the function f(x) is given as (3x - 2)/(x - 2). Hmm, alright. Let me start by understanding the problem. So, the function f(x) is a rational function, right? The numerator is 3x - 2 and the denominator is x - 2. I need to compute the sum of f evaluated at three different points: -2, -1, and 0. 

First, maybe I should just compute each value individually and then add them up. That seems straightforward. Let me check if there's a shortcut or a pattern that could make the calculation easier, but since the points are specific, maybe direct computation is the way to go.

Let me recall how to evaluate a function at a given point.
For f(-2), I substitute x = -2 into the function. Similarly for the others. Let's start with f(-2).

So, f(-2) = [3*(-2) - 2]/[(-2) - 2]. Let me compute the numerator first: 3*(-2) is -6, minus 2 is -8. The denominator is -2 - 2, which is -4. So f(-2) is (-8)/(-4) which simplifies to 2. Okay, that's straightforward.

Next, f(-1). Substitute x = -1 into the function.

<prompt_1.1> Evaluate the function at x = -1 as per the above plan. </prompt_1.1>

Now, f(0). Substitute x = 0 into the function.

<prompt_1.2> Evaluate the function at x = 0 as per the above plan. </prompt_1.2>

Numerator: 3*(-1) - 2. That's -3 - 2 = -5. Denominator: (-1) - 2 = -3. So f(-1) is (-5)/(-3) which simplifies to 5/3. Hmm, wait, because negative divided by negative is positive. So 5/3.
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
So numerator is 3*0 - 2 = -2. Denominator is 0 - 2 = -2. So f(0) is (-2)/(-2) = 1. Got that.

</Execution_1>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1, execution_1.2:
Now, summing them up: f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) = 2 + 5/3 + 1.

Let me compute that. 2 + 1 is 3, and 3 + 5/3. To add 3 and 5/3, convert 3 to thirds: 3 is 9/3.
So 9/3 + 5/3 = 14/3. So the total sum is 14/3.

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's verify each computation.

<prompt_2.1> Verify the calculations for f(-2), f(-1), and f(0) as per the above plan. </prompt_2.1>

Hmm. But let me think again. Is there another way to approach this? Maybe combining the fractions first before substituting the values? Let's see.

<prompt_2.2> Consider if combining the fractions first could simplify the calculation as per the above plan. </prompt_2.2>

But just to be thorough, let me check once more each computation step.

<prompt_2.3> Recheck the calculations for f(-2), f(-1), and f(0) as per the above plan. </prompt_2.3>

Alternatively, maybe there's a different method. Let me try another approach.

<prompt_2.4> Explore another method by finding a common denominator as per the above plan. </prompt_2.4>

Alternatively, maybe using polynomial division? Let's see. The function is (3x -2)/(x -2). Let's perform division:

<prompt_2.5> Perform polynomial division on the function as per the above plan. </prompt_2.5>

Therefore, the answer is 14/3.

Wait, but just to ensure that there's no mistake in the arithmetic. Let me re-add the numbers:

<prompt_2.6> Re-add the values to verify the sum as per the above plan. </prompt_2.6>

Alternatively, if I convert all to fractions:

<prompt_2.7> Convert all values to fractions and verify the sum as per the above plan. </prompt_2.7>

Therefore, I think the answer is correct.
The key steps were substituting each x value into the function, computing the numerator and denominator for each, simplifying the fractions, and then adding them up. Each step checked out, so the sum is indeed 14/3.

<execution_2.1>
First, f(-2): (3*(-2) -2)/(-2 -2) = (-6 -2)/(-4) = (-8)/(-4) = 2. Correct. 

f(-1): (3*(-1) -2)/(-1 -2) = (-3 -2)/(-3) = (-5)/(-3) = 5/3. Correct. 

f(0): (3*0 -2)/(0 -2) = (-2)/(-2) = 1. Correct. 

Adding them: 2 + 5/3 + 1. 2 +1 is 3, plus 5/3 is 3 + 5/3. Since 3 is 9/3, 9/3 +5/3=14/3.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
The function is f(x) = (3x -2)/(x -2). So, if I need to compute f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0), that would be:

[3*(-2) -2]/[(-2)-2] + [3*(-1)-2]/[(-1)-2] + [3*0 -2]/[0 -2]

Calculating each term as before:

First term: (-6 -2)/(-4) = (-8)/(-4) = 2

Second term: (-3 -2)/(-3) = (-5)/(-3) = 5/3

Third term: (-2)/(-2) = 1

Adding them: 2 + 5/3 + 1 = 14/3.
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
First, f(-2):

Numerator: 3*(-2) - 2 = -6 -2 = -8. Correct. Denominator: -2 -2 = -4. So -8/-4 = 2. Correct.

f(-1):

3*(-1) -2 = -3 -2 = -5. Denominator: -1 -2 = -3. -5/-3 = 5/3. Correct.

f(0):

3*0 -2 = -2. Denominator: 0 -2 = -2. -2/-2 = 1. Correct.

Adding them: 2 + 5/3 +1. 2 +1 =3. 3 is 9/3. 9/3 +5/3=14/3.
</execution_2.3>

<execution_2.4>
The function is f(x) = (3x -2)/(x -2). Let's see if we can decompose this into simpler fractions or separate the terms. For instance, we can write it as:

(3x - 2)/(x - 2) = [3(x - 2) + 6 - 2]/(x - 2) = [3(x - 2) + 4]/(x - 2) = 3 + 4/(x - 2)

Wait, is that correct? Let's check:

Let me rewrite the numerator: 3x -2. Let's express 3x -2 in terms of (x -2). Let's see:

3x -2 = 3(x -2 + 2) -2 = 3(x -2) + 6 -2 = 3(x -2) +4. Therefore, yes:

(3x -2)/(x -2) = [3(x -2) +4]/(x -2) = 3 + 4/(x -2)

So f(x) can be written as 3 + 4/(x -2). That might be a simpler way to compute the sum. Let me try this alternative method.

So f(x) = 3 + 4/(x -2). Therefore, f(-2) = 3 + 4/(-2 -2) = 3 + 4/(-4) = 3 -1 = 2. Same as before.

Similarly, f(-1) = 3 + 4/(-1 -2) = 3 + 4/(-3) = 3 - 4/3 = (9/3 -4/3) = 5/3. Same result.

f(0) = 3 + 4/(0 -2) = 3 + 4/(-2) = 3 -2 =1. Same as before. So adding them up gives 2 +5/3 +1 =14/3. So same answer. So this alternative method confirms the result.

<execution_2.5>
Divide 3x -2 by x -2. How many times does x -2 go into 3x -2? The leading term is 3x divided by x, which is 3. Then multiply 3 by (x -2) to get 3x -6. Subtract that from 3x -2:

(3x -2) - (3x -6) = 3x -2 -3x +6 = 4. So the division gives 3 with a remainder of 4. Therefore, (3x -2)/(x -2) can be written as 3 + 4/(x -2). Hmm, interesting. So f(x) = 3 + 4/(x -2). Maybe this alternative expression could make the summation easier? Let's see.

So, f(x) = 3 + 4/(x -2). Then, f(-2) would be 3 + 4/(-2 -2) = 3 + 4/(-4) = 3 - 1 = 2. That's the same as before. Similarly, f(-1) = 3 + 4/(-1 -2) = 3 + 4/(-3) = 3 - 4/3 = 5/3. And f(0) = 3 + 4/(0 -2) = 3 + 4/(-2) = 3 - 2 = 1. So same results.
</execution_2.5>

<execution_2.6>
2 (from f(-2)) + 5/3 (from f(-1)) + 1 (from f(0)).

2 + 1 is 3, correct. 3 + 5/3: 3 is 9/3, so 9/3 +5/3=14/3.
</execution_2.6>

<execution_2.7>
2 is 2/1, 5/3 is already a fraction, and 1 is 1/1. So converting all to thirds:

2 = 6/3, 5/3 remains, 1 = 3/3. So adding them up: 6/3 + 5/3 + 3/3 = (6 +5 +3)/3 =14/3. Yep, same result.
</execution_2.7>
</Execution_2>

<Final_answer>
Therefore, the value of $f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0)$, expressed as a common fraction, is $\boxed{\frac{14}{3}}$.
