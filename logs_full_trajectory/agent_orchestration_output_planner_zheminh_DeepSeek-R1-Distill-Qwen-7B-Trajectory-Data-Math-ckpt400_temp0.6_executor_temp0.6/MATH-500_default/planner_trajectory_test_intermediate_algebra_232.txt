</Question>

<Plan_1>
Okay, let's see. The problem is to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) of integers such that the absolute value of a + bi is less than or equal to 5. Hmm, right. So, first, I need to recall what the absolute value (or modulus) of a complex number means.

<prompt_1.1> Explain the concept of the modulus of a complex number and how it relates to the given problem. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
For a complex number a + bi, the modulus |a + bi| is calculated as the square root of (a² + b²). So, the condition |a + bi| ≤ 5 translates to √(a² + b²) ≤ 5. If I square both sides to eliminate the square root, that gives me a² + b² ≤ 25. So, essentially, we need to find all integer pairs (a, b) such that when you square them and add them together, the result is less than or equal to 25.

Based on execution_1.1:
Alright, so the next step is to figure out all integer solutions (a, b) to the inequality a² + b² ≤ 25. Since both a and b are integers, their squares will be non-negative integers, and the sum has to be at most 25. Let me think about how to approach enumerating these pairs.

First, maybe I can fix a value for a and then determine the possible values of b that satisfy the inequality for that a. Since a and b are symmetric in the equation (swapping a and b gives the same inequality), but since the problem asks for ordered pairs, (a, b) and (b, a) are considered different if a ≠ b. Wait, no, actually, in this case, the inequality is symmetric in a and b, so for each a, the possible b's will depend on a. But maybe it's easier to just iterate through possible a values and for each, find the corresponding b's.

Let's start by considering the possible integer values of a. Since a² must be less than or equal to 25 (because even if b is 0, a² ≤ 25), the possible integer values of a are from -5 to 5 inclusive.

Wait, but let me double-check. Let me think of another way. The number of integer solutions to a² + b² ≤ r² is a known problem. For r = 5, the number of lattice points inside a circle of radius 5.

<prompt_2.2> Consider known results or formulas for counting lattice points within a circle. </prompt_2.2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
That's because 5² = 25, and 6² = 36 which is already over 25. So, a can range from -5 to 5. Similarly, for each a, b can range such that b² ≤ 25 - a². So, for each a, the possible b's are integers from -floor(√(25 - a²)) to floor(√(25 - a²)), inclusive.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
There's a formula, but maybe it's easier to count them manually.

Alternatively, the number of integer points (a, b) where a² + b² ≤ 25. For each a from -5 to 5, find the number of b's such that b² ≤ 25 - a². So, for each a, the maximum b is floor(sqrt(25 - a²)), and the minimum b is -floor(sqrt(25 - a²)). Then the number of b's is 2*floor(sqrt(25 - a²)) + 1 (including zero). Let's verify this with our previous calculation.

For example, when a = 0, 25 - 0 = 25, sqrt(25) = 5, so floor(5) = 5, so number of b's is 2*5 +1 = 11. Correct. Similarly, for a = 1, 25 -1 =24, sqrt(24) ≈4.898, floor is 4, so 2*4 +1=9. Correct. So the formula works.

So, general approach: for each a from -5 to 5, compute 2*floor(sqrt(25 - a²)) +1, then sum all these numbers. However, since a is symmetric around 0, except for a=0, the counts for a and -a will be the same. Therefore, we can compute the count for a=0, then for a=1 to 5, compute each count and double it (since a and -a will have the same number of b's), then add all together. Wait, but a=0 is unique. Let's check:

Total pairs = count(a=0) + 2*(count(a=1) + count(a=2) + count(a=3) + count(a=4) + count(a=5))

But wait, let's see. For example, a=1 and a=-1 both have the same number of b's. Similarly for a=2, a=-2, etc. So, yes, except for a=0, all other a's come in pairs. Therefore, we can compute the count for a=0, then compute counts for a=1 to 5, multiply each by 2, and sum all.

Based on execution_2.1:
But since the problem includes negative integers as well, we need to consider all four quadrants. However, since the modulus is symmetric with respect to both a and b, maybe we can compute the number of solutions in the first quadrant (where a and b are non-negative) and then multiply by 4, adjusting for points on the axes which are shared between quadrants.

Wait, but maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, since a can be negative, for each positive a, there is a corresponding negative a with the same number of b's. So, perhaps we can compute the number of solutions for a ≥ 0 and then double them (except for a=0, which only occurs once). Let me think.

<prompt_3.1> Explore alternative methods to count the integer solutions, considering symmetry and quadrant distribution. </prompt_3.1>

Based on execution_2.2:
Let's compute this.

First, compute for a=0:

<prompt_3.2> Compute the number of integer points within a circle of radius 5 using the alternative method. </prompt_3.2>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
Let's list all possible a from 0 to 5 and compute the number of b's for each, then account for negative a's. For example, if a is 1, then both (1, b) and (-1, b) are valid pairs, so their counts would double. Similarly for a=2, 3, 4, 5. However, for a=0, since it's the same when replaced by -0 (which is 0), we don't double that.

So, maybe the total number of ordered pairs is 1 (for a=0) * (number of b's when a=0) + 2*(sum over a=1 to 5 of number of b's for each a). Let me structure this:

Total pairs = [Number of b's when a=0] + 2*[Number of b's when a=1 + Number of b's when a=2 + ... + Number of b's when a=5]

But let's check this with an example. Suppose a=1. Then, possible b's are from -4 to 4 (since 1² + b² ≤25 => b² ≤24 => |b| ≤4). So, that's 9 values. Then, for a=1 and a=-1, each has 9 b's, so total 18. Similarly for other a's.

Alternatively, if we compute for a=0, we have 11 pairs (b from -5 to 5). Then for a=1 and a=-1, each has 9, so 18. Then a=2 and a=-2, each has 7, so 14. a=3 and a=-3, each has 5, so 10. a=4 and a=-4, each has 3, so 6. a=5 and a=-5, each has 1, so 2. Then total pairs would be 11 + 18 +14 +10 +6 +2. Let's add these up:

11 + 18 = 29

29 +14 =43

43 +10=53

53 +6=59

59 +2=61.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
25 - 0² =25. sqrt(25)=5. So floor(5)=5. So number of b's is 2*5 +1=11. So 11 points.

For a=1:

25 -1=24. sqrt(24)≈4.898, floor=4. So 2*4 +1=9. So 9 points. Since a=1 and a=-1 both contribute 9 each, total for a=±1 is 2*9=18.

Similarly, a=2:

25 -4=21. sqrt(21)≈4.583, floor=4. So 2*4 +1=9. So 9 points each for a=2 and a=-2, total 18.

a=3:

25 -9=16. sqrt(16)=4. floor=4. So 2*4 +1=9. So same as above. So 9 each for a=3 and a=-3, total 18.

a=4:

25 -16=9. sqrt(9)=3. floor=3. So 2*3 +1=7. So 7 each for a=4 and a=-4, total 14.

a=5:

25 -25=0. sqrt(0)=0. floor=0. So 2*0 +1=1. So only (5,0) and (-5,0) but wait, for a=5, b can only be 0. Similarly for a=-5, b can only be 0. So each has 1 point, total 2.

Wait, but hold on. Wait, when a=5, b² ≤ 0, so b=0. So only one point (5,0). Similarly for a=-5, only (-5,0). So each contributes 1, so total 2.

So now, summing all up:

a=0: 11

a=±1: 18

a=±2: 18

a=±3: 18

a=±4: 14

a=±5: 2

Total: 11 + 18 + 18 + 18 +14 +2 = Let's compute step by step:

11 +18 =29

29 +18=47

47 +18=65

65 +14=79

79 +2=81.

So, total 81 ordered pairs.

But wait, is that accurate? Let me verify step by step.

Based on execution_3.2:
But let me check if this is correct. Because sometimes when you do these quadrant-based calculations, it's easy to miscount.

Alternatively, maybe I should list all possible a from -5 to 5 and for each a, list the possible b's and count them.

Let me try that.

<prompt_4.2> Verify the total number of integer points within a circle of radius 5 by listing possible a and b values. </prompt_4.2>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
First, a=0: b can be from -5 to 5 inclusive. That's 11 values. Correct.

Next, a=1: b² ≤24. So b can be integers from -4 to 4 inclusive (since 4²=16 ≤24, 5²=25>24). So that's 9 values. Then, since a can be 1 or -1, that's 2*9=18. Correct.

a=2: a²=4, so b² ≤21. sqrt(21)≈4.583, so floor is 4. So b from -4 to 4, same as a=1. So 9 values each for a=2 and a=-2, total 18. Correct.

a=3: a²=9, so b² ≤16. sqrt(16)=4, so b from -4 to 4. Wait, 4²=16, so b can be -4, -3,....,4. That's 9 values. So same as before. So 9 each for a=3 and a=-3, total 18. Correct.

a=4: a²=16, so b² ≤9. sqrt(9)=3. So b can be from -3 to 3 inclusive. That's 7 values. So 7 each for a=4 and a=-4, total 14. Correct.

a=5: a²=25, so b² ≤0. So b=0. Only 1 value. So 1 each for a=5 and a=-5, total 2. Correct.

Adding all these up: 11 + 18 +18 +18 +14 +2.
</execution_4.1>

<execution_4.2>
Starting with a = -5:

a = -5:

a² = 25. Then b² ≤ 25 -25 =0. So b² ≤0 => b=0. So only one pair: (-5, 0).

a = -4:

a² =16. Then b² ≤25 -16=9. So b can be -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3. That's 7 values. So 7 pairs: (-4, -3), (-4, -2), ...., (-4, 3).

a = -3:

a²=9. b² ≤16. So b can be -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. That's 9 values. So 9 pairs.

a = -2:

a²=4. b² ≤21. sqrt(21)≈4.583, so b can be from -4 to 4 (since 4²=16 ≤21, 5²=25>21). So same as a=-2: b from -4 to4, 9 values. So 9 pairs.

a = -1:

Same as a=-2? Wait, a²=1. So b² ≤24. sqrt(24)≈4.899, so floor is 4. So b from -4 to4, same as above. So 9 pairs.

a = 0:

a²=0. b² ≤25. b from -5 to5, 11 values. So 11 pairs.

a =1:

Same as a=-1: a²=1, so b from -4 to4, 9 pairs.

a=2:

Same as a=-2: a²=4, b from -4 to4, 9 pairs.

a=3:

Same as a=-3: a²=9, b from -4 to4, 9 pairs? Wait, wait. Wait, a=3, a²=9, so b² ≤16. So b can be from -4 to4? Wait, 4²=16, which is equal to 16. So yes, b can be -4, -3,....,4. So 9 values. So 9 pairs.

a=4:

Same as a=-4: a²=16, b from -3 to3, 7 pairs.

a=5:

Same as a=-5: a²=25, b=0. So 1 pair.

Now, let's list all these counts:

a=-5:1

a=-4:7

a=-3:9

a=-2:9

a=-1:9

a=0:11

a=1:9

a=2:9

a=3:9

a=4:7

a=5:1

Now, let's add them all up:

Start from a=-5 to a=5:

1 (a=-5) +

7 (a=-4) =8

+9 (a=-3)=17

+9 (a=-2)=26

+9 (a=-1)=35

+11 (a=0)=46

+9 (a=1)=55

+9 (a=2)=64

+9 (a=3)=73

+7 (a=4)=80

+1 (a=5)=81.

So total 81 ordered pairs.

But let me think again if there's any possibility of overcounting or undercounting.

<prompt_5.1> Perform a final verification of the total count of integer points within a circle of radius 5 and conclude. </prompt_5.1>
</Plan_5>

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
For example, when a=0, we have b from -5 to5, which is 11 points. Correct. For a=1, both positive and negative a's have b from -4 to4, which is 9 each. Similarly for others. So the count seems correct.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the number of lattice points inside a circle. The exact number is given by 1 + 4*floor(r) + 4*sum_{i=1}^{floor(r)} floor( sqrt(r² - i²) ). But in this case, r=5, so let's compute:

Number of points =1 +4*5 +4*sum_{i=1}^5 floor(sqrt(25 -i²))

Compute each term:

1 +20 +4*[sum_{i=1}^5 floor(sqrt(25 -i²))]

Compute the sum:

For i=1: sqrt(25 -1)=sqrt(24)≈4.899, floor=4

i=2: sqrt(25 -4)=sqrt(21)≈4.583, floor=4

i=3: sqrt(25 -9)=sqrt(16)=4, floor=4

i=4: sqrt(25 -16)=sqrt(9)=3, floor=3

i=5: sqrt(25 -25)=0, floor=0

So sum=4+4+4+3+0=15

Therefore, total points=1 +20 +4*15=1 +20 +60=81. Yes, same result. So that confirms it.

Therefore, the answer is 81.
