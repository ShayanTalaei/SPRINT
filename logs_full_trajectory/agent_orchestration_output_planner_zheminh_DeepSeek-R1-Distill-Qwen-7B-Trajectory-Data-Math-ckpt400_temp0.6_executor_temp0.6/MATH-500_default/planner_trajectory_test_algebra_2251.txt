Okay, so I need to solve the equation √(3x - 5) = 2. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. Alright, the equation involves a square root, so my first thought is that I should eliminate the square root by squaring both sides of the equation. That usually helps in these kinds of problems. Let me write that down.

<prompt_1.1> Square both sides of the equation √(3x - 5) = 2 to eliminate the square root. </prompt_1.1>

Starting with the original equation:
√(3x - 5) = 2

If I square both sides, that should get rid of the square root. Let me do that:
(√(3x - 5))² = 2²

Which simplifies to:
3x - 5 = 4

Based on execution_1.1:
Wait, is that all? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should check if there are any other solutions or if this is the only one.
Let me make sure I didn't miss anything.

First, when you square both sides of an equation, sometimes extraneous solutions can pop up. So, even though squaring both sides gives a solution, I need to verify if it actually satisfies the original equation. Let me keep that in mind.

But before that, let me just solve the equation step by step. So, continuing from 3x - 5 = 4.

<prompt_2.1> Solve the equation 3x - 5 = 4 to find the value of x. </prompt_2.1>

Is there any other possible solution? Let me think.

<prompt_2.2> Consider if there could be any other solutions due to the nature of square roots. </prompt_2.2>

Add 5 to both sides:
3x = 4 + 5
3x = 9

Then divide both sides by 3:
x = 9 / 3
x = 3
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
The square root function only outputs non-negative values, so the left side of the original equation √(3x - 5) is equal to 2, which is positive. So, there's no ambiguity here. If the right side were negative, there would be no solution, but since it's positive, squaring both sides gives the correct solution.

Based on execution_2.1:
Now, I need to check if this solution is valid in the original equation. Let's substitute x = 3 back into the original equation to see if both sides are equal.
Original equation:
√(3x - 5) = 2

Left side:
√(3*3 - 5) = √(9 - 5) = √4 = 2

Right side:
2

So, 2 = 2.
That checks out.

Wait, but let me make sure there aren't any other solutions. For example, sometimes when you square both sides, you can introduce solutions that don't actually work in the original equation. Let me see if there's another possible value for x here.

<prompt_3.1> Check if there could be another solution by considering the nature of squaring both sides. </prompt_3.1>

Wait, but the square root function only outputs the principal (non-negative) root. So, when we have √(3x - 5) = 2, the left side is forced to be non-negative, which it is, since 2 is positive. So, there's no issue here. If there were a negative number on the right side, the equation would have no solution. But here, since both sides are positive, squaring should preserve the solution.

Based on execution_3.1:
Another thing to check is the domain of the original equation. The expression inside the square root, 3x - 5, must be greater than or equal to zero. So:

<prompt_4.1> Verify the solution by checking the domain of the original equation and ensuring the solution does not violate it. </prompt_4.1>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
3x - 5 ≥ 0

Solving for x:

3x ≥ 5

x ≥ 5/3 ≈ 1.666...

Our solution is x = 3, which is greater than 5/3, so the solution is within the domain.

<Final_answer>
x = \boxed{3}
