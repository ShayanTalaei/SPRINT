Okay, let's try to figure out the degree of the polynomial f. So, the problem says that (x - 1) multiplied by f(x) equals this fourth-degree polynomial: 3x⁴ + x³ - 25x² + 38x - 17. Hmm, right. So, if I remember correctly, when you multiply two polynomials, the degree of the resulting polynomial is the sum of the degrees of the two original polynomials. 

Let me verify that.
If I have a polynomial of degree m multiplied by a polynomial of degree n, the product should be degree m + n. Yeah, that seems right. For example, multiplying a linear (degree 1) by a quadratic (degree 2) gives a cubic (degree 3). So, in this case, (x - 1) is a linear polynomial, so its degree is 1. The product (x - 1)·f(x) is given as a fourth-degree polynomial. So, if I let the degree of f(x) be d, then the degree of the product should be 1 + d. But the product is degree 4, so 1 + d = 4. Solving for d gives d = 3. So, the degree of f should be 3.

Wait, but maybe I need to check if there's a possibility that (x - 1) is a factor of the right-hand side polynomial. If (x - 1) is a factor, then dividing the given polynomial by (x - 1) would indeed give a cubic polynomial. But let me confirm if (x - 1) is actually a factor.

To check if (x - 1) is a factor, I can use the Factor Theorem, which states that (x - a) is a factor of a polynomial p(x) if p(a) = 0. So, if I substitute x = 1 into the polynomial 3x⁴ + x³ - 25x² + 38x - 17, does it equal zero?

Let me compute that:

<prompt_1.1> Substitute x = 1 into the polynomial \(3x^4 + x^3 - 25x^2 + 38x - 17\) and check if it equals zero. </prompt_1.1>

Alternatively, maybe I can perform polynomial division to confirm. Let's divide 3x⁴ + x³ - 25x² + 38x - 17 by (x - 1) and see if the quotient is indeed a cubic polynomial.

<prompt_1.2> Perform polynomial division of \(3x^4 + x^3 - 25x^2 + 38x - 17\) by \(x - 1\) and find the quotient. </prompt_1.2>

Alternatively, maybe I can use synthetic division. Let's try synthetic division with root 1.

Calculating each term step by step:

3(1)^4 = 3*1 = 3

1^3 = 1, so next term is 1

-25(1)^2 = -25*1 = -25

38(1) = 38

-17 is just -17.

Adding them all up: 3 + 1 - 25 + 38 - 17.

Let's compute step by step:

3 + 1 = 4

4 - 25 = -21

-21 + 38 = 17

17 - 17 = 0.

Dividing 3x⁴ + x³ - 25x² + 38x - 17 by (x - 1):

Set up the division: dividing 3x⁴ + x³ - 25x² + 38x - 17 by x - 1.

First term: 3x⁴ divided by x gives 3x³. Multiply (x - 1) by 3x³: 3x⁴ - 3x³. Subtract this from the original polynomial:

(3x⁴ + x³ - 25x² + 38x - 17) - (3x⁴ - 3x³) = (0x⁴) + (x³ + 3x³) + (-25x²) + (38x) + (-17) = 4x³ - 25x² + 38x - 17.

Next term: 4x³ divided by x gives 4x². Multiply (x - 1) by 4x²: 4x³ - 4x². Subtract:

(4x³ - 25x² + 38x - 17) - (4x³ - 4x²) = 0x³ + (-25x² + 4x²) + 38x - 17 = -21x² + 38x - 17.

Next term: -21x² divided by x gives -21x. Multiply (x - 1) by -21x: -21x² + 21x. Subtract:

(-21x² + 38x - 17) - (-21x² + 21x) = 0x² + (38x - 21x) - 17 = 17x - 17.

Next term: 17x divided by x gives 17. Multiply (x - 1) by 17: 17x - 17. Subtract:

(17x - 17) - (17x - 17) = 0x + 0. So, there's no remainder.

Therefore, the quotient is 3x³ + 4x² - 21x + 17, which is a cubic polynomial (degree 3). Therefore, f(x) is this cubic polynomial, so its degree is 3.

Set up the coefficients: 3 (for x⁴), 1 (for x³), -25 (for x²), 38 (for x), -17 (constant term).

Bring down the 3. Multiply by 1: 3. Add to next coefficient: 1 + 3 = 4. Multiply by 1: 4. Add to next coefficient: -25 + 4 = -21. Multiply by 1: -21. Add to next coefficient: 38 + (-21) = 17. Multiply by 1: 17. Add to last coefficient: -17 +17 = 0. So, the remainder is 0, as expected. The quotient coefficients are 3, 4, -21, 17, which corresponds to 3x³ + 4x² -21x +17. This is indeed a cubic polynomial (degree 3).

Based on execution_1.1:
Therefore, since (x - 1) is a factor, when we divide the given polynomial by (x - 1), the quotient f(x) should be a cubic polynomial. Therefore, the degree of f(x) is 3.

Based on execution_1.3:
Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the synthetic division. Let me go through the synthetic division steps again:

<execution_2.1>
Start with coefficients: 3, 1, -25, 38, -17.

Bring down the 3.

Multiply 3 by 1 (the root we're testing for), get 3. Add to next coefficient: 1 + 3 = 4.

Multiply 4 by 1: 4. Add to next coefficient: -25 + 4 = -21.

Multiply -21 by 1: -21. Add to next coefficient: 38 + (-21) = 17.

Multiply 17 by 1: 17. Add to last coefficient: -17 + 17 = 0. So, yes, the quotient is 3, 4, -21, 17, and remainder 0.
