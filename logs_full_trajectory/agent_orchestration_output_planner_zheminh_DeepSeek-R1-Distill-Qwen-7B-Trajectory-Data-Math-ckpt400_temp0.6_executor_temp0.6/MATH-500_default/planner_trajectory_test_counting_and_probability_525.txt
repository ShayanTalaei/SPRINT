<Question>
In how many ways can $7$ people sit around a round table if no two of the $3$ people Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can sit next to each other? (Seating arrangements which are rotations of each other are treated as the same.)
</Question>

<think>
<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to figure out how many ways 7 people can sit around a round table, but Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can't sit next to each other. Rotations are considered the same, which is typical for circular permutations. Let me start by recalling some basics.

<prompt_1.1> Recall the formula for circular permutations and apply it to 7 people. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
First, if there were no restrictions, the number of ways to arrange 7 people around a round table is (7-1)! which is 720. That's because in circular permutations, we fix one person's position to account for rotations, and then arrange the remaining 6. So 6! = 720.
</execution_1.1>
</Execution_1>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
But here, we have restrictions: Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can't sit next to each other. So, I need to subtract the arrangements where at least two of them are sitting next to each other. Hmm, this sounds like an inclusion-exclusion problem.

<prompt_2.1> Plan how to apply the inclusion-exclusion principle to subtract cases where Pierre, Rosa, or Thomas are sitting next to each other. </prompt_2.1>

Wait, but in circular arrangements, the concept of "next to" is a bit different. When we fix one person's position, the others are arranged relative to them. So maybe I need to model this differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the inclusion-exclusion principle by considering the total number of arrangements, then subtract the ones where at least two of the restricted people are adjacent, then add back in the ones where all three are adjacent, and so on.

Let me structure this step by step.

First, total arrangements: 720.

Now, let's define the forbidden arrangements as those where at least one pair among Pierre, Rosa, Thomas are sitting next to each other. So, we need to compute the number of arrangements where at least one of the pairs (Pierre-Rosa, Rosa-Thomas, Pierre-Thomas) are sitting together, then subtract that from the total. But since some arrangements might have two pairs or all three, inclusion-exclusion is necessary.

<prompt_2.2> Define the forbidden arrangements and plan to use inclusion-exclusion to calculate them. </prompt_2.2>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
So, first, let me note the three people: let's call them P, R, T for simplicity. We need to ensure that none of the pairs (P & R), (R & T), (P & T) are sitting next to each other. 

So, perhaps the strategy is:

Total arrangements - arrangements where at least one forbidden pair is adjacent.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets: |A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A∩B| - |A∩C| - |B∩C| + |A∩B∩C|.

So, first, compute |A|, |B|, |C| where each is the number of arrangements where a specific pair is sitting together. Then subtract the pairwise intersections, then add back the triple intersection.
</execution_2.2>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.2:
First, compute |A|: number of arrangements where Pierre and Rosa are sitting next to each other. Since it's a circular table, how do we count this?

<prompt_3.1> Calculate the number of arrangements where Pierre and Rosa are sitting next to each other. </prompt_3.1>

Similarly, |B| and |C| will also be 2*5! each, since each pair is treated the same way.
So, |A| = |B| = |C| = 2*120 = 240. Therefore, the total for the first term is 3*240 = 720.

Based on execution_1.1:
But wait, if we subtract 720 from 720, we get zero, which can't be right. There must be a mistake here.

Wait, hold on.

<prompt_3.2> Verify the calculation of arrangements where Pierre and Rosa are sitting next to each other. </prompt_3.2>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
In circular permutations, if two people must sit together, we can treat them as a single entity. So, instead of 7 people, we have 6 entities (the PR pair plus the other 5 people). But since it's a circular table, the number of arrangements would be (6-1)! = 120. But since PR can be in two different orders (P next to R on the left or right), we multiply by 2. So, |A| = 2*5! = 240.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
In circular permutations, if we fix two people as a pair, we have to adjust the count accordingly. Let me think again.

If we have a pair, say P and R, sitting together. In a circular arrangement, we can treat the pair as a single entity. So, instead of 7 individuals, we have 6 entities to arrange: the PR pair, Thomas, and the other 4 people. But since the table is circular, the number of arrangements is (6-1)! = 120. However, the PR pair can be in two orders: PR or RP. So, total arrangements with P and R together is 2*120 = 240. Similarly for the other pairs. So that part seems correct.
</execution_3.2>
</Execution_3>

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.2:
But then, when we subtract these 720 arrangements from the total 720, we get zero, which is impossible because there must be some arrangements where none of the forbidden pairs are sitting together.

So, clearly, there's an error here. The problem is that when we subtract the arrangements where P and R are together, R and T are together, and P and T are together, we are overcounting the overlaps. Wait, but even before that, the total number of arrangements is 720, and the sum of |A| + |B| + |C| is 720, which would imply that all arrangements have at least one forbidden pair, which can't be true. There must be some arrangements where none of the forbidden pairs are adjacent.
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
No prompt to execute.
</Execution_4>

<Plan_5>
Based on execution_3.2, execution_4:
But why is the sum |A| + |B| + |C| equal to the total number of arrangements?

Wait, that suggests that every arrangement has at least one forbidden pair, which is not possible. For example, suppose all three restricted people are seated with at least one non-restricted person between them. Then such an arrangement would not have any forbidden pairs.

<prompt_5.1> Realize and correct the mistake in the initial approach by considering overlaps and using the inclusion-exclusion principle properly. </prompt_5.1>

Based on execution_3.1:
Wait, but let me confirm this again. Let's take a step back.

Total arrangements: 6! = 720.

Now, for |A|: number of arrangements where P and R are sitting together. As a pair.

<prompt_5.2> Re-evaluate the calculation of |A|, |B|, and |C| and confirm the total sum. </prompt_5.2>

Based on execution_3.1:
So, back to inclusion-exclusion. Let's proceed step by step.

First, compute |A|, |B|, |C|.

Each is 2*5! = 240.

Sum: 3*240 = 720.

Now, subtract the pairwise intersections |A∩B|, |A∩C|, |B∩C|. Then add back |A∩B∩C|.

So, first, compute |A∩B|: number of arrangements where both P & R are together and R & T are together. That would mean P, R, T are all sitting together in a block where P and R are adjacent and R and T are adjacent. So, effectively, P, R, T must be in a consecutive block in the order PRT or TRP.

<prompt_5.3> Calculate the intersections |A∩B|, |A∩C|, and |B∩C| using the inclusion-exclusion principle. </prompt_5.3>
</Plan_5>

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
Therefore, my approach must be wrong here. Let me try again.
</execution_5.1>

<execution_5.2>
Treated as a single entity, so 6 entities total. Circular arrangements: 5! = 120. Multiply by 2 for the two orders: 240. Similarly for |B| and |C|. So 3*240 = 720. But if all arrangements have at least one forbidden pair, then there are zero valid arrangements, which can't be right. But we know that's not the case, so there must be a mistake here.
</execution_5.2>

<execution_5.3>
Wait, if P and R are adjacent, and R and T are adjacent, then the three must be in a block where they are consecutive. So, the block can be PRT or TRP. So, two possible internal arrangements.

Then, treating this block as a single entity, we have 5 entities to arrange around the table: the PRT block and the other 4 people. So, in circular permutations, that's (5-1)! = 24. Multiply by 2 for the two possible orders (PRT and TRP). So, |A∩B| = 2*24 = 48.

Similarly, |A∩C|: P & R together and P & T together. If both P is adjacent to R and T, then P must be between R and T. So, the block would be RPT or TPR. Again, two possible internal arrangements. Then, treating the block as a single entity, we have 5 entities, so (5-1)! = 24. Multiply by 2: 48. Similarly for |B∩C|: R & T together and P & T together. So, T is between R and P. The block would be RT P or P TR. Wait, similar logic: if T is adjacent to both R and P, then the block is RPT or TPR. Wait, same as before. So, yes, each pairwise intersection where two pairs share a common person (like A∩B where both share R, or A∩C where both share P, etc.) would result in a block of three people in a specific order. Therefore, each |A∩B|, |A∩C|, |B∩C| is 48. So, three intersections, each 48. So total 3*48 = 144.

Now, the triple intersection |A∩B∩C|: arrangements where all three pairs are adjacent. That is, P, R, T are all sitting next to each other in a way that each pair is adjacent. Wait, but in a circular table, how can all three pairs be adjacent? If P, R, T are all sitting together in a block where each is adjacent to the other two. That would require them to be in a consecutive sequence where each is next to the other two. But in a linear block, that's only possible if they are in a cycle. But since it's a circular table, the only way all three pairs are adjacent is if they form a triangle, which isn't possible in a linear arrangement. Wait, no. Wait, in a circular table, if P, R, T are seated consecutively in the order P-R-T-P, but since it's a single block, they form a triangle? Hmm, maybe not. Let's think.

Wait, if all three are sitting together in a block, then each of them is adjacent to two others. For example, in a block of P-R-T, P is adjacent to R and T (if it's a circular block). Wait, no. In a linear block, P is adjacent to R, R is adjacent to P and T, T is adjacent to R. But in a circular block, the ends are adjacent. Wait, no. If we have a block of three people in a circular table, the block is linear: P-R-T, but in the context of the entire table, the block is just three consecutive seats. So, in that case, P is adjacent to R and the person before the block, R is adjacent to P and T, T is adjacent to R and the person after the block. So, in this case, R is adjacent to both P and T, but P and T are not adjacent. So, to have all three pairs (P-R, R-T, P-T) adjacent, we need P and T to be adjacent as well. That would require the three to be arranged in a triangle, which isn't possible in a linear arrangement. Therefore, in a circular table, it's impossible for all three pairs (P-R, R-T, P-T) to be adjacent simultaneously. Therefore, |A∩B∩C| = 0.

Wait, but let me verify. Suppose we have a block of three people where P is next to R, R is next to T, and T is next to P. That would form a triangle, which is not possible in a linear arrangement. Therefore, such an arrangement can't exist. Therefore, there are no seating arrangements where all three pairs are adjacent. Hence, |A∩B∩C| = 0.

Therefore, applying inclusion-exclusion:

Number of arrangements with at least one forbidden pair = |A ∪ B ∪ C| = 720 - 144 + 0 = 576.

Wait, inclusion-exclusion formula is |A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A∩B| - |A∩C| - |B∩C| + |A∩B∩C|.

So, substituting the numbers:

|A ∪ B ∪ C| = 720 - 144 + 0 = 576.

Therefore, the number of valid arrangements is total arrangements minus this: 720 - 576 = 144.

But wait, that seems low. Let me check again.
</execution_5.3>
</Execution_5>

<Plan_6>
Based on execution_5.3:
So, total forbidden arrangements: 720 (from |A| + |B| + |C|) minus 144 (from the intersections) = 576. Therefore, allowed arrangements: 720 - 576 = 144.

But let me check if this is correct. Let's see.

<prompt_6.1> Verify the result by considering an example with fewer people. </prompt_6.1>
</Plan_6>

<Execution_6>
<execution_6.1>
For example, if there were 3 people: Pierre, Rosa, Thomas. Then, seating them around a table with no two of them sitting together. But since there are only three people, and we need to seat all three, but Pierre, Rosa, Thomas can't sit next to each other. But in a circular table with 3 seats, each person is adjacent to the other two. So, it's impossible. So, the answer would be 0. Let's see if our formula gives that.

Total arrangements: (3-1)! = 2. Forbidden arrangements: |A ∪ B ∪ C|. Each |A|, |B|, |C| would be 2*1! = 2. So, |A| + |B| + |C| = 6. Then, |A∩B|: arrangements where P & R and R & T are together. That would require all three in a block, which is only 2 arrangements (since circular). So, |A∩B| = 2. Similarly for |A∩C| and |B∩C|, each 2. So, total intersections: 3*2=6. Then |A∩B∩C|: arrangements where all three pairs are adjacent. Which is 2. So, |A ∪ B ∪ C| = 6 - 6 + 2 = 2. So, allowed arrangements: 2 - 2 = 0. Correct.

Another test case: 4 people, Pierre, Rosa, Thomas, and another person. Let's say we want to arrange them so that Pierre, Rosa, Thomas are not adjacent. Let's compute.

Total arrangements: (4-1)! = 6.

Forbidden arrangements: arrangements where at least two of P, R, T are adjacent.

Compute |A|: arrangements with P & R together: 2*2! = 4. Similarly |B| and |C| (but here, C would be P & T together). Wait, but with 4 people, if we have P & T together, that's also 2*2! = 4.

Intersections: |A∩B|: P & R and R & T together. That would form a block of PRT or TRP. Then, treating as a single entity with the fourth person. So, 2 blocks, each with (3-1)! = 1 arrangement. Wait, circular arrangements with two entities: 1. So, total |A∩B| = 2*1 = 2. Similarly, |A∩C|: P & R and P & T together. That would form a block of PRT or TRP, same as before. So, 2*1 = 2. Similarly, |B∩C|: arrangements where R & T and P & T are together. That would also form the same block. So, 2*1 = 2. So, total intersections: 3*2=6.

|A∩B∩C|: arrangements where all three pairs are adjacent. That would require P, R, T all adjacent in a block. So, blocks PRT or TRP. Then, with the fourth person, we have two entities: the block and the fourth person. Circular arrangements: (2-1)! = 1. Multiply by 2 for the block orders. So, 2*1=2. So, |A∩B∩C|=2.

Thus, |A ∪ B ∪ C| = 4+4+4 - 2-2-2 + 2 = 12 - 6 + 2 = 8. Wait, but total arrangements are 6. This is impossible. So, clearly, something's wrong here. Wait, this suggests that the inclusion-exclusion is being applied incorrectly.

Wait, in this case, total arrangements are 6, but the forbidden arrangements can't exceed 6. However, according to the calculation, |A ∪ B ∪ C| = 8, which is impossible. Therefore, there must be an error in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps in the intersections. Let's re-examine |A∩B| where A is P & R together and B is R & T together. So, if both P & R and R & T are together, then P, R, T must form a consecutive block in the order PRT or TRP. Then, the fourth person is separate. So, treating the block as a single entity, we have two entities: the block and the fourth person. In circular arrangements, the number of ways to arrange two entities is (2-1)! = 1. So, for each block order (PRT or TRP), we have 1 arrangement. So, total |A∩B| = 2*1 = 2. Similarly for the others. Then, |A∩B∩C|: all three pairs together. That would require P, R, T to form a block where each is adjacent to the other two. As before, that's only possible if they are in a linear block, but in a circular table with four seats, the block is linear. So, the block PRT is adjacent to the fourth person, so P is adjacent to R and the fourth person, R is adjacent to P and T, T is adjacent to R and the fourth person. Therefore, P and T are not adjacent. Therefore, to have all three pairs adjacent, P and T must also be adjacent, which they aren't in this arrangement. Therefore, |A∩B∩C| = 0. Then, recalculate:

|A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A∩B| - |A∩C| - |B∩C| + |A∩B∩C| = 4 + 4 + 4 - 2 - 2 - 2 + 0 = 12 - 6 = 6. Therefore, forbidden arrangements = 6, total arrangements = 6, so allowed = 0. Which makes sense, because in a circular table with four people, if you have three people who can't sit next to each other, then arranging them such that none are adjacent is impossible. For example, place Pierre, Rosa, Thomas around the table; with four seats, one seat must be between two of them, making them adjacent. Therefore, the answer is indeed 0. So, in this case, the inclusion-exclusion works if we correctly compute the intersections as 2 each and triple intersection as 0. Therefore, returning to the original problem, perhaps the intersections are indeed 48 each, and the triple intersection is 0, leading to 144 forbidden arrangements, so allowed = 720 - 144 = 576. But in the four-person example, if we applied the same method, we would get the correct answer. Therefore, perhaps the original calculation is correct.

But let's verify with another approach. Let's consider arranging the non-restricted people first.
</execution_6.1>
</Execution_6>

<Plan_7>
Based on execution_6.1:
Since Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas are restricted, perhaps we can first seat the other four people and then place Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas in the gaps.

<prompt_7.1> Explore an alternative approach using seating the non-restricted people first and verify if it leads to the same result. </prompt_7.1>
</Plan_7>

<Execution_7>
<execution_7.1>
In circular arrangements, the number of gaps between people is equal to the number of people. So, seating four people around a table creates four gaps. Wait, but in circular arrangements, the number of gaps is equal to the number of people. So, if we seat four people, there are four gaps between them. Then, we can place Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas in these gaps such that no two of them are adjacent. 

But we have three people to place in four gaps, with no two in the same gap (since that would make them adjacent). So, the number of ways would be C(4,3) * 3! = 4 * 6 = 24. But then, the four people can be arranged in 4! ways, but since it's a circular table, we need to fix one person's position. Wait, perhaps this approach is different.

Wait, let me think again. If we first seat the four unrestricted people around the table, considering rotations as the same. So, fix one person's position to account for rotational symmetry. Then, the remaining three unrestricted people can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways. Then, there are four gaps between them (since it's a circular table with four people, there are four gaps). We need to place Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas into these gaps, one in three of the gaps, with no two of them adjacent. So, choosing three gaps out of four: C(4,3) = 4. Then, arranging Pierre, Rosa, Thomas in those gaps: 3! = 6. So, total ways: 6 (arrangements of unrestricted) * 4 * 6 = 6*24 = 144. Which matches the previous result of 144. Therefore, this confirms that the answer is 144. 

Therefore, the number of valid arrangements is 144.

</Execution_7>

<Plan_8>
Based on execution_7.1:
But let me just make sure there are no mistakes here. Let's verify again.

<prompt_8.1> Verify the calculations and confirm the result is consistent with the inclusion-exclusion principle. </prompt_8.1>
</Plan_8>

<Execution_8>
<execution_8.1>
First approach: total arrangements 6! = 720. Forbidden arrangements calculated as 576, so allowed = 144.

Second approach: seat four unrestricted people first (fix one, arrange the other three: 3! = 6). Then, place Pierre, Rosa, Thomas in the four gaps: choose three gaps (C(4,3) = 4), arrange the three people in those gaps (3! = 6). So, 6*4*6 = 144. 

Consistent results. Therefore, the answer is 144. 

But let me check if there's any oversight. For example, when seating the four unrestricted people, are we overcounting? Because in the first approach, we considered all arrangements and subtracted the forbidden ones, while in the second approach, we construct the valid arrangements directly. Let's see.

In the second approach, we fix one person's seat to eliminate rotational symmetry. Then arrange the other three unrestricted people in 3! ways. Then, place the restricted people in the gaps. This seems correct. 

Alternatively, another way to think about it is:

Total valid arrangements = (arrangements with no two of P, R, T adjacent) = total arrangements - arrangements with at least one pair adjacent. Which is exactly what the inclusion-exclusion does. 

But in the four-person example, when we applied the same logic, it worked. So, the same should apply here. 

Therefore, the answer is 144.

Based on execution_8.1:
But let me just confirm once more with another perspective.

<prompt_9.1> Provide a final verification of the result using another perspective and conclude with the final answer. </prompt_9.1>
</Plan_9>

<Execution_9>
<execution_9.1>
Suppose we model the problem as arranging the four unrestricted people first, creating four slots for the restricted ones. Then, placing P, R, T in three of these slots. The number of ways is indeed 4P3 * 3! = 24 * 6 = 144. 

Alternatively, using inclusion-exclusion, we arrived at the same number. Therefore, the answer is 144. 

So, the final answer is 144, which is 12^2, but that's irrelevant. 

Thus, the number of ways is 144. 

**Final Answer**
The number of valid seating arrangements is \boxed{144}.

Therefore, the number of ways $7$ people can sit around a round table such that no two of the $3$ people Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can sit next to each other is $\boxed{144}$.
