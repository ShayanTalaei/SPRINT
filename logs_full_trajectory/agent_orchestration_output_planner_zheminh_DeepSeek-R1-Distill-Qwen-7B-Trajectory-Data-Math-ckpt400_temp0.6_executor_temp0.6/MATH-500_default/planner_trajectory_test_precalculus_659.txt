Okay, so I need to find the equation of the plane that contains three points: (0, -1, -1), (-4, 4, 4), and (4, 5, 1). Hmm, let me recall how to do this. I think the general equation of a plane is Ax + By + Cz + D = 0, and I need to find A, B, C, D such that all three points satisfy this equation. Also, the coefficients should be integers with the greatest common divisor 1 and A > 0. Alright, let's start breaking this down.

First, maybe I should find two vectors that lie on the plane. Since the plane is defined by three points, I can take vectors between these points. Let me label the points for clarity: let’s say P1 is (0, -1, -1), P2 is (-4, 4, 4), and P3 is (4, 5, 1).

So, if I take vectors from P1 to P2 and from P1 to P3, those should lie on the plane. Let me compute those vectors.

<prompt_1.1> Calculate the vectors from P1 to P2 and from P1 to P3. </prompt_1.1>

Alternatively, maybe I can use the determinant method to find the plane equation. Let me try that approach to verify.

The determinant method for a plane given three points P1(x1, y1, z1), P2(x2, y2, z2), P3(x3, y3, z3) is:

</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
Vector P1P2 = P2 - P1 = (-4 - 0, 4 - (-1), 4 - (-1)) = (-4, 5, 5).

Vector P1P3 = P3 - P1 = (4 - 0, 5 - (-1), 1 - (-1)) = (4, 6, 2).

Based on execution_1.1:
Now, the normal vector to the plane can be found by taking the cross product of these two vectors. The cross product will give a vector perpendicular to both, which is the normal vector (A, B, C).

<prompt_2.1> Compute the cross product of the vectors P1P2 and P1P3 to find the normal vector. </prompt_2.1>

Based on execution_1.2:
But since we have three points, the determinant method for three points in the plane can be set up by expanding the determinant. Let me set up the determinant with variables x, y, z, and 1.

<prompt_2.2> Expand the determinant using the alternative method to find the plane equation. </prompt_2.2>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Let me compute the cross product P1P2 × P1P3.

The cross product formula is:

If vector v = (v1, v2, v3) and vector w = (w1, w2, w3), then v × w = (v2w3 - v3w2, v3w1 - v1w3, v1w2 - v2w1).

So applying that here:

First component: (5)(2) - (5)(6) = 10 - 30 = -20.

Second component: (5)(4) - (-4)(2) = 20 - (-8) = 28. Wait, hold on, the cross product formula for the second component is actually (v3w1 - v1w3). Let me recast it properly.

Wait, maybe I should write it step by step.

Given vectors:

P1P2 = (-4, 5, 5)

P1P3 = (4, 6, 2)

So cross product is:

|i   j   k|
|-4  5   5|
|4   6   2|

Calculating the determinant:

i*(5*2 - 5*6) - j*(-4*2 - 5*4) + k*(-4*6 - 5*4)

Compute each component:

i: (10 - 30) = -20

j: - [(-8 - 20)] = - (-28) = 28

k: (-24 - 20) = -44

So the cross product is (-20, 28, -44).
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
The determinant would be:

| 0   -1   -1   1 |
| -4  4    4    1 |
| 4   5    1    1 |
| x   y    z   1 |

But actually, the standard method is to use the point-normal form. Since we have three points, another way is to use the determinant formula for a plane:

Given three points, the equation of the plane can be found by the determinant:

| x   y   z   1 |
| x1  y1  z1  1 |
| x2  y2  z2  1 |
| x3  y3  z3  1 |

But expanding this determinant should give the plane equation. Let me try expanding this determinant.

However, since we already did the cross product method and got the same result, and verified with plugging in the points, I think this is correct.

So the normal vector n is (-20, 28, -44).

But the plane equation requires A, B, C to be integers such that gcd of |A|, |B|, |C|, |D| is 1 and A > 0. Let me check if this normal vector can be simplified.

First, check if the components have a common divisor.

Based on execution_2.2:
Wait, but maybe I should check once more. Let me take another approach.

20, 28, 44. Let's see: 20 and 28 have a gcd of 4. Then 4 and 44 have gcd 4. So the gcd of 20, 28, 44 is 4. But since the normal vector here is (-20, 28, -44), the gcd is 4 as well. However, we need the gcd of A, B, C, D to be 1. So we need to divide the equation by 4, but also ensure that A is positive.

Wait, but first, let's write the plane equation using the normal vector. The general equation is A(x - x0) + B(y - y0) + C(z - z0) = 0, where (x0, y0, z0) is a point on the plane. Let's use point P1 (0, -1, -1).

So plugging in:

-20(x - 0) + 28(y - (-1)) - 44(z - (-1)) = 0

Simplify:

-20x + 28(y + 1) - 44(z + 1) = 0

Expanding:

-20x + 28y + 28 - 44z - 44 = 0

Combine constants:

-20x + 28y - 44z - 16 = 0

Now, let's rearrange to make A positive. The coefficient of x is -20. If we multiply the entire equation by -1, we get:

20x - 28y + 44z + 16 = 0

So now, A = 20, B = -28, C = 44, D = 16.

<execution_3.2>
Let's say, finding the equation using two vectors and a point. Let's use P1 as the point on the plane. The two vectors from P1 are (-4,5,5) and (4,6,2). The normal vector is (-20,28,-44). So the plane equation is -20(x - 0) + 28(y + 1) -44(z + 1) = 0. Wait, that's another way to write it. Let me expand that.

-20x + 28(y + 1) -44(z + 1) = 0

=> -20x + 28y + 28 -44z -44 = 0

=> -20x +28y -44z -16 = 0

Multiply both sides by -1: 20x -28y +44z +16 =0

But this is the same as before, just multiplied by -1. So if we write 20x -28y +44z +16 =0, but the problem requires A>0 and gcd 1. However, in our original calculation, we had normal vector (-20,28,-44), leading to equation -20x +28y -44z + D =0. Then we found D= -16. So the equation is -20x +28y -44z -16=0. Then we multiplied by -1 to make A positive, resulting in 20x -28y +44z +16=0. But gcd(20,28,44,16). Let's compute gcd step by step.

gcd(20,28)=4, gcd(4,44)=4, gcd(4,16)=4. So gcd is 4. Therefore, we can divide the entire equation by 4: 5x -7y +11z +4=0.

Wait, this is different from before. So here, if we take the normal vector (-20,28,-44), which gives the equation -20x +28y -44z -16=0. Then multiplying by -1 gives 20x -28y +44z +16=0. Then, if we divide by 4, we get 5x -7y +11z +4=0. Let me check if this is equivalent.

Yes, because 20x -28y +44z +16=0 divided by 4 is 5x -7y +11z +4=0. So this is the same plane equation. So this would be the simplified form with gcd 1. But wait, in the initial cross product method, we had D= -16, so the equation was -20x +28y -44z -16=0. Then multiplying by -1 gives 20x -28y +44z +16=0. Then dividing by 4 gives 5x -7y +11z +4=0. So that's the simplified version.

But in the first approach, when I found D by plugging into the equation, I had -20x +28y -44z -16=0. So that's the same as 5x -7y +11z +4=0 multiplied by -4. Wait, no. Wait, 5x -7y +11z +4=0 multiplied by 4 is 20x -28y +44z +16=0, which is the same as before. So actually, all these equations are equivalent. So the reduced form is 5x -7y +11z +4=0. However, in the problem statement, they require A>0 and gcd 1. Here, in 5x -7y +11z +4=0, A=5, which is greater than 0, and gcd(5,7,11,4)=1, since 5,7,11 are primes and 4 shares no common factors with them. So this is the required form. Therefore, the answer is 5x -7y +11z +4=0.

But wait, in my initial calculation, I had D= -16 in the equation -20x +28y -44z -16=0. So if we divide by -4, we get 5x -7y +11z +4=0. So that's correct. Therefore, the final equation is 5x -7y +11z +4=0. Let me check again by plugging in the points.

Compute gcd of 20, 28, 44, 16.

Factors:

20: 2^2 * 5

28: 2^2 *7

44: 2^2 *11

16: 2^4

So the common factor is 2^2 = 4. But we need gcd 1. So we need to divide the entire equation by 4? Wait, but if we divide by 4, we get 5x -7y +11z +4 = 0. Let me check:

20 ÷ 4 = 5

28 ÷ 4 = 7

44 ÷ 4 = 11

16 ÷ 4 = 4

So the equation becomes 5x -7y +11z +4 = 0.

Now, check gcd of 5,7,11,4. The gcd of 5 and 7 is 1, so the gcd of all four is 1.

Good.

For P2 (-4,4,4): 5*(-4) -7*4 +11*4 +4 = -20 -28 +44 +4 = (-20-28) + (44+4) = -48 +48 = 0.

For P3 (4,5,1): 5*4 -7*5 +11*1 +4 = 20 -35 +11 +4 = (20+11+4) -35 = 35 -35 = 0.

Perfect, all points satisfy the equation. Also, the coefficients are 5, -7, 11, 4. The gcd of 5,7,11,4 is 1, since 5 and 7 are coprime, 11 is prime and doesn't divide into any of them, and 4 shares no common factors with them. And A=5 is positive. So this satisfies all the conditions.
