Okay, let's see. I need to evaluate log base 2 of 64. Hmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but maybe if I break it down step by step, it will make more sense. So, log base 2 of 64 is asking the question: "2 raised to what power gives 64"? Right? Because logarithms are the inverse of exponentials. So if I can figure out the exponent that turns 2 into 64, that's my answer.

Let me start by recalling the powers of 2.

<prompt_1.1> Recall the powers of 2 up to 2^6 and determine the exponent that results in 64. </prompt_1.1>

2^1 is 2, right? Then 2^2 is 4, 2^3 is 8, 2^4 is 16, 2^5 is 32, and 2^6 is 64. Wait, so 2 to the sixth power is 64. That means the logarithm base 2 of 64 is 6. So is the answer 6?

Based on execution_1.1:
But let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. Maybe there's a different way to approach this problem in case I made a mistake in my initial calculation.

Another method could be using the change of base formula.

<prompt_2.1> Use the change of base formula to verify the solution by calculating log base 10 of 64 divided by log base 10 of 2. </prompt_2.1>

Alternatively, I could use natural logarithm instead of base 10.

<prompt_2.2> Use the natural logarithm to verify the solution by calculating ln(64) divided by ln(2). </prompt_2.2>

Wait, maybe I can also think about this in terms of binary. Since log base 2 is related to how many bits are needed to represent a number.

<prompt_2.3> Explain the relationship between log base 2 and binary representation to verify the solution. </prompt_2.3>

Is there a possibility that the answer could be negative or a fraction? Let me think. 

Since 64 is a positive number, and 2 is greater than 1, the logarithm should be a positive number.

<prompt_2.4> Analyze the possibility of the answer being negative or a fraction for log base 2 of 64. </prompt_2.4>

Another check: maybe express 64 as a power of 2 in another way. For example, 64 is 8 squared, which is (2^3)^2 = 2^(3*2) = 2^6.

<prompt_2.5> Express 64 as a power of 2 in another way and verify the solution. </prompt_2.5>

<execution_2.1>
The change of base formula states that log base a of b can be written as log base c of b divided by log base c of a, right? So in this case, log base 2 of 64 can be written as log base 10 of 64 divided by log base 10 of 2. If I calculate that, maybe I can verify if it's 6.

But wait, I don't have a calculator here, but I can approximate. Let's see. Log base 10 of 2 is approximately 0.3010. Log base 10 of 64 is log base 10 of 64. Hmm, 64 is 6.4 times 10, so log10(64) = log10(6.4) + 1. Log10(6.4) is somewhere around 0.806 because 10^0.8 is about 6.3. So log10(64) is approximately 1.806. Then dividing that by 0.3010 gives roughly 1.806 / 0.3010 ≈ 6. So that still gives 6.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
The change of base formula says that log base a of b is equal to log base c of b divided by log base c of a, right? So, using that formula, log₂64 would be ln(64)/ln(2). Let me compute that. 

First, ln(64) is the natural logarithm of 64. I know that 64 is 2^6, so ln(64) is ln(2^6) which is 6*ln(2). Then, ln(2) is just ln(2). So, dividing them would give 6*ln(2)/ln(2) = 6. So that also gives 6.
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
For example, 64 in binary is 1000000, which is 2^6. So the number of bits minus one is 6, which again corresponds to the exponent. So that's another way to confirm that the answer is 6.
</execution_2.3>

<execution_2.4>
If I recall, logarithms of numbers greater than 1 with bases greater than 1 are positive. So 64 is definitely greater than 1, so the answer can't be negative or a fraction. It has to be a whole number.

Wait, but just to be thorough, if I consider that maybe 2 raised to a fractional exponent could give 64. For example, 2^(n) = 64. If n were a fraction, like 6.5, then 2^6.5 is sqrt(2^13) which is sqrt(8192) which is way more than 64. So no, it's not possible. So n has to be an integer.
</execution_2.4>

<execution_2.5>
So that still gives 2^6, so the exponent is 6. 

Alternatively, if I use the change of base formula, log_b a = log_c a / log_c b. So if I choose base 10, then log2(64) = log10(64) / log10(2). I can approximate log10(64). Since 10^1 = 10, 10^1.8 = 63.095... (since 10^0.8 is about 6.3095), so log10(64) is approximately 1.806. And log10(2) is about 0.3010. So dividing 1.806 by 0.3010 gives approximately 6. So that also gives 6.

Based on execution_2.1, execution_2.2, execution_2.3, execution_2.4, execution_2.5:
I think I've verified this through multiple methods: direct computation of powers of 2, using the change of base formula with different logarithms, and even a binary perspective.

<prompt_3.1> Conclude the solution by summarizing the verification methods and stating the final answer. </prompt_3.1>

All lead to the same conclusion. 

Just to recap: log₂64 asks for the exponent that turns 2 into 64. Since 2^6 = 64, the exponent is 6. Using the change of base formula with approximate values also confirms this. Also, expressing 64 as 2^6 in different forms (like (2^3)^2) still results in 2^6. So there's no ambiguity here.
