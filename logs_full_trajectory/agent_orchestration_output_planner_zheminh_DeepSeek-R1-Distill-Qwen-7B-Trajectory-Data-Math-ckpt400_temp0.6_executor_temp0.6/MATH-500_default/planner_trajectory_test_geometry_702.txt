To reduce the total length of rope used, rope $HC$ and rope $HD$ are to be replaced by a single rope $HP$ where $P$ is a point on the straight line between $C$ and $D$. (The balloon remains at the same position $H$ above $O$ as described above.)  Determine the greatest length of rope that can be saved.
</Question>

<think>
<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to figure out how to save the maximum amount of rope by replacing ropes HC and HD with a single rope HP, where P is somewhere between points C and D. The balloon is still at point H above O. Let me start by visualizing the setup.

<prompt_1.1> Visualize the setup and identify the goal of the problem. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
There are five points: A, B, C, D, and O. O is the central point where all the directions are given—A is north, B is west, C is south, D is east. The distance between C and D is 140 meters. The hot-air balloon is at point H directly above O. The ropes HA, HB, HC, and HD are holding the balloon. HC is 150 meters, and HD is 130 meters. The problem is asking to replace HC and HD with a single rope HP, where P is somewhere on the line between C and D. The goal is to find the maximum rope saved.
</execution_1.1>
</Execution_1>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
First, let me recall that the original total length of ropes HC and HD is 150 + 130 = 280 meters. If we replace them with a single rope HP, the new length will be the length of HP. So, the amount saved will be 280 - HP. Therefore, to maximize the saved rope, we need to minimize the length of HP. Wait, but the problem says "the greatest length of rope that can be saved". So, yes, we need to find the minimal possible HP such that P is on the line segment CD. Then subtract that minimal HP from 280 to get the saved length.

But let me confirm: The balloon is at H, which is directly above O. So, points C and D are on the ground, with C directly south of O and D directly east of O. Wait, hold on.

<prompt_2.1> Confirm the position of point H and its relation to points C and D. </prompt_2.1>
-----

But let me confirm if there's any error in my reasoning. For example, is there a possibility that the minimal HP is not when P is somewhere between C and D?

<prompt_2.2> Verify the solution by considering the geometry of the problem. </prompt_2.2>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Wait, the problem says: "B is directly west of O", "C is directly south of O", and "D is directly east of O". So, O is the center. Then, points A, B, C, D are at the four cardinal directions from O. However, the distance between C and D is given as 140 meters. Wait, C is south of O, and D is east of O. So, the distance between C and D is the straight line distance between those two points. If O is the origin, then C is (0, -c) and D is (d, 0), but the straight line distance between C and D would be sqrt((d - 0)^2 + (0 - (-c))^2) = sqrt(d^2 + c^2). So that's given as 140 meters. So, sqrt(c^2 + d^2) = 140.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Wait, but the problem states that P must be on the straight line between C and D. So, the line CD is a straight line from C to D. Since C is south of O and D is east of O, the line CD is a diagonal line from south to east. However, O is the point where all the directions are given. Wait, O is the point directly below H. So, H is vertically above O. Therefore, the points C and D are on the ground, with coordinates (if we consider O as the origin) C at (0, -c, 0) and D at (d, 0, 0), but actually, since the distance between C and D is 140 meters. Wait, hold on. If O is the center, then C is directly south, D is directly east. So, if we model this on a coordinate system, let’s set O at (0, 0, 0). Then, H is at (0, 0, h) for some height h. Then, A is north of O, so A is (0, a, 0), B is west of O, so B is (-b, 0, 0), C is south of O, so C is (0, -c, 0), and D is east of O, so D is (d, 0, 0). The distance between C and D is 140 meters. Since C is (0, -c, 0) and D is (d, 0, 0), the distance CD is sqrt((d - 0)^2 + (0 - (-c))^2) = sqrt(d² + c²) = 140. So, c² + d² = 140² = 19600. That's one equation.

Then, the ropes HC and HD have lengths 150 and 130 meters. Rope HC is from H(0,0,h) to C(0, -c, 0). The length of HC is sqrt((0 - 0)^2 + (-c - 0)^2 + (0 - h)^2) = sqrt(c² + h²) = 150. Similarly, rope HD is from H(0,0,h) to D(d, 0, 0). Its length is sqrt((d - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2 + (0 - h)^2) = sqrt(d² + h²) = 130. Therefore, we have two equations:

1. sqrt(c² + h²) = 150 → c² + h² = 22500
2. sqrt(d² + h²) = 130 → d² + h² = 16900

And we also have c² + d² = 19600.
</execution_2.2>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
The balloon is at H, which is vertically above O, so the coordinates of H would be (0, 0, k) for some height k. The ropes HA, HB, HC, HD are all anchored at H to the respective points on the ground.

<prompt_3.1> Set up the coordinate system and equations for the problem. </prompt_3.1>
-----

Based on execution_2.2:
So, let's write these equations:

From equation 2: d² = 19600 - c² (since c² + d² = 19600). Then plug into equation 2:

<prompt_3.2> Solve the equations to find the height h of the balloon. </prompt_3.2>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
The problem is in three dimensions, but since all points are in a plane (assuming the field is flat and horizontal), we can model this in 2D with coordinates. Let me set up a coordinate system where O is the origin (0, 0). Then, since A is north of O, B is west, C is south, D is east. So, in this coordinate system:

- O is (0, 0)
- A is (0, a) for some a > 0 (north)
- B is (-b, 0) for some b > 0 (west)
- C is (0, -c) for some c > 0 (south)
- D is (d, 0) for some d > 0 (east)

The distance between C and D is given as 140 m. Since C is (0, -c) and D is (d, 0), the distance between them is sqrt[(d - 0)^2 + (0 - (-c))^2] = sqrt(d² + c²) = 140. So, we have:

d² + c² = 140² = 19600.  [Equation 1]

The balloon is at H directly above O, so H is (0, 0, h) for some height h. The lengths of the ropes are given as HC = 150 m and HD = 130 m. Let's write the equations for these lengths.

Rope HC connects H(0, 0, h) to C(0, -c, 0). The length of HC is sqrt[(0 - 0)^2 + (-c - 0)^2 + (0 - h)^2] = sqrt(c² + h²) = 150. Therefore:

c² + h² = 150² = 22500.  [Equation 2]

Similarly, rope HD connects H(0, 0, h) to D(d, 0, 0). Its length is sqrt[(d - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2 + (0 - h)^2] = sqrt(d² + h²) = 130. Therefore:

d² + h² = 130² = 16900.  [Equation 3]

So, we have three equations:

1. d² + c² = 19600
2. c² + h² = 22500
3. d² + h² = 16900
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
d² + h² = 16900 → (19600 - c²) + h² = 16900 → h² = 16900 - 19600 + c² = c² - 2700.

From equation 1: c² + h² = 22500. Substitute h² from above: c² + (c² - 2700) = 22500 → 2c² - 2700 = 22500 → 2c² = 25200 → c² = 12600 → c = sqrt(12600) = sqrt(126 * 100) = 10 * sqrt(126) ≈ 112.25 meters.

Then h² = c² - 2700 = 12600 - 2700 = 9900 → h = sqrt(9900) = sqrt(100 * 99) = 10 * sqrt(99) ≈ 99.4987 meters.

Based on execution_3.2:
Now, we need to find the minimal length of HP where P is on the line segment CD. Let's parametrize point P on CD.

<prompt_4.1> Find the point P on line segment CD that minimizes the length of HP. </prompt_4.1>
-----

Based on execution_3.1:
So, we can solve these equations. Let me subtract equation 3 from equation 2:

<prompt_4.2> Solve the equations to find the values of c, d, and h. </prompt_4.2>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
Since C is (0, -c) and D is (d, 0), the line CD can be parametrized. Let me find the parametric equations for line CD. The vector from C to D is (d - 0, 0 - (-c)) = (d, c). So, parametric equations for CD can be written as:

Starting at C(0, -c), moving towards D(d, 0). Let parameter t go from 0 to 1.

So, any point P on CD can be expressed as:

x = 0 + d*t

y = -c + c*t

So, P = (d*t, -c + c*t) where t ∈ [0, 1].

Alternatively, we can write P as (d*t, c*(-1 + t)).

Then, the coordinates of P are (d*t, c*(t - 1)).

Now, the length of HP is the distance from H(0, 0, h) to P(d*t, c*(t - 1), 0). So, in 3D space, the distance HP is:

HP = sqrt[(d*t - 0)^2 + (c*(t - 1) - 0)^2 + (0 - h)^2]

Simplify:

HP = sqrt[(d*t)^2 + (c*(t - 1))^2 + h²]

We need to find the value of t in [0, 1] that minimizes HP. Since the square root function is monotonically increasing, minimizing HP is equivalent to minimizing the square of HP, which is:

HP² = (d*t)^2 + (c*(t - 1))^2 + h²

Let me denote this as f(t):

f(t) = (d²*t²) + (c²*(t - 1)^2) + h²

We need to find the minimum of f(t) over t ∈ [0, 1].

First, let's expand f(t):

f(t) = d²*t² + c²*(t² - 2t + 1) + h²

= (d² + c²)*t² - 2c²*t + c² + h²

But from equation 1, we know that d² + c² = 19600. So:

f(t) = 19600*t² - 2c²*t + c² + h²

Now, to find the minimum of this quadratic function in t, we can take the derivative with respect to t and set it to zero.

But since it's a quadratic function, the minimum occurs at the vertex of the parabola. The vertex is at t = -b/(2a) where the quadratic is in the form a*t² + b*t + c. Here, a = 19600, b = -2c². So:

t = (2c²)/(2*19600) = c² / 19600

But we need to check if this t is within the interval [0, 1]. If it is, then this is the minimizing t; otherwise, the minimum occurs at t=0 or t=1.

So, first, compute t = c² / 19600. Let's recall from earlier, c² = 12600.

Therefore, t = 12600 / 19600 = 126/196 = 9/14 ≈ 0.6429, which is between 0 and 1. Therefore, the minimum occurs at t = 9/14.

Therefore, the minimal HP² is f(9/14). Let's compute that.

First, compute f(t) at t = 9/14:

f(9/14) = 19600*(9/14)^2 - 2c²*(9/14) + c² + h²

First, compute each term:

1. 19600*(81/196) = 19600*(81)/196 = 100*81 = 8100

2. -2c²*(9/14) = -2*12600*(9/14) = -25200*(9/14) = -1800*9 = -16200

3. c² + h² = 12600 + 9900 = 22500

Therefore, adding them up:

8100 - 16200 + 22500 = (8100 - 16200) + 22500 = (-8100) + 22500 = 14400

Therefore, HP² = 14400, so HP = sqrt(14400) = 120 meters.

Therefore, the minimal length of HP is 120 meters. The original total length of HC and HD was 150 + 130 = 280 meters. So, the rope saved is 280 - 120 = 160 meters.
</execution_4.1>

<execution_4.2>
(c² + h²) - (d² + h²) = 22500 - 16900 → c² - d² = 5600.  [Equation 4]

But from equation 1, we have c² + d² = 19600. [Equation 1]

So, we can solve equations 1 and 4:

From equation 4: c² = d² + 5600.

Plug into equation 1: (d² + 5600) + d² = 19600 → 2d² + 5600 = 19600 → 2d² = 14000 → d² = 7000 → d = sqrt(7000) ≈ 83.666 meters.

Then c² = 7000 + 5600 = 12600 → c = sqrt(12600) ≈ 112.25 meters. Then from equation 3: d² + h² = 16900 → 7000 + h² = 16900 → h² = 9900 → h = sqrt(9900) ≈ 99.4987 meters. So, the height of H above O is approximately 99.5 meters.

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
First, c² = 12600, so t = c² / 19600 = 12600 / 19600 = 9/14 ≈ 0.6429.

Then, f(t) at t = 9/14:

19600*(9/14)^2: Let's compute (9/14)^2 = 81/196. Then 19600*(81/196) = (19600 / 196)*81 = 100*81 = 8100.

Then, -2c²*(9/14) = -2*12600*(9/14) = -25200*(9/14) = -25200/14*9 = -1800*9 = -16200.

Then, c² + h² = 12600 + 9900 = 22500.

Adding 8100 -16200 +22500: 8100 -16200 = -8100; -8100 +22500 = 14400. So, sqrt(14400) = 120. That seems correct.

Therefore, the minimal HP is 120 meters, so the saved rope is 280 - 120 = 160 meters.
</execution_5.1>

<execution_5.2>
From equations:

1. c² + d² = 19600

2. c² - d² = 5600

Adding equations 1 and 2: 2c² = 20200 → c² = 10100? Wait, wait, that contradicts previous result. Wait, no. Wait, equation 4 was c² - d² = 5600. Then equation 1 is c² + d² = 19600. So, adding:

Equation 1 + Equation 4:

(c² + d²) + (c² - d²) = 19600 + 5600 → 2c² = 25200 → c² = 12600. Then, from equation 1: 12600 + d² = 19600 → d² = 19600 - 12600 = 7000. So, that's correct.

Then, c² = 12600, d² = 7000. Then, h² from equation 3: d² + h² = 16900 → 7000 + h² = 16900 → h² = 9900. Correct.

So, h = sqrt(9900) ≈ 99.4987. Correct.

Then, when computing f(t):

At t = c² / 19600 = 12600 / 19600 = 9/14 ≈ 0.6429. Then, plugging back into f(t):

19600*(9/14)^2 = 19600*(81/196) = 8100.

Then, -2c²*t = -2*12600*(9/14) = -25200*(9/14) = -16200.

Then, c² + h² = 12600 + 9900 = 22500.

So, 8100 - 16200 + 22500 = 14400. So, sqrt(14400) = 120. Correct. So, HP is 120. Therefore, the saved rope is 280 - 120 = 160 meters.
