</Question>

<think>
<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to find the greatest possible value of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of (n + 7) and (2n + 1), where n is a positive integer. Hmm, let's start by recalling what gcd means. The gcd of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. So, I need to figure out how big this gcd can get for some n.

First, maybe I can use the Euclidean algorithm. That's a common method for finding gcds. The Euclidean algorithm says that gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a mod b). So, if I let a = 2n + 1 and b = n + 7, then gcd(2n + 1, n + 7) is the same as gcd(n + 7, (2n + 1) mod (n + 7)).

Let me compute (2n + 1) divided by (n + 7).

But let me check with another approach to be thorough.

Alternatively, suppose d divides both n + 7 and 2n + 1. Then d divides their linear combinations. For example, d divides 2n + 1 - 2*(n + 7). Let's compute that:

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
Let's see, how many times does n + 7 go into 2n + 1? Well, if I multiply n + 7 by 2, I get 2n + 14. But 2n + 14 is 2n + 1 plus 13. So, 2n + 1 is actually 2*(n + 7) - 13. Let me check that: 2*(n + 7) is 2n + 14, and subtracting 13 gives 2n + 1. So, (2n + 1) mod (n + 7) is the same as (2*(n + 7) - 13) mod (n + 7), which is equivalent to -13 mod (n + 7). But since we're dealing with positive remainders, that would be the same as (n + 7) - 13. Wait, no. The remainder when you divide by (n + 7) should be between 0 and (n + 6). So, if 2n + 1 is 2*(n + 7) - 13, then the remainder is actually | -13 | if n + 7 is larger than 13. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.

Alternatively, let's perform the division properly. Divide 2n + 1 by n + 7. The quotient is 2, because 2*(n + 7) = 2n + 14, which is 3 more than 2n + 1. Wait, no. If I have 2n + 1 divided by n + 7, how many times does n + 7 go into 2n + 1? Let's see:

Let me write it as:

2n + 1 = q*(n + 7) + r, where q is the quotient and r is the remainder, with 0 ≤ r < n + 7.

To find q, we can divide the coefficients. The leading term of the dividend is 2n and the divisor is n, so q would be 2. Then, multiply the divisor by 2: 2*(n + 7) = 2n + 14. Subtract that from the dividend:

(2n + 1) - (2n + 14) = 2n + 1 - 2n - 14 = -13.

So, the remainder r is -13. But remainders can't be negative, so we need to adjust. Since the remainder is negative, we can add the divisor (n + 7) to it to get the equivalent positive remainder. So, r = -13 + (n + 7) = n - 6. Therefore, the remainder is n - 6. Wait, but we need to ensure that this remainder is non-negative and less than the divisor (n + 7). So, n - 6 ≥ 0 implies n ≥ 6, and since n is a positive integer, n must be at least 6. For n < 6, the remainder would actually be 0? Wait, no. Let me check with n = 5.

If n = 5, then 2n + 1 = 11, and n + 7 = 12. Then, 11 divided by 12 is 0 with a remainder of 11. So, in that case, the remainder is 11, which is equal to 2n + 1 when n =5. So, my previous reasoning might be flawed here.

<execution_1.2>
2n + 1 - 2*(n + 7) = 2n + 1 - 2n - 14 = -13. 

So, d divides -13, which means d divides 13. Since 13 is a prime number, the possible divisors are 1 and 13. Therefore, the greatest possible value of gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) is 13.

Based on execution_1.1:
Hmm, maybe I need to correct that. Let's formalize the Euclidean algorithm step:

But let me confirm by plugging in n = 5, as before.

Let's check another example. Suppose n = 14 (which is 13 + 1).

What if we take n = 6 (the minimum n for which remainder is 0):

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
gcd(2n + 1, n + 7) = gcd(n + 7, (2n + 1) mod (n + 7)).

As we saw earlier, (2n + 1) mod (n + 7) is equal to (2n + 1) - 2*(n + 7) = 2n + 1 - 2n - 14 = -13. But since the remainder must be positive, we take the absolute value, so the remainder is 13. Wait, but that can't be right because when n + 7 is less than 13, the remainder would actually be 2n + 1 - 2*(n + 7) = -13, but since we can't have negative remainders, we adjust by adding (n + 7) to the remainder. Wait, maybe the remainder is actually (2n + 1) - 2*(n + 7) + k*(n + 7) such that it's positive. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the remainder is (2n + 1) - 2*(n + 7) = -13, but since remainders are non-negative, we can write this as (n + 7) - 13. Wait, no. Let me use the division algorithm properly. For any integers a and b (with b > 0), there exist unique integers q and r such that a = bq + r and 0 ≤ r < b. So here, a = 2n + 1 and b = n + 7. Then, we need to find q and r such that 2n + 1 = q*(n + 7) + r, 0 ≤ r < n + 7.

Let me solve for q. If we divide 2n + 1 by n + 7, the quotient q should be 1 because n + 7 is approximately the same as 2n + 1 when n is small, but actually, wait, if n is large, 2n + 1 is twice n + 7 minus 13. Wait, maybe I need to do this step by step.

Let me rearrange the equation:

2n + 1 = q*(n + 7) + r.

Let me solve for q and r. Let's assume q = 1:

Then, 2n + 1 = 1*(n + 7) + r => r = 2n + 1 - n - 7 = n - 6.

So, if q = 1, then r = n - 6. But for this to be a valid remainder, we need 0 ≤ r < n + 7. So, 0 ≤ n - 6 < n + 7. The left inequality gives n - 6 ≥ 0 => n ≥ 6. The right inequality is n - 6 < n + 7, which is always true since -6 < 7. So, when n ≥ 6, the remainder is n - 6, and the gcd becomes gcd(n + 7, n - 6).

If n < 6, then r = n - 6 would be negative, which isn't allowed. So in those cases, we need to adjust. Let's try q = 2:

If q = 2, then r = 2n + 1 - 2*(n + 7) = 2n + 1 - 2n - 14 = -13. But remainder can't be negative, so we need to adjust. Since the remainder is negative, we can take q = 1 and adjust r by adding (n + 7) to the negative remainder. Wait, but if q = 2 gives a negative remainder, that suggests that the actual quotient should be q = 1 and the remainder is (2n + 1) - 1*(n + 7) = n - 6. But when n < 6, n - 6 is negative, so that can't be. Therefore, perhaps for n < 6, the remainder is (2n + 1) when divided by (n + 7). Let me check with n = 5:

If n = 5, then n + 7 = 12, and 2n + 1 = 11. So, 11 divided by 12 is 0 with a remainder of 11. So, in that case, the remainder is 11, which is 2n + 1. So, perhaps when 2n + 1 < n + 7, the remainder is 2n + 1, otherwise, it's n - 6. Let's check when 2n + 1 < n + 7:

2n + 1 < n + 7 => n < 6. So, for n < 6, the remainder is 2n + 1, and for n ≥ 6, the remainder is n - 6. Therefore, the Euclidean algorithm steps would be:

If n ≥ 6: gcd(2n + 1, n + 7) = gcd(n + 7, n - 6).

If n < 6: gcd(2n + 1, n + 7) = gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1).

So, let's consider both cases.

First, for n ≥ 6: gcd(n + 7, n - 6) = gcd(n - 6, (n + 7) - (n - 6)) = gcd(n - 6, 13). Because (n + 7) - (n - 6) = 13. Therefore, the gcd of n - 6 and 13. Since 13 is prime, the gcd can be either 1 or 13. Therefore, the maximum possible gcd in this case is 13, which occurs when 13 divides (n - 6). So, n - 6 must be a multiple of 13, i.e., n = 13k + 6 for some integer k ≥ 0. Since n must be a positive integer, k can be 0, 1, 2, ...

For k = 0: n = 6. Let's check that case.

If n = 6, then n + 7 = 13 and 2n + 1 = 13. So, gcd(13, 13) = 13.

For k = 1: n = 19. Then, n + 7 = 26 and 2n + 1 = 39. gcd(26, 39) = 13.

For k = 2: n = 32. Then, n + 7 = 39 and 2n + 1 = 65. gcd(39, 65) = 13. 

So, indeed, whenever n = 13k + 6, the gcd is 13.

Now, for the case when n < 6: gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1). Let's compute this for n = 1 to 5:

For n = 1: gcd(8, 3) = 1.

For n = 2: gcd(9, 5) = 1.

For n = 3: gcd(10, 7) = 1.

For n = 4: gcd(11, 9) = 1.

For n = 5: gcd(12, 11) = 1.

So, in all cases where n < 6, the gcd is 1. Therefore, the maximum possible gcd is 13, achieved when n = 6, 19, 32, etc.

<execution_2.2>
gcd(12, 11) is 1, which matches gcd(12, 11) = 1. But according to the Euclidean algorithm, gcd(12, 11) = gcd(11, 1) = 1. But in the step before, when n = 5, the remainder was 11, which is 2n + 1. So, in general, if n + 7 is less than 2n + 1, then the remainder is 2n + 1 - 2*(n + 7) = -13, but since remainder can't be negative, we take absolute value? Wait, no. The Euclidean algorithm takes the positive remainder. So, if we have a = bq + r, then r is positive. So, in this case, 2n + 1 divided by n + 7: Let's see, when n + 7 ≤ 2n + 1, which simplifies to n + 7 ≤ 2n + 1 => 7 - 1 ≤ 2n - n => 6 ≤ n. So, for n ≥ 6, n + 7 ≤ 2n + 1. Therefore, in that case, the quotient q is 1, and the remainder r is (2n + 1) - 1*(n + 7) = 2n + 1 - n - 7 = n - 6. So, for n ≥ 6, the remainder is n - 6. For n < 6, the quotient q is 0, and the remainder is 2n + 1, since n + 7 is larger than 2n + 1 when n < 6. Wait, let's check n =5: n + 7 =12, 2n +1=11. So, 12 >11, so quotient is 0, remainder is11. For n=6: n +7=13, 2n +1=13. So, 13 divided by13 is 1 with remainder 0. So, in that case, the remainder is 0. Therefore, putting this together:

If n ≥6, then gcd(2n +1, n +7) = gcd(n +7, n -6). Then, we apply the Euclidean algorithm again on n +7 and n -6. So, gcd(n +7, n -6) = gcd(n -6, (n +7) -1*(n -6)) = gcd(n -6, 13). Because (n +7) - (n -6) =13. Therefore, the gcd is gcd(n -6,13). Since 13 is prime, the gcd can be 1 or13. Therefore, the greatest possible value is13, which occurs when13 divides n -6, i.e., when n -6 is a multiple of13. So, n =13k +6 for some integer k ≥0. Since n must be positive, k can be 0,1,2,... So, the maximum gcd is13, achieved when n=6,20,34, etc. Wait, but let's check n=6. If n=6, then n +7=13, 2n +1=13. So, gcd(13,13)=13. That works. For n=19 (next one: 13*1 +6=19), let's check:

n=19: n +7=26, 2n +1=39. gcd(26,39). 26=2*13, 39=3*13, so gcd is13. Correct. So, indeed, when n=13k +6, the gcd is13.
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
Then n + 7 = 21, 2n + 1 = 29. gcd(21, 29) is 1. Wait, but 13 divides 2n +1 when n=5: 2*5 +1=11, which is not divisible by 13. Wait, but when we used the linear combination, we saw that gcd divides 13, so the gcd can be 13 only if 13 divides both n +7 and 2n +1. Let's check when n +7 is divisible by 13. Let n +7 =13k, so n=13k -7. Then 2n +1=2*(13k -7)+1=26k -14 +1=26k -13=13*(2k -1). So, 13 divides both n +7 and 2n +1 when n=13k -7. Therefore, the gcd would be 13. For example, take k=1: n=13*1 -7=6. Then n=6: n +7=13, 2n +1=13. gcd(13,13)=13. That works. For k=2: n=13*2 -7=26-7=19. Then n +7=26, 2n +1=39. gcd(26,39)=13. Correct again.

<execution_2.4>
Then, gcd(6 + 7, 2*6 + 1) = gcd(13, 13) = 13. That works. If n = 13, gcd(20, 27) = gcd(20, 7) = 1. Wait, no. Wait, n = 13: n + 7 = 20, 2n + 1 = 27. gcd(20, 27). 20 factors are 2,2,5; 27 is 3,3,3. So, gcd is 1. Hmm, so if n = 13, the gcd is 1. But when n = 6, it's 13. So, the gcd can be 13 when n = 6, and 1 otherwise? Wait, but 13 is the maximum possible.
</execution_2.4>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Therefore, the maximum possible gcd is 13.
So, the answer should be 13. Let me check once more with n = 6: gcd(13,13) =13. For n=19: gcd(26,39)=13. For n=32: gcd(39,65)=13. All correct.

But just to ensure there's no mistake, let's re-examine the steps. The key insight was to apply the Euclidean algorithm and recognize that the gcd reduces to gcd(n - 6,13), which can be at most13.
Therefore, the greatest possible value is13. 

**Final Answer**
The greatest possible value is \boxed{13}.
