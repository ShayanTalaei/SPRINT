Find the constant term in the expansion of $$\left(10x^3-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^{5}$$
</Question>

<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to find the constant term in the expansion of (10x³ - 1/(2x²))⁵. Hmm, let's see. I remember that when you have a binomial expansion, each term is of the form C(n, k) * a^(n-k) * b^k, right? Where C(n, k) is the combination, n is the exponent, and k is the term number starting from 0. So in this case, the binomial is (10x³ - 1/(2x²)) raised to the 5th power. So n is 5 here.

I need to find the term where the exponent of x is zero because that's the constant term. So each term in the expansion will look like C(5, k) * (10x³)^(5 - k) * (-1/(2x²))^k. Let me write that out step by step.

First, the combination part: that's C(5, k). Then, (10x³) raised to (5 - k). So that would be 10^(5 - k) * x^(3*(5 - k)). Then the other part is (-1/(2x²))^k. Let's break that down: (-1)^k * (1/(2x²))^k. That becomes (-1)^k * (1/2)^k * x^(-2k). So combining all those parts, the term is C(5, k) * 10^(5 - k) * (-1)^k * (1/2)^k * x^(15 - 3k - 2k). Wait, the exponent on x is 15 - 5k. Because 3*(5 - k) is 15 - 3k, and then we subtract 2k from that, so 15 - 5k.

Based on execution_1.1:
We need the exponent of x to be zero for the constant term. So set 15 - 5k = 0.
Solving for k: 15 = 5k => k = 3. So the constant term is the term when k = 3.

Now, let's compute that term. C(5, 3) * 10^(5 - 3) * (-1)^3 * (1/2)^3.

But let me think again if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using the general term formula for binomial expansion. The general term T_{k+1} = C(n, k) * a^{n - k} * b^k. Here, a = 10x³, b = -1/(2x²), n =5.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the multinomial theorem, but since it's a binomial, the standard binomial expansion should suffice. Let me confirm once more.

First, compute the combination: C(5, 3) is 10. Then, 10^(5 - 3) is 10² = 100. Then, (-1)^3 is -1. (1/2)^3 is 1/8. So multiplying all these together: 10 * 100 * (-1) * (1/8). Let's compute that step by step. 10 * 100 is 1000. Then 1000 * (-1) is -1000. Then -1000 * (1/8) is -125. So the constant term is -125.

We set the exponent of x to zero. The exponent of x in T_{k+1} is 3*(5 - k) + (-2)*k = 15 - 3k - 2k = 15 -5k. Setting 15 -5k =0 gives k=3 as before. So substituting k=3 into the term gives the same result: 10 terms.

<execution_2.3>
The exponent on x is 15 -5k. Setting to zero gives k=3. Then the coefficient is 10^(2) * (-1)^3 / 2^3 * C(5,3). 10^2 is 100, (-1)^3 is -1, 2^3 is 8. C(5,3) is 10. So 100 * (-1) * 10 /8 = -1000/8 = -125. Yep, that seems consistent.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. Let me check the combination: C(5,3) is 10. 5 choose 3 is 10. Then 10 * 100 is 1000. Then multiply by -1 gives -1000. Divided by 8 is -125. Correct.

So the constant term is -125. I think that's the answer.

Therefore, the constant term in the expansion is $\boxed{-125}$.
