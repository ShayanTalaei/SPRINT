Okay, so I need to find the values of λ between 0 and 4 where there's some x in [0,1] such that f(x) isn't equal to x, but applying f twice does give x. The function f is given by f(x) = λx(1 - x). Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

<prompt_1.1> Understand the problem statement and set up the necessary equations for finding periodic points of period 2. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
First, I remember that fixed points are where f(x) = x. But here, we need points where applying f twice brings us back to x, but f(x) itself isn't x. These are called periodic points of period 2. So essentially, we're looking for 2-periodic points that aren't fixed points.

To approach this, I should first find the fixed points of f, then see when there are points that are periodic with period 2. The key equation here is f(f(x)) = x. Let me write that out. Let's compute f(f(x)) first.

Given f(x) = λx(1 - x), so f(f(x)) would be λ times f(x) times (1 - f(x)). Let me compute that:

f(f(x)) = λ * f(x) * (1 - f(x)) = λ * [λx(1 - x)] * [1 - λx(1 - x)]

So, f(f(x)) = λ²x(1 - x)[1 - λx(1 - x)]. Then, setting this equal to x gives the equation:

λ²x(1 - x)[1 - λx(1 - x)] = x

We need to solve this equation for x in [0,1], and find λ in [0,4] such that there exists an x where this holds but f(x) ≠ x.

Based on execution_1.1:
So, let's rearrange the equation:

<prompt_2.1> Rearrange the equation f(f(x)) = x to form a polynomial equation in terms of x. </prompt_2.1>

Therefore, the answer is all λ in [0,4] except λ=0 and λ=4. Wait, but let me confirm with an example.

<prompt_2.2> Verify the solution with specific examples for λ=2 and λ=3. </prompt_2.2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
λ²x(1 - x)[1 - λx(1 - x)] - x = 0

Factor out x:

x [λ²(1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)) - 1] = 0

So, either x = 0 or the term in brackets is zero. But x=0 is a fixed point since f(0) = 0. Similarly, x=1 is also a fixed point. So, the solutions we are interested in are the solutions to:

λ²(1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)) - 1 = 0

Let me expand this equation step by step.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Take λ=2, which is in the interval. Then f(x) = 2x(1 - x), which is the logistic map at parameter 2. This is known to have a period-2 cycle. For example, solving f(f(x)) = x:

f(f(x)) = 2*(2x(1 - x))*(1 - 2x(1 - x)) = 4x(1 - x)(1 - 2x + 2x²)

Set equal to x:

4x(1 - x)(1 - 2x + 2x²) = x

Divide both sides by x (assuming x ≠0):

4(1 - x)(1 - 2x + 2x²) = 1

Expand the left side:

4[(1)(1 - 2x + 2x²) - x(1 - 2x + 2x²)] = 4[1 - 2x + 2x² - x + 2x² - 2x³] = 4[1 - 3x + 4x² - 2x³]

Set equal to 1:

4(1 - 3x + 4x² - 2x³) = 1 → 4 - 12x + 16x² - 8x³ = 1 → -8x³ +16x² -12x +3 =0

Multiply both sides by -1: 8x³ -16x² +12x -3=0. Let's solve this cubic. Maybe x=1/2 is a root? Plugging in: 8*(1/8) -16*(1/4) +12*(1/2) -3 =1 -4 +6 -3=0. Yes, x=1/2 is a root. Then factor out (x -1/2). Using polynomial division or synthetic division:

Divide 8x³ -16x² +12x -3 by (x -1/2). Coefficients: 8 | -16 |12 | -3

Using synthetic division with root 1/2:

Bring down 8. Multiply by 1/2: 4. Add to next coefficient: -16 +4 = -12. Multiply by 1/2: -6. Add to next coefficient:12 +(-6)=6. Multiply by1/2:3. Add to last coefficient: -3 +3=0. So the cubic factors as (x -1/2)(8x² -12x +6)=0. The quadratic equation 8x² -12x +6=0 has discriminant 144 - 192 = -48 <0, so only real root is x=1/2. But f(1/2)=2*(1/2)*(1 -1/2)=2*(1/2)*(1/2)=2*(1/4)=1/2. So x=1/2 is a fixed point. So in this case, for λ=2, all solutions to f(f(x))=x are fixed points? But wait, that contradicts my previous thought.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, when λ=2, the function is f(x)=2x(1 -x). Let's compute f(1/3):

f(1/3)=2*(1/3)*(2/3)=4/9. Then f(4/9)=2*(4/9)*(5/9)=40/81 ≈0.4938. Then f(40/81)=2*(40/81)*(41/81)=2*1640/6561≈5280/6561≈0.806. Then f(0.806)=2*0.806*0.194≈2*0.156≈0.313. Then f(0.313)=2*0.313*0.687≈2*0.213≈0.426. Hmm, seems like it's not returning to 1/3. Maybe my example was wrong. Wait, but according to the equation, the only real solution was x=1/2, which is a fixed point. So maybe for λ=2, there are no 2-periodic points? But I thought logistic map at λ=2 has period-2 points.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated. Let me check again.

Therefore, the answer is all λ in [0,4] except λ=0 and λ=4. Wait, but let me confirm with another example.

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
First, expand the term inside the brackets:

Let me denote the term inside the brackets as:

<prompt_3.1> Expand and simplify the equation obtained after expanding the term inside the brackets. </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
Term = λ²(1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)) - 1/(x) ? Wait, no. Wait, we already factored out x, so the equation is:

λ²(1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)) - 1 = 0

Wait, no. Let me correct that. The equation after factoring out x is:

x [ λ²(1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)) - 1 ] = 0

So, either x = 0 or the expression in the brackets is zero. But x=0 is a fixed point, as f(0) = 0. Similarly, x=1 is a fixed point. So, we need to solve:

λ²(1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)) - 1 = 0

Let me expand the term inside. Let's first compute 1 - λx(1 - x):

1 - λx + λx²

So, the term becomes:

λ²(1 - x)(1 - λx + λx²) - 1 = 0

Now, let's expand (1 - x)(1 - λx + λx²):

Multiply term by term:

1*(1 - λx + λx²) - x*(1 - λx + λx²) = (1 - λx + λx²) - (x - λx² + λx³)

Combine like terms:

1 - λx + λx² - x + λx² - λx³

Combine the x terms: (-λx - x) = -x(λ + 1)

Combine the x² terms: (λx² + λx²) = 2λx²

Then the x³ term: -λx³

So altogether:

1 - (λ + 1)x + 2λx² - λx³

Therefore, the equation becomes:

λ²[1 - (λ + 1)x + 2λx² - λx³] - 1 = 0

Multiply through by λ²:

λ² * 1 - λ²(λ + 1)x + λ²*2λx² - λ²*λx³ - 1 = 0

Simplify each term:

λ² - λ²(λ + 1)x + 2λ³x² - λ³x³ - 1 = 0

Now, let's write the entire equation:

-λ³x³ + 2λ³x² - λ²(λ + 1)x + (λ² - 1) = 0

Let me rearrange the terms in descending powers of x:

-λ³x³ + 2λ³x² - λ²(λ + 1)x + (λ² - 1) = 0

Multiply both sides by -1 to make the leading coefficient positive:

λ³x³ - 2λ³x² + λ²(λ + 1)x - (λ² - 1) = 0

So, the equation is:

λ³x³ - 2λ³x² + λ²(λ + 1)x - (λ² - 1) = 0

</Execution_3>

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
Now, we need to solve this cubic equation in x. But remember, x must be in [0,1], and we already know that x=0 and x=1 are solutions to the original equation f(f(x))=x, but they are fixed points. However, when we factored out x, we got x times the cubic equation. So actually, the solutions are x=0, x=1, and the roots of the cubic equation:

<prompt_4.1> Analyze the cubic equation and determine the conditions under which it has roots in [0,1]. </prompt_4.1>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
λ³x³ - 2λ³x² + λ²(λ + 1)x - (λ² - 1) = 0

But in our problem, we need solutions x where f(x) ≠ x, but f(f(x)) = x. Therefore, we need roots of the cubic equation that are not x=0 or x=1. So, effectively, we need the cubic equation to have roots in [0,1] other than x=0 and x=1. However, solving a cubic equation might be complicated, but maybe we can factor it or find some roots.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use substitution or another method. Let me think.

Alternatively, instead of expanding everything, maybe we can find a substitution. Let me note that fixed points satisfy f(x) = x, so λx(1 - x) = x. So, x(λ(1 - x) - 1) = 0, so x=0 or λ(1 - x) -1 =0 → λ(1 - x)=1 → 1 - x=1/λ → x=1 - 1/λ. But since x must be in [0,1], 1 - 1/λ must be in [0,1], so 1/λ ≤1 → λ ≥1. So, for λ ≥1, there is a fixed point at x=1 - 1/λ. For λ <1, the only fixed point is x=0.

But in our problem, we are to find λ where there exists an x ≠ fixed point (i.e., x ≠0 and x≠1) such that f(f(x))=x. So, perhaps the roots of the cubic equation correspond to these periodic points.

Alternatively, another approach is to note that if f(f(x)) = x, then f has a periodic point of period 2. The existence of such points can be analyzed by considering the graph of f and f(f(x)).

Alternatively, perhaps consider solving f(f(x)) = x for x. Let me set y = f(x). Then f(y) = x. So, we have the system:

y = λx(1 - x)

x = λy(1 - y)

So substituting the first equation into the second:

x = λ[λx(1 - x)][1 - λx(1 - x)]

Which is exactly the equation f(f(x)) = x. So, this gives us the same equation as before.

But perhaps we can consider this as a system of equations:

y = λx(1 - x)

x = λy(1 - y)

So, substituting the first into the second, we get x = λy(1 - y) = λ[λx(1 - x)][1 - λx(1 - x)], which is the same as before. Therefore, the solutions to this system are the fixed points and the 2-periodic points. The fixed points satisfy x = y, so solving y = λx(1 - x) and x = y gives x = λx(1 - x), which is the fixed point equation.

Therefore, to find the 2-periodic points, we need solutions where x ≠ y. So, subtracting the two equations, we can find such solutions.

Alternatively, perhaps subtract the two equations:

From y = λx(1 - x) and x = λy(1 - y), subtract the second from the first:

y - x = λx(1 - x) - λy(1 - y)

But this might not be helpful. Alternatively, let's consider dividing the two equations. Let's take the ratio:

y / x = [λx(1 - x)] / x = λ(1 - x)

Similarly, x / y = [λy(1 - y)] / y = λ(1 - y)

Therefore, (y / x) * (x / y) = λ(1 - x) * λ(1 - y) = 1

So, λ²(1 - x)(1 - y) = 1

But since y = λx(1 - x), substitute that in:

λ²(1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)) = 1

Wait, this is exactly the equation we had earlier! So, this approach leads us back to the same equation. Therefore, the equation λ²(1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)) = 1 must hold for the 2-periodic points.

So, perhaps we can write this equation as:

λ²(1 - x)(1 - λx + λx²) = 1

Which is the same as before.

Based on execution_4.1:
Alternatively, perhaps we can parametrize x in terms of another variable. Let me set t = x. Then, perhaps not. Alternatively, let's consider that the equation λ²(1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)) = 1 must have a solution x in [0,1], x ≠0,1. So, perhaps we can analyze this equation for λ in [0,4].

Alternatively, let's consider solving for x. Let me rearrange the equation:

λ²(1 - x)(1 - λx + λx²) = 1

Expanding the left-hand side:

λ²(1 - x)(1 - λx + λx²) = λ²[(1)(1 - λx + λx²) - x(1 - λx + λx²)]

= λ²[1 - λx + λx² - x + λx² - λx³]

= λ²[1 - (λ + 1)x + 2λx² - λx³]

Therefore, setting this equal to 1:

λ²[1 - (λ + 1)x + 2λx² - λx³] = 1

Which gives:

λ² - λ²(λ + 1)x + 2λ³x² - λ³x³ = 1

Bring all terms to one side:

-λ³x³ + 2λ³x² - λ²(λ + 1)x + (λ² - 1) = 0

Multiply by -1:

λ³x³ - 2λ³x² + λ²(λ + 1)x - (λ² - 1) = 0

So, we have a cubic equation in x:

λ³x³ - 2λ³x² + λ²(λ + 1)x - (λ² - 1) = 0

Take λ=4. Then f(x)=4x(1 -x). Let's compute f(f(x)):

f(f(x)) =4*(4x(1 -x))*(1 -4x(1 -x))=16x(1 -x)*(1 -4x +4x²)

Set equal to x:

16x(1 -x)*(1 -4x +4x²)=x

Divide both sides by x (x≠0):

16(1 -x)*(1 -4x +4x²)=1

Expand left side:

16[(1)(1 -4x +4x²) -x(1 -4x +4x²)] =16[1 -4x +4x² -x +4x² -4x³] =16[1 -5x +8x² -4x³]

Set equal to 1:

16(1 -5x +8x² -4x³)=1 →16 -80x +128x² -64x³=1 →-64x³ +128x² -80x +15=0

Multiply by -1:64x³ -128x² +80x -15=0

Let's check if x=1/2 is a root:64*(1/8) -128*(1/4) +80*(1/2) -15=8 -32 +40 -15=1≠0. Not a root. Let's try x=3/4:64*(27/64) -128*(9/16) +80*(3/4) -15=27 -72 +60 -15=0. Yes, x=3/4 is a root. Then factor out (x -3/4). Using synthetic division:

Coefficients:64 | -128 |80 |-15

Divide by x=3/4:

Bring down 64. Multiply by 3/4:48. Add to -128: -80. Multiply by 3/4: -60. Add to 80:20. Multiply by 3/4:15. Add to -15:0. So, factors as (x -3/4)(64x² -80x +20)=0. The quadratic equation 64x² -80x +20=0. Discriminant:6400 - 4096=2304=48². Solutions: [80 ±48]/128=(128)/128=1 or 32/128=1/4. So roots at x=1, x=1/4, x=3/4. But x=1 is a fixed point. Check x=1/4: f(1/4)=4*(1/4)*(3/4)=3/4. Then f(3/4)=4*(3/4)*(1 -3/4)=4*(3/4)*(1/4)=3/4. Wait, f(3/4)=4*(3/4)*(1/4)=3/4. So f(1/4)=3/4 and f(3/4)=3/4. Wait, that can't be. Wait, no: f(3/4)=4*(3/4)*(1 -3/4)=4*(3/4)*(1/4)=4*(3/16)=3/4. So f(3/4)=3/4. Therefore, x=3/4 is a fixed point. Wait, but according to the equation, x=3/4 is a root, but it's actually a fixed point. So the only roots are x=1, x=3/4 (fixed point), and x=1/4. Wait, but x=1/4: f(1/4)=3/4, which is a fixed point. So f(f(1/4))=f(3/4)=3/4≠1/4. Therefore, x=1/4 is a point where f(f(x))=x, but f(x)≠x. So, x=1/4 is a 2-periodic point. Therefore, even at λ=4, there exists such points. Therefore, λ=4 should be excluded? Wait, but according to our previous analysis, when λ=4, the equation f(f(x))=x has roots at x=1/4 and x=3/4 (fixed points). Wait, but x=3/4 is a fixed point, so the only non-fixed point solution is x=1/4. Therefore, even at λ=4, there exists x=1/4 such that f(f(1/4))=1/4≠f(1/4)=3/4. Wait, no: f(f(1/4))=f(3/4)=3/4≠1/4. Wait, that's not correct. Wait, hold on. Let me compute f(1/4) when λ=4:

f(1/4)=4*(1/4)*(1 -1/4)=4*(1/4)*(3/4)=3/4. Then f(3/4)=4*(3/4)*(1 -3/4)=4*(3/4)*(1/4)=3/4. Therefore, f(f(1/4))=f(3/4)=3/4≠1/4. Therefore, x=1/4 is not a solution to f(f(x))=x. Wait, but according to the equation, when λ=4, the equation had roots at x=1/4, 3/4, and 1. Wait, but x=3/4 is a fixed point, and x=1 is a fixed point. So, x=1/4 is not a solution? That contradicts the earlier calculation. Wait, perhaps an error in calculation.

Wait, when λ=4, the equation after factoring out x was:

4²(1 - x)(1 -4x(1 -x)) -1 =0 →16(1 -x)(1 -4x +4x²) -1=0. Then expanding:

16(1 -x)(1 -4x +4x²)=1. Then expanding the left side:

16[(1)(1 -4x +4x²) -x(1 -4x +4x²)] =16[1 -4x +4x² -x +4x² -4x³] =16[1 -5x +8x² -4x³]. Then setting equal to 1:

16(1 -5x +8x² -4x³)=1 →16 -80x +128x² -64x³=1 →-64x³ +128x² -80x +15=0. Then multiplying by -1:64x³ -128x² +80x -15=0. Then found roots at x=3/4, and quadratic gives x=1 and x=1/4. But x=1 and x=3/4 are fixed points. Wait, but if x=1/4, then f(1/4)=3/4, and f(3/4)=3/4. Therefore, f(f(1/4))=f(3/4)=3/4≠1/4. Therefore, x=1/4 is not a solution to f(f(x))=x. Therefore, the only roots are the fixed points. Therefore, even at λ=4, there are no points x where f(f(x))=x but f(x)≠x. Therefore, λ=4 should be excluded.

Similarly, at λ=0, the function f(x)=0, so f(f(x))=0, so the only fixed point is 0. Therefore, no 2-periodic points. Therefore, the answer is all λ in (0,4), excluding 0 and 4? Wait, but the problem states 0 ≤ λ ≤4. So, excluding λ=0 and λ=4. But let me confirm with another example. Take λ=1.

<prompt_5.1:
- At λ=0: f(x)=0, so f(f(x))=0. So, only fixed point.
- At λ=4: f(x)=4x(1 -x). As above, x=1/4 is not a solution.
