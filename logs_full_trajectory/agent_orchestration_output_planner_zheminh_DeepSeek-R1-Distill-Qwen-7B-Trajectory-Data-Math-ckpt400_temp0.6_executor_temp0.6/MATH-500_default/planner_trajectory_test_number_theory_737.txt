Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking for the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let's break it down.

First, I need to find the proper divisors of 284. Proper divisors are numbers that divide 284 without leaving a remainder, but they have to be less than 284 itself. So, I should list all numbers less than 284 that divide 284 evenly.

<prompt_1.1> Plan how to find the proper divisors of 284 as per the above plan. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
Let me start by recalling that a divisor of a number is another number that can multiply another integer to result in the original number. For example, 2 is a divisor of 284 because 284 divided by 2 is 142, which is an integer. So, 2 is a proper divisor. Similarly, 4 would be a divisor because 284 divided by 4 is 71.

Based on execution_1.1:
Wait, maybe I should start by finding all the divisors of 284. Let's do that systematically.

<prompt_2.1> Execute the plan to find all divisors of 284 as per the above plan. </prompt_2.1>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
First, 1 and 284 are always divisors. Then 2, because 284 is even. 284 divided by 2 is 142. So, 2 and 142 are divisors. Next, let's check 4. 284 divided by 4 is 71, so 4 and 71 are divisors. Is 71 a prime number? Let me check. 71 divided by 2 is 35.5, not an integer. Divided by 3 is around 23.666, not integer. Divided by 5 is 14.2, nope. 7? 71 divided by 7 is about 10.14, nope. 11? 71 divided by 11 is around 6.45, still no. So, 71 is a prime number. Therefore, the divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71, 142, and 284. But since we need proper divisors, we exclude 284. So, the proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71, and 142.

Based on execution_2.1:
Now, let's sum those proper divisors.
Adding them up: 1 + 2 = 3, 3 + 4 = 7, 7 + 71 = 78, 78 + 142 = 220. So, the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 220.

Next, the problem asks for the sum of the proper divisors of this sum, which is 220. So now, I need to find the proper divisors of 220 and then add them together.

<prompt_3.1> Plan how to find the proper divisors of 220 as per the above plan. </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
Let's do the same process for 220. Let's list its proper divisors.

Starting with 1 and 220. Since 220 is even, 2 is a divisor. 220 divided by 2 is 110, so 2 and 110. Then 4, because 220 divided by 4 is 55. So, 4 and 55. Let's check 5: 220 divided by 5 is 44, so 5 and 44. Next, 10: 220 divided by 10 is 22, so 10 and 22. Let's see if there are more divisors. Let's check 11: 220 divided by 11 is 20, so 11 and 20. What about 20? We already have that. 22? Also already there. 44, 55, 110, 220. So, compiling all the proper divisors of 220: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, 110.

Based on execution_3.1:
Let me check if I missed any.

<prompt_4.1> Verify the list of proper divisors of 220 as per the above plan. </prompt_4.1>

Now, let's sum these proper divisors. Let's add them step by step:

<prompt_4.2> Sum the proper divisors of 220 as per the above plan. </prompt_4.2>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
Starting from 1 up to sqrt(220), which is approximately 14.83. So, checking up to 14. We've checked 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11. 14: 220 divided by 14 is 15.714, which is not an integer, so 14 is not a divisor. So, we have all the divisors up to 14. The corresponding pairs are as above. So, the proper divisors are indeed those 11 numbers.

1 + 2 = 3

3 + 4 = 7

7 + 5 = 12

12 + 10 = 22

22 + 11 = 33

33 + 20 = 53

53 + 22 = 75

75 + 44 = 119

119 + 55 = 174

174 + 110 = 284
</execution_4.2>
</Execution_4>

<Plan_5>
Based on execution_4.2:
Wait, that's interesting. The sum of the proper divisors of 220 is 284. So, does that mean that 284 and 220 are part of an amicable pair?
Where each is the sum of the proper divisors of the other? Let me confirm.

Yes, I remember that 220 and 284 are the smallest amicable pair. So, the sum of proper divisors of 220 is 284, and the sum of proper divisors of 284 is 220. So, that checks out.

Therefore, the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is the sum of the proper divisors of 220, which is 284.
Hence, the final answer should be 284.

Wait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors in adding the divisors of 220. Let me recount that sum:

Proper divisors of 220: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, 110.

Let's add them again:

<prompt_5.1> Recheck the sum of proper divisors of 220 as per the above plan. </prompt_5.1>

Therefore, the answer is indeed 284. But the problem says "the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284". So, step by step:

<prompt_5.2> Confirm the final result and present it as per the above plan. </prompt_5.2>

1 + 2 = 3

3 + 4 = 7

7 + 5 = 12

12 + 10 = 22

22 + 11 = 33

33 + 20 = 53

53 + 22 = 75

75 + 44 = 119

119 + 55 = 174

174 + 110 = 284
</execution_5.1>

1. Proper divisors of 284: 1, 2, 4, 71, 142. Sum is 1+2+4+71+142 = 220. Correct.

2. Proper divisors of 220: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, 110. Sum is 284. Correct.

Therefore, the answer is 284. But let me check if the problem specifies "sum of proper divisors" or "sum of all divisors". The problem says "proper divisors", so we exclude the number itself each time. So, yes, we did it right. Each time, when finding proper divisors, we exclude the number itself before summing.

Therefore, I believe the correct answer is 284. However, just to be thorough, let me verify once more each step.

First step: proper divisors of 284. Let's list them again:

1, 2, 4, 71, 142. Sum: 1+2=3, 3+4=7, 7+71=78, 78+142=220. Correct.

Second step: proper divisors of 220. Let's list them again:

1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, 110. Sum:

1+2=3, 3+4=7, 7+5=12, 12+10=22, 22+11=33, 33+20=53, 53+22=75, 75+44=119, 119+55=174, 174+110=284. Correct.

Therefore, the final result is 284. So, the answer is 284. But just to make sure, perhaps I can check with another method or cross-verify with known divisor sums.

Alternatively, maybe using the formula for the sum of divisors. The sum of all divisors (including the number) is denoted by σ(N). Then, the sum of proper divisors would be σ(N) - N. So, for 284, σ(284) - 284 = 220. Then, for 220, σ(220) - 220 = 284. So, that's another way to see it. Therefore, the answer is indeed 284.

<Final_answer>
284 is indeed the sum of the proper divisors of 220, which is the sum of the proper divisors of 284. Therefore, the final answer is $\boxed{284}$.
