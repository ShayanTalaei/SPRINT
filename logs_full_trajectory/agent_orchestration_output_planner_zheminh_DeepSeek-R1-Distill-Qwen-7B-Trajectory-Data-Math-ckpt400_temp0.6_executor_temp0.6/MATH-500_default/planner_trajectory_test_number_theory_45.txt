<Plan_1>
Okay, let's see. I need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 6432 and 132, and then increase that by 11. Hmm, how do I start?

First, I remember that the GCF of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. So, I need to figure out the factors of 6432 and 132 and find the largest one they have in common.

But maybe there's a better way than listing all the factors. I think the Euclidean algorithm is a efficient method for finding the GCF. Let me recall how that works. The Euclidean algorithm involves dividing the larger number by the smaller one, then replacing the larger number with the smaller one and the smaller number with the remainder from the division. You repeat this process until the remainder is zero, and the last non-zero remainder is the GCF.

Alright, let's apply that to 6432 and 132.

<prompt_1.1> Use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCF of 6432 and 132 as per the above plan. </prompt_1.1>

Wait, let me check if that's correct. Maybe I should verify using another method, just to be sure.

Alternatively, I can find the prime factors of both numbers and then multiply the common ones.

But just to be thorough, let me check another way. Let's list the factors of 132 and see which is the largest that divides 6432.

So, the two numbers are 6432 and 132. The larger one is 6432, so we divide 6432 by 132. Let me compute that.

First division: 6432 ÷ 132. Let me see, 132 times 48 is 6336 because 132*50 is 6600, subtract 132*2 which is 264, so 6600 - 264 = 6336. Then 6432 - 6336 is 96. So, the remainder is 96. So, the first step gives a remainder of 96.

Now, replace the numbers: the new pair is 132 and 96. Divide 132 by 96. 96*1 is 96, subtract from 132, remainder is 36. So, remainder 36.

Next pair is 96 and 36. Divide 96 by 36. 36*2 is 72, subtract from 96, remainder is 24. So, remainder 24.

Next pair is 36 and 24. Divide 36 by 24. 24*1 is 24, remainder is 12. Remainder 12.

Next pair is 24 and 12. Divide 24 by 12. 12*2 is 24, remainder is 0. Since the remainder is 0, the last non-zero remainder is 12. So, the GCF is 12.

Let's start with 132. Breaking it down:

132 ÷ 2 = 66  
66 ÷ 2 = 33  
33 ÷ 3 = 11  
11 ÷ 11 = 1  

So, the prime factors of 132 are 2² × 3 × 11.

Now, 6432. Let's factorize that:

6432 ÷ 2 = 3216  
3216 ÷ 2 = 1608  
1608 ÷ 2 = 804  
804 ÷ 2 = 402  
402 ÷ 2 = 201  
201 ÷ 3 = 67  
67 is a prime number. 

So, the prime factors of 6432 are 2⁵ × 3 × 67.

Now, the GCF is the product of the lowest powers of the common prime factors. The common primes are 2 and 3. For 2, the lowest power is 2² (since 132 has 2² and 6432 has 2⁵), and for 3, it's 3¹. So, GCF = 2² × 3 = 4 × 3 = 12.

<execution_1.3>
The factors of 132 can be found by prime factorization first. 132 divided by 2 is 66, divided by 2 again is 33, then 3 is 11. So, prime factors are 2^2 * 3^1 * 11^1. Therefore, the factors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 11, 12, 22, 33, 44, 66, 132. Now, check which of these divide 6432.

Starting from the largest factor, 132. Does 132 divide 6432? Let's divide 6432 by 132. 132*48 is 6336. 6432 - 6336 is 96. So, remainder 96. So, 132 is not a factor. Next, 66. 66*97=6402. 6432 - 6402=30. Remainder 30. Not divisible. Next, 44. 44*146=6424. 6432-6424=8. Remainder 8. Not divisible. Next, 33. 33*194=6402. 6432-6402=30. Remainder 30. Not divisible. Then 22. 22*292=6424. 6432-6424=8. Remainder 8. Not divisible. 12. 12*536=6432. Exactly. So 12 divides 6432. Therefore, the GCF is 12.

Based on execution_1.1:
Then, increasing that by 11: 12 + 11 = 23.

Based on execution_1.2, execution_1.3:
So, definitely 12 is the GCF. Then 12 +11=23.

I think that's solid. All methods converge to the same answer.
