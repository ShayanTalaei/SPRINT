Okay, so I need to find the radius of a sphere where the volume and the surface area are numerically equal. That means, even though volume is in cubic units and surface area is in square units, their numerical values are the same. Hmm, interesting. Let me start by recalling the formulas for the volume and surface area of a sphere.

The volume \( V \) of a sphere is given by \( V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 \), where \( r \) is the radius. The surface area \( A \) is \( A = 4\pi r^2 \). The problem states that these two are numerically equal, so I can set them equal to each other: \( \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 = 4\pi r^2 \).

Wait, but since they are numerically equal, even though they have different units, the numbers without the units would be the same. So, I can equate the expressions without the \(\pi\) and the units. Let me write that equation again, but simplifying it.

First, let me divide both sides of the equation by \(4\pi\) to simplify.
That gives me \( \frac{1}{3}r^3 = r^2 \).

Now, multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction: \( r^3 = 3r^2 \).

Then, subtract \(3r^2\) from both sides to set the equation to zero: \( r^3 - 3r^2 = 0 \). Factor out an \( r^2 \): \( r^2(r - 3) = 0 \).

This gives me two solutions: \( r^2 = 0 \) or \( r - 3 = 0 \). Since \( r = 0 \) doesn't make sense for a sphere (a sphere with radius 0 has no volume or surface area), the valid solution is \( r = 3 \).

Let me check this. If \( r = 3 \), then the volume is \( \frac{4}{3}\pi (3)^3 = \frac{4}{3}\pi \times 27 = 36\pi \).
The surface area is \( 4\pi (3)^2 = 4\pi \times 9 = 36\pi \). So, numerically, both are 36Ï€, so their numerical values are indeed equal.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any wrong assumptions. The problem says the volume and surface area are numerically equal, so when they say "numerically equal," does that mean the numbers without the units are the same? For example, if the volume was 36 cubic units and the surface area was 36 square units, then 36 equals 36.
So yes, that's exactly what it means here. So, solving \( \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 = 4\pi r^2 \) gives r = 3, which works.

Is there another possible solution? Let's see. When we divided both sides by \(4\pi\), we assumed that \(4\pi \neq 0\), which is true. Then, we ended up with \( r^2 = 0 \) or \( r = 3 \).
Since \( r = 0 \) is invalid, 3 is the only solution. So, that should be the answer.
