Okay, so I need to figure out how many different outfits can be made with 5 shirts, 6 pairs of pants, and 8 hats. Each outfit consists of one shirt, one pair of pants, and one hat. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem.

First, the basic idea is that for each item of clothing, you have a certain number of choices. To make an outfit, you pick one shirt, one pair of pants, and one hat. The question is asking for the total number of possible combinations.

I remember from math class something about the multiplication principle. Let me recall. If there are multiple independent choices to be made, the total number of combinations is the product of the number of choices for each item. So, for example, if there are 3 ways to choose something and 4 ways to choose another, then there are 3*4=12 ways to choose both.

Applying that here, since each outfit requires one shirt, one pair of pants, and one hat, these are independent choices. So the total number of outfits should be the number of shirts multiplied by the number of pants multiplied by the number of hats.
Let me write that out: Total outfits = shirts * pants * hats.

So plugging in the numbers: 5 * 6 * 8.

Let me compute that step by step.

Wait, let me check if I did that right. 5 shirts, 6 pants. If I just did shirts and pants first, 5*6=30. Then each of those 30 can be paired with 8 different hats. So 30*8=240.
Yes, that's the same result. So that seems to confirm it.

Is there another way to think about it? Maybe using permutations or combinations? Wait, but here the order doesn't matter, right?
Each outfit is just a combination of one shirt, one pants, one hat. There's no repetition since each item is only used once per outfit. So permutations where order doesn't matter would be combinations, but since we are choosing one of each, it's just the product.

Wait, another thought: does the problem allow for mixing and matching? Like, is there any restriction that, for example, you can't wear a particular hat with a shirt? The problem doesn't state any such restrictions, so we can assume all combinations are allowed. Therefore, it's a straightforward multiplication.

Let me verify with smaller numbers. Suppose there are 2 shirts, 3 pants, and 4 hats. Then total outfits should be 2*3*4=24.
If I list them out, for each shirt, there are 3 pants and 4 hats, so 3*4=12 per shirt, times 2 shirts gives 24. That works. So scaling up, 5*6*8=240 should be correct.

I don't think I'm missing anything here. The key is that each choice is independent, and there are no constraints.
So multiplying the numbers together gives the correct total.

First, 5 multiplied by 6. 5 times 6 is 30. Then, 30 multiplied by 8. Let's see, 30 times 8. 3 times 8 is 24, so 30 times 8 is 240.

<Final_answer>
Therefore, the total number of outfits you can make is $\boxed{240}$.
