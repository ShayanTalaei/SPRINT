Okay, so I need to figure out how many ways 6 girls and 2 boys can sit in a row with the condition that the two boys must sit next to each other. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem. We have a total of 8 people: 6 girls and 2 boys. They need to be arranged in a row, but the two boys want to sit together. Normally, if there were no restrictions, the number of ways would just be 8 factorial, which is 8! But since the two boys must sit next to each other, we need to adjust for that.

First, maybe I can think of the two boys as a single unit. If we consider the two boys as one "block," then instead of having 8 individual people, we have 7 units to arrange: the 6 girls plus the 1 block of boys.
The number of ways to arrange these 7 units would be 7! But wait, within the block, the two boys can be arranged in different ways. Since there are two boys, they can switch places within the block. So for each arrangement of the 7 units, there are 2! ways to arrange the boys within their block.

So, multiplying those together, the total number of arrangements would be 7! * 2! .

Let me check if that makes sense.
If we treat the two boys as a single entity, we reduce the problem to 7 entities total. Each of those 7 can be arranged in 7! ways, and the two boys can be in two different orders within their entity. So yes, 7! * 2! seems right.

Let me compute that.

7! is 5040, and 2! is 2, so 5040 * 2 = 10080.

Wait, but let me make sure there's no other factor I'm missing.

<prompt_1.1> Verify the calculation by considering the total number of people and the reduction made by treating the two boys as a single unit. </prompt_1.1>

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. Let's imagine the two boys sitting next to each other. How many possible positions are there for the boys' block in the row?

<prompt_1.2> Use an alternative method to verify the number of arrangements by considering the positions of the boys' block. </prompt_1.2>

Another way to think about it: suppose we first place the boys. How many ways can we choose two adjacent seats for the boys?

<prompt_1.3> Consider another alternative method by first placing the boys and then arranging everyone. </prompt_1.3>

Alternatively, if I didn't use the block method, would I get the same answer? Let's see. Total arrangements without restriction: 8! = 40320. If we subtract the arrangements where the boys are not sitting together, we should get the answer. But that might be more complicated. Let's see if it's feasible.

<execution_1.1>
The total number of people is 8, but by treating the two boys as a single unit, we have 7 units. So 7! accounts for all the permutations of these units, and 2! for the permutations within the boys' unit. That seems correct.

<execution_1.2>
The row has 8 seats. If the boys need to sit together, their block can start in seat 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6, 6-7, or 7-8. That's 7 possible starting positions for the boys' block. For each of these positions, the two boys can be arranged in 2! ways, and the remaining 6 girls can be arranged in 6! ways. So total arrangements would be 7 * 2! * 6! .

Let's compute that. 6! is 720, 2! is 2, so 7 * 2 * 720 = 7 * 1440 = 10080.
</execution_1.2>

<execution_1.3>
In a row of 8 seats, the number of adjacent pairs is 7. Because seats 1&2, 2&3, 3&4, 4&5, 5&6, 6&7, 7&8. So 7 possible pairs. For each pair, the two boys can be arranged in 2! ways (switch places), and the 6 girls can be arranged in the remaining 6 seats in 6! ways. So total arrangements would be 7 * 2! * 6!

Calculating the total arrangements where boys are not sitting together. To do this, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. The total number of arrangements is 8! . The number of arrangements where the two boys are sitting together is what we want, but if we subtract the arrangements where they are not sitting together from the total, we get the desired number. Wait, but actually, if we can compute the number of arrangements where the boys are not sitting together, then 8! minus that would give the answer. But perhaps this is more complicated. Let me try.

First, total arrangements: 8! = 40320. Now, arrangements where the two boys are not sitting together. To compute this, we can consider the total arrangements minus the arrangements where they are sitting together. But that's circular because that's the definition. So perhaps another approach. To compute the number of arrangements where the two boys are not sitting together, we can use the gap method. 

First, arrange the 6 girls. The number of ways to arrange the girls is 6! . Now, there are 7 gaps created by the girls where the boys can be placed: one before the first girl, one between each pair of girls, and one after the last girl. So, 7 gaps. We need to place the two boys in two different gaps to ensure they are not adjacent. The number of ways to choose two gaps from seven is C(7,2) = 21. Then, the two boys can be arranged in those two gaps in 2! ways. So total number of arrangements where boys are not sitting together is 6! * 21 * 2! .

Calculating that: 6! is 720. 21 * 2! is 21 * 2 = 42. So 720 * 42 = 30240. Then, subtract this from the total arrangements: 40320 - 30240 = 10080. So that matches the previous result. Therefore, the answer is 10080.

Based on execution_1.1, execution_1.2, execution_1.3, execution_1.4:
So that's another verification. So both methods give the same answer, which is reassuring.

Therefore, the number of ways is 7! * 2!
Which is 5040 * 2 = 10080.

Another way to think about it: imagine the two boys as a single entity. Then we have 7 entities to arrange, which can be done in 7!

ways. Then, the two boys can be arranged in 2! ways within their entity. So total is 7! * 2! = 10080.

I don't think there are any other factors here. The key is that the two boys must be adjacent, so treating them as a single unit is the right approach. The alternative method of considering the positions for the boys' block also works. Both approaches lead to the same answer, so I'm confident that 10080 is correct.

<Final_answer>
Therefore, the number of ways the 2 boys can sit next to each other in a row with all 8 children is $\boxed{10080}$.
