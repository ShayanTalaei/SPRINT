<Question>
If Rosa's age is divided by 2, 3, 4, or 6, the remainder is 1. If her age is divided by 7, the remainder is 0. She is less than 75 years old. How many years old is Rosa?

<Plan_1>
Okay, let's try to figure out Rosa's age. The problem says that when her age is divided by 2, 3, 4, or 6, there's always a remainder of 1. But when she divides her age by 7, there's no remainder. Also, she's less than 75 years old. Hmm, so I need to find a number that meets all these conditions.

First, let's break down the problem. The key here is that when her age is divided by those numbers (2, 3, 4, 6), the remainder is 1 each time. That means her age is one more than a multiple of each of these numbers. So if I subtract 1 from her age, the result should be divisible by 2, 3, 4, and 6 without any remainder. Let me note that down.
Let Rosa's age be N. Then N ≡ 1 mod 2, N ≡ 1 mod 3, N ≡ 1 mod 4, N ≡ 1 mod 6, and N ≡ 0 mod 7, with N < 75.

So, N - 1 must be a common multiple of 2, 3, 4, and 6. To find the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers first. Let's compute LCM of 2, 3, 4, 6.

<prompt_1.1> Calculate the LCM of 2, 3, 4, and 6. </prompt_1.1>

But let me check if there's another way to approach this, just to confirm. For example, maybe using the Chinese Remainder Theorem? Though since the moduli here (2,3,4,6) are not all pairwise coprime, the standard CRT might not apply directly, but the idea is similar. We're looking for a number that is 1 mod all of them, which reduces to the LCM approach.

Alternatively, let's think about numbers that are 1 more than a multiple of 2, 3, 4, 6. So, let's list numbers that are 1 more than these divisors. For example, multiples of 4 plus 1: 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33, 37, 41, 45, 49, 53, 57, 61, 65, 69, 73,... But these numbers also need to be 1 more than multiples of 3. So check which of these are 1 mod 3.

<prompt_1.2> List numbers that are 1 more than multiples of 2, 3, 4, and 6, and check which are 1 mod 3. </prompt_1.2>

None

<prompt_1.3> Verify that the LCM calculation is correct. </prompt_1.3>

Alternatively, maybe there's a smaller number. Wait, LCM of 2,3,4,6 is 12, so 12k +1.

<prompt_1.4> Check smaller multiples of the LCM to see if any satisfy all conditions. </prompt_1.4>

None

<prompt_1.5> Verify the LCM calculation one last time. </prompt_1.5>

Prime factors:
- 2 is prime.
- 3 is prime.
- 4 is 2².
- 6 is 2 × 3.

The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all primes present. So that would be 2² (from 4), 3 (from 3 or 6). Therefore, LCM = 4 × 3 = 12.

5 divided by 3 is 1 with remainder 2, so no. 9 divided by 3 is 3 with remainder 0, so no. 13 divided by 3 is 4 with remainder 1, yes. 17 divided by 3 is 5 with remainder 2, no. 21 divided by 3 is 7 with remainder 0, no. 25 divided by 3 is 8 with remainder 1, yes. 29 divided by 3 is 9 with remainder 2, no. 33 divided by 3 is 11 with remainder 0, no. 37 divided by 3 is 12 with remainder 1, yes. 41 divided by 3 is 13 with remainder 2, no. 45 divided by 3 is 15 with remainder 0, no. 49 divided by 3 is 16 with remainder 1, yes. 53 divided by 3 is 17 with remainder 2, no. 57 divided by 3 is 19 with remainder 0, no. 61 divided by 3 is 20 with remainder 1, yes. 65 divided by 3 is 21 with remainder 2, no. 69 divided by 3 is 23 with remainder 0, no. 73 divided by 3 is 24 with remainder 1, yes. 

So from the multiples of 4 plus 1, the numbers that are also 1 more than multiples of 3 are 13, 25, 37, 49, 61, 73, etc.

Let's see:

5 divided by 3 is 1 with remainder 2. So 5 is 2 mod 3. Not good. Next, 9: 9 divided by 3 is 3 with remainder 0. So 9 is 0 mod 3. Not good. 13: 13 divided by 3 is 4 with remainder 1. So 13 is 1 mod 3. Okay, so 13 is in the list. Then 17: 17 divided by 3 is 5 with remainder 2. Not good. 21: 21 divided by 3 is 7 with remainder 0. Not good. 25: 25 divided by 3 is 8 with remainder 1. So 25 is 1 mod 3. 29: 29 divided by 3 is 9 with remainder 2. Not good. 33: 33 divided by 3 is 11 with remainder 0. Not good. 37: 37 divided by 3 is 12 with remainder 1. So 37 is 1 mod 3. 41: 41 divided by 3 is 13 with remainder 2. Not good. 45: 45 divided by 3 is 15 with remainder 0. Not good. 49: 49 divided by 3 is 16 with remainder 1. So 49 is 1 mod 3. 53: 53 divided by 3 is 17 with remainder 2. Not good. 57: 57 divided by 3 is 19 with remainder 0. Not good. 61: 61 divided by 3 is 20 with remainder 1. So 61 is 1 mod 3. 65: 65 divided by 3 is 21 with remainder 2. Not good. 69: 69 divided by 3 is 23 with remainder 0. Not good. 73: 73 divided by 3 is 24 with remainder 1. So 73 is 1 mod 3.

So 13, 25, 37, 49, 61, 73. Then check which is divisible by 7. 73 is the last one, which is 7*10.428... So no. So 73 is out. So 49 is the only one. 49 divided by 7 is 7. So 49 is the answer.

<execution_1.5>
Let me check the LCM again. LCM of 2 and 3 is 6. LCM of 6 and 4: factors of 6 are 2,3; factors of 4 are 2². So LCM is 2²*3=12. Then LCM of 12 and 6 is still 12. So yes, LCM is 12. Therefore, the numbers are 13,25,37,49,61,73.

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Then Rosa's age is N = LCM + 1. But wait, not necessarily LCM, but any multiple of LCM. So N - 1 must be a multiple of 12. Therefore, N = 12k + 1, where k is a non-negative integer.

Now, we also have the condition that N must be divisible by 7. So 12k + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7. Let's write that as 12k ≡ -1 mod 7.

<prompt_2.1> Solve the congruence equation 12k ≡ -1 mod 7 to find k. </prompt_2.1>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
But 12 mod 7 is 5, since 7*1=7, 12-7=5. So 5k ≡ -1 mod 7. Which is the same as 5k ≡ 6 mod 7 (since -1 mod 7 is 6). Now, we need to solve for k in this congruence equation. 

To solve 5k ≡ 6 mod 7, we can multiply both sides by the modular inverse of 5 mod 7. The inverse of 5 modulo 7 is a number x such that 5x ≡ 1 mod 7. Testing x=3: 5*3=15≡1 mod7 (since 15-14=1). So the inverse is 3. Therefore, multiplying both sides by 3: k ≡ 6*3 ≡ 18 ≡ 4 mod 7. So k ≡ 4 mod 7. Therefore, k can be written as 7m + 4, where m is a non-negative integer.

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Therefore, substituting back into N: N = 12*(7m + 4) + 1 = 84m + 48 + 1 = 84m + 49. Now, since N must be less than 75, let's find possible values of m.

<prompt_3.1> Find the possible values of m such that N = 84m + 49 is less than 75. </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
Let's try m=0: N=49. m=1: 84 + 49 = 133. But 133 is more than 75, so that's too big. So the only possible value is m=0, which gives N=49.

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
Let's check if 49 meets all the conditions.

<prompt_4.1> Verify that 49 meets all the conditions of the problem. </prompt_4.1>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
First, divided by 2: 49/2=24 with remainder 1. Good. Divided by 3: 49/3=16 with remainder 1. Good. Divided by 4: 49/4=12 with remainder 1. Also good. Divided by 6: 49/6=8 with remainder 1. Perfect. And 49 divided by 7 is exactly 7, so no remainder. All conditions are satisfied. Also, 49 is less than 75. So that seems to be the answer.

</Execution_4>

<Plan_5>
Based on execution_4.1:
Wait, but let me check if there are any other possible ages. The next possible m would be 1, giving 84 + 49 = 133, but that's over 75, so nope. So 49 is the only one. Hmm. But let me just make sure I didn't miss any steps.

Alternatively, maybe list all numbers less than 75 that are 1 mod 7 and see which one is divisible by 7 when you add 1. Wait, no. Wait, N is divisible by 7, so N=7m. Also, N=12k +1. So 7m=12k +1. So 12k=7m -1. So 12k +1 must be divisible by 7. So 12k ≡ -1 mod7, which as before. So same equation. So the solution is k=7t +4. So N=12*(7t +4)+1=84t +49. So t=0 gives 49, t=1 gives 133. So 49 is the only one under 75. So yes, 49 is the answer.

But wait, let me check if there's another way. Maybe list numbers divisible by 7 under 75 and see which one is 1 more than a multiple of 2,3,4,6.

<prompt_5.1> List numbers divisible by 7 under 75 and check which are 1 more than multiples of 2, 3, 4, and 6. </prompt_5.1>

<execution_5.1>
Let's list multiples of 7 under 75:7,14,21,28,35,42,49,56,63,70.

Now check each of these minus 1: 6,13,20,27,34,41,48,55,62,69. Are all of these numbers (6,13,20,27,34,41,48,55,62,69) divisible by 2,3,4,6?

Check 6: divisible by 2,3,6. Yes. So 6 is divisible by 2,3,4? Wait, 6 divided by 4 is 1.5, so no. So 6 is not divisible by 4. Therefore, N=7 is out.

Next, 13-1=12. Wait, no. Wait, the numbers are N=7,14,21,... So N-1=6,13,20,... So for N=14, N-1=13. Is 13 divisible by 2,3,4,6? 13 divided by 2 is 6.5, no. So 13 is not divisible by 2,3,4,6. So N=14 is out.

Next, N=21. N-1=20. Check if 20 is divisible by 2,3,4,6. 20 divided by 2=10, yes. Divided by 3: 20/3≈6.666, no. So 20 not divisible by 3. So N=21 is out.

Next, N=28. N-1=27. Check divisibility: 27 divided by 2=13.5, no. So out.

N=35. N-1=34. 34 divided by 2=17, yes. Divided by 3: 34/3≈11.333, no. So out.

N=42. N-1=41. 41 divided by 2=20.5, nope. Out.

N=49. N-1=48. Check 48: divisible by 2, yes. 48/2=24. Divided by 3: 48/3=16, yes. Divided by 4: 48/4=12, yes. Divided by 6: 48/6=8, yes. So 48 is divisible by all. So N=49 is good.

Next, N=56. N-1=55. 55 divided by 2=27.5, nope. Out.

N=63. N-1=62. 62/2=31, yes. 62/3≈20.666, no. Out.

N=70. N-1=69. 69 divided by 2=34.5, nope. Out.

So again, only N=49 works. So that confirms it. Therefore, Rosa is 49 years old.
