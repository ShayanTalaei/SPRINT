Okay, so I need to find the equation of the hyperbola given the two foci, F1 at (10, 2) and F2 at (-16, 2), and the condition that the absolute difference of the distances from any point P on the hyperbola to these foci is 24. Then, I have to express this equation in the standard form of a hyperbola and find the sum h + k + a + b. Let me start by recalling what I know about hyperbolas.

First, the standard form of a hyperbola is either \(\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1\) or \(\frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} - \frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} = 1\), depending on whether it's opening horizontally or vertically. In this case, since the foci are given as F1 = (10, 2) and F2 = (-16, 2), both have the same y-coordinate, which is 2. That means the foci are aligned horizontally, right?
So the hyperbola should open left and right, meaning the standard form will be the first one: \(\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1\).

Next, the center of the hyperbola is the midpoint between the two foci. To find the midpoint, I can average the x-coordinates and average the y-coordinates of the foci.

<prompt_1.1> Determine the center (h, k) of the hyperbola by finding the midpoint of the foci. </prompt_1.1>

Now, the distance between the two foci is 2c. Let me compute the distance between F1 and F2. Since they have the same y-coordinate, the distance is just the difference in x-coordinates.

<prompt_1.2> Calculate the distance between the foci and find c. </prompt_1.2>

The definition of a hyperbola is the set of points where the absolute difference of the distances to the foci is 2a. Wait, the problem states that |PF1 - PF2| = 24. So that means 2a = 24, so a = 12. Let me confirm that.
Yes, for hyperbolas, the definition is indeed |PF1 - PF2| = 2a. So if 2a = 24, then a = 12.

<execution_1.1>
So the midpoint between (10, 2) and (-16, 2) is ((10 + (-16))/2, (2 + 2)/2). Let's compute that:

For the x-coordinate: (10 - 16)/2 = (-6)/2 = -3.
For the y-coordinate: (2 + 2)/2 = 4/2 = 2.
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
F1 is at x = 10, F2 is at x = -16, so the distance is |10 - (-16)| = |10 + 16| = 26. Therefore, 2c = 26, so c = 13. Got that: c = 13.

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1, execution_1.2:
Now, in hyperbolas, the relationship between a, b, and c is given by c² = a² + b². We know c and a, so we can solve for b. Let's plug in the values:

<prompt_2.1> Calculate the value of b using the relationship between a, b, and c. </prompt_2.1>

But let me double-check if the hyperbola equation is correctly oriented. Since the foci are on the horizontal line y = 2, the hyperbola opens left and right, so the x-term is positive, which matches the given form in the problem statement: \(\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1\). So that's correct.
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
c² = a² + b²
13² = 12² + b²
169 = 144 + b²
Subtract 144 from both sides: b² = 169 - 144 = 25. Therefore, b = 5.

Based on execution_2.1:
Wait, but hold on. Let me verify if I applied the definition correctly.
The problem states |PF1 - PF2| = 24. In hyperbola terms, this is 2a, so yes, a = 24/2 = 12. That's right.

Now, the center (h, k) is (-3, 2). So h = -3, k = 2.

Then, a is 12, b is 5. Therefore, h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5. Let me compute that:

<prompt_3.1> Calculate the sum h + k + a + b. </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
-3 + 2 = -1

-1 + 12 = 11

11 + 5 = 16.

Based on execution_3.1:
Wait, but let me just go through the steps again to make sure I didn't skip anything or make a mistake.

<prompt_4.1> Review the steps to ensure no mistakes were made. </prompt_4.1>

But let me check if the hyperbola equation is correctly written with these parameters. The center is (h, k) = (-3, 2).

<prompt_4.2> Verify the hyperbola equation and the sum h + k + a + b. </prompt_4.2>

But just to be thorough, let me verify with an example point. Suppose we take a point on the hyperbola where x is at the vertex. The vertices are located at (h ± a, k). Since the hyperbola opens left and right, the vertices are 12 units left and right from the center. The center is at (-3, 2), so the vertices are at (-3 + 12, 2) = (9, 2) and (-3 - 12, 2) = (-15, 2). Let's check the distance difference from these points to the foci.

<prompt_4.3> Verify the hyperbola equation by checking the distance difference for example points. </prompt_4.3>

<execution_4.1>
1. Found the midpoint of the foci: correct, since midpoint formula is average of x and average of y. Got (-3, 2).
2. Calculated distance between foci: 26, so c = 13. Correct.
3. Since |PF1 - PF2| = 24, so 2a = 24, so a = 12. Correct.
4. Then, using c² = a² + b², solved for b² = c² - a² = 169 - 144 = 25, so b = 5. Correct.
5. Then, sum h + k + a + b: -3 + 2 + 12 + 5 = 16.
</execution_4.1>

<execution_4.2>
So the equation is \(\frac{(x - (-3))^2}{12^2} - \frac{(y - 2)^2}{5^2} = 1\), which simplifies to \(\frac{(x + 3)^2}{144} - \frac{(y - 2)^2}{25} = 1\). That seems correct.

Therefore, h = -3, k = 2, a = 12, b = 5. Adding them together: -3 + 2 + 12 + 5 = 16.
</execution_4.2>

<execution_4.3>
Take the vertex (9, 2). Let's compute |PF1 - PF2|.

PF1 is the distance from (9, 2) to (10, 2): |9 - 10| = 1.

PF2 is the distance from (9, 2) to (-16, 2): |9 - (-16)| = |25| = 25.

So |1 - 25| = 24, which matches the given condition. Similarly, check the other vertex (-15, 2):

PF1 is distance from (-15, 2) to (10, 2): |-15 - 10| = |-25| = 25.

PF2 is distance from (-15, 2) to (-16, 2): |-15 - (-16)| = |1| = 1.

So |25 - 1| = 24, which also works.

<Final_answer>
Therefore, the sum of $h + k + a + b$ is $\boxed{16}$.
