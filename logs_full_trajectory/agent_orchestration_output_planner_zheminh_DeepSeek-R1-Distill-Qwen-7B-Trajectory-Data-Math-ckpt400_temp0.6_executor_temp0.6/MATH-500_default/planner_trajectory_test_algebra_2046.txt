Okay, let's see. I need to expand and simplify this algebraic expression completely. The expression is x times (x times (1 + x) plus 2x) minus 3 times (x² - x + 2). Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but I'll take it step by step.

First, maybe I should handle the innermost parentheses. Let me rewrite the expression to make it clearer.
The original expression is:

x[ x(1 + x) + 2x ] - 3(x² - x + 2)

So, starting with the innermost part: x(1 + x). Let me compute that first.

<prompt_1.1> Simplify the innermost expression x(1 + x) and distribute the multiplication over addition. </prompt_1.1>

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to approach the problem. Let me try expanding all the terms first without combining like terms until the end.

<prompt_1.2> Try expanding the expression using an alternative method by expanding all terms first. </prompt_1.2>

Alternatively, maybe another approach: expanding the entire expression without combining like terms until the end.

<prompt_1.3> Try expanding the expression using another alternative method by expanding all terms first. </prompt_1.3>

That would be x*1 + x*x, which is x + x². Right? So, replacing that part, the expression inside the first bracket becomes x + x² + 2x. Wait, because the original expression inside the first bracket is x(1 + x) + 2x. So after computing x(1 + x) as x + x², then adding 2x to that. So x + x² + 2x. Let me combine those like terms. x + 2x is 3x, so the first bracket simplifies to x² + 3x. So now the expression becomes x multiplied by (x² + 3x), right?
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
Original expression:

x[ x(1 + x) + 2x ] - 3(x² - x + 2)

First, expand x(1 + x):

x*1 + x*x = x + x²

Then, substitute back into the original expression:

x[ (x + x²) + 2x ] - 3(x² - x + 2)

Combine like terms inside the brackets:

(x + 2x) + x² = 3x + x²

So now the expression becomes:

x(3x + x²) - 3(x² - x + 2)

Now, distribute the x into (3x + x²):

x*3x + x*x² = 3x² + x³

So now, the expression is:

3x² + x³ - 3(x² - x + 2)

Next, distribute the -3 across the terms in the parentheses:

-3*x² + (-3)*(-x) + (-3)*2 = -3x² + 3x -6

Now, combine this with the previous terms:

3x² + x³ -3x² +3x -6

Combine like terms:

3x² -3x² = 0, so those cancel out. Then we have x³ +3x -6.

Wait, but the original expression is x[ x(1 + x) + 2x ] - 3(x² - x + 2). Let's see if there's another way to expand this. Maybe distribute the x into both terms inside the brackets first. Let's try:

x[ x(1 + x) + 2x ] = x * x(1 + x) + x * 2x = x²(1 + x) + 2x². Then, expanding x²(1 + x) gives x² + x³. So, adding 2x² gives x³ + 3x². Then subtract 3(x² - x + 2) which is -3x² + 3x -6. So combining all terms: x³ + 3x² -3x² +3x -6. The 3x² and -3x² cancel, leading to x³ +3x -6. Same result.

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Now, multiplying x by each term inside the bracket: x times x² is x³, and x times 3x is 3x².
So that part becomes x³ + 3x².

Now, the entire expression is simplified to x³ + 3x² minus 3 times (x² - x + 2). Let me handle the second part now.
So, distribute the -3 across each term inside the parentheses. Let's do that term by term.

<prompt_2.1> Distribute the -3 across each term inside the parentheses x² - x + 2. </prompt_2.1>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
First term: -3 times x² is -3x².

Second term: -3 times (-x) is +3x.

Third term: -3 times 2 is -6.

So, after distributing the -3, we have -3x² + 3x - 6.
</execution_2.1>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Putting it all together, the expression is now:

x³ + 3x² - 3x² + 3x - 6

Now, let's combine like terms. The 3x² and -3x² are like terms.
Adding those together gives 0. So they cancel each other out. That leaves us with x³ + 3x - 6.

Hmm, let me check if I did everything correctly. Let's go through each step again.

<prompt_3.1> Review each step of the simplification process to verify the result. </prompt_3.1>

Is there any other term I might have missed? Let's see.

<prompt_3.2> Check for any missed terms or errors in the distribution process. </prompt_3.2>

Wait, but I should check once more. Maybe substitute a value for x to see if both the original expression and the simplified one give the same result.

Let's try x = 1.

<prompt_3.3> Substitute x = 1 into both the original and simplified expressions to verify they give the same result. </prompt_3.3>

Let me try another value, x = 0.

<prompt_3.4> Substitute x = 0 into both the original and simplified expressions to verify they give the same result. </prompt_3.4>

Maybe x = -1.

<prompt_3.5> Substitute x = -1 into both the original and simplified expressions to verify they give the same result. </prompt_3.5>

Starting with the original expression:

x[ x(1 + x) + 2x ] - 3(x² - x + 2)

First step: compute x(1 + x). That's x*1 + x*x = x + x². Correct.

Then, adding 2x to that: x + x² + 2x = x² + 3x. That seems right.

Multiply by x: x*(x² + 3x) = x³ + 3x². Correct.

Then, distributing -3: -3x² + 3x -6. Yes, because -3 times -x is +3x. Correct.

Combine all terms: x³ + 3x² -3x² +3x -6. The 3x² and -3x² do cancel, so we have x³ +3x -6.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
Starting with the original expression: x[ x(1 + x) + 2x ] - 3(x² - x + 2)

First, x(1 + x) is x + x². Then adding 2x gives x + x² + 2x = x² + 3x. Multiplying by x gives x³ + 3x². Then subtracting 3(x² - x + 2) which becomes -3x² + 3x -6. So combining all terms: x³ + 3x² -3x² +3x -6. The 3x² and -3x² do cancel, leaving x³ +3x -6.
</execution_3.2>

<execution_3.3>
Original expression:

1[1(1 + 1) + 2*1] - 3(1² - 1 + 2)

Compute inside step by step:

1(1 + 1) = 1*2 = 2

Then 2 + 2*1 = 2 + 2 = 4

Multiply by 1: 1*4 = 4

Now compute the second part: 3(1 -1 + 2) = 3(2) = 6

Subtract that: 4 - 6 = -2

Simplified expression: 1³ + 3*1 -6 = 1 + 3 -6 = -2. Same result.
</execution_3.3>

<execution_3.4>
Original expression:

1[1(1 + 1) + 2*1] -3(1² -1 +2) = 1[1*2 + 2] -3(1 -1 +2) = 1[2 + 2] -3(2) = 1*4 -6 = 4 -6 = -2.

Simplified expression:

1³ + 3*1 -6 = 1 +3 -6 = -2.
</execution_3.4>

<execution_3.5>
Original expression:

0[0(1 + 0) + 2*0] -3(0² -0 +2) = 0[0 +0] -3(0 -0 +2) = 0 -3(2) = -6. Simplified expression: 0 +0 -6 = -6. Correct.
</execution_3.5>
</Execution_3>

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.3, execution_3.4, execution_3.5:
Okay, so after expanding and simplifying all the terms step by step, and checking with multiple values of x, I'm confident that the simplified form is x³ +3x -6.
There are no like terms left to combine, so this should be the final answer.

**Final Answer**
The simplified expression is \boxed{x^3 + 3x - 6}.
