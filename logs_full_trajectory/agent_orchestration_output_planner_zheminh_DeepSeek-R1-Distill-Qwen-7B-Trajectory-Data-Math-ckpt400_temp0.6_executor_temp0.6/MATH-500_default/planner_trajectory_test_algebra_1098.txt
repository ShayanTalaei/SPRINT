</Question>

<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to evaluate the expression (1 + 2i)6 - 3i. Hmm, let me start by understanding what the problem is asking. It looks like I have to perform complex number arithmetic here. The expression is (1 + 2i) multiplied by 6, and then subtract 3i from the result. Let me break this down step by step to make sure I don't make any mistakes.

First, let's handle the multiplication part: (1 + 2i) times 6. When multiplying a complex number by a real number, I can distribute the multiplication across both the real and imaginary parts. So, 6 times 1 is 6, and 6 times 2i is 12i. So that part should be straightforward.
So, (1 + 2i) * 6 = 6 + 12i.

Now, the next step is to subtract 3i from this result. So, taking the previous result, 6 + 12i, and subtracting 3i from it. Let me write that out: (6 + 12i) - 3i. 

When subtracting complex numbers, I need to combine like terms. The real parts stay together, and the imaginary parts stay together. Here, the real part is 6, and the imaginary parts are 12i and -3i. So, combining the imaginary parts: 12i - 3i.
Let me compute that. 12 minus 3 is 9, so that's 9i. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 6 + 9i.

Wait a second, let me check that again to make sure I didn't miss anything. The original expression is (1 + 2i) multiplied by 6, then subtract 3i. So, expanding the first term: 1*6 = 6, 2i*6 = 12i. Then subtract 3i: 12i - 3i = 9i.

But maybe I should write it out in a more detailed form to ensure there's no mistake. Let's represent the complex numbers and perform the operations step by step.

<prompt_1.1> Re-evaluate the expression using the detailed form method. </prompt_1.1>

Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as distributing the multiplication and subtraction. Let me try another approach. Let's consider the entire expression: (1 + 2i)6 - 3i. This can be rewritten as 6*(1 + 2i) - 3i. 

Alternatively, factor out the 3 from the terms involving i. Let's see: 6*(1 + 2i) - 3i = 6*1 + 6*2i - 3i = 6 + (12i - 3i) = 6 + 9i. That's the same result as before.

Wait, but maybe there's another way to approach this. Suppose I first combine the terms involving i before multiplying. Let me see. The original expression is (1 + 2i)6 - 3i. If I think of it as 6*(1 + 2i) - 3i, perhaps I can factor out a 3i term?

<prompt_1.2> Explore another approach by factoring out the 3i term. </prompt_1.2>

Alternatively, maybe I can check using rectangular form arithmetic. Let's represent the complex numbers as a + bi and perform the operations.

<execution_1.1>
Original expression: (1 + 2i) * 6 - 3i.

First, distribute the 6: 1*6 + 2i*6 = 6 + 12i. Then, subtract 3i: 6 + 12i - 3i. Combining the imaginary parts: 12i - 3i = 9i. So, the final result is 6 + 9i.
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
But perhaps that's complicating it. Let's see: 6*(1 + 2i) is 6 + 12i, then subtract 3i gives 6 + 12i - 3i = 6 + 9i.
</execution_1.2>

<execution_1.3>
First, (1 + 2i) multiplied by 6: 

6*(1) = 6

6*(2i) = 12i

So, adding those together gives 6 + 12i.

Then, subtracting 3i: 

6 + 12i - 3i = 6 + (12i - 3i) = 6 + 9i.

Based on execution_1.1, execution_1.2, execution_1.3:
Let me verify once more to ensure there are no arithmetic errors. Let's compute 1*6: that's 6.

<prompt_2.1> Verify the result once more to ensure no arithmetic errors. </prompt_2.1>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
2i*6: that's 12i.

Then subtract 3i: 12i - 3i = 9i. So, adding that to 6 gives 6 + 9i.
</execution_2.1>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Wait, but let me consider if there's any possibility of mixing up the real and imaginary parts. For example, if I had added instead of multiplied or something.

<prompt_3.1> Consider the possibility of mixing up real and imaginary parts. </prompt_3.1>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
But in this case, the multiplication is straightforward, and the subtraction is only on the imaginary component. So, no, the real parts are only from the 6, and the imaginary parts are 12i and -3i. So, combining them correctly gives 9i.

</Execution_3>

<Final_answer>
Therefore, the final answer is $\boxed{6+9i}$.
