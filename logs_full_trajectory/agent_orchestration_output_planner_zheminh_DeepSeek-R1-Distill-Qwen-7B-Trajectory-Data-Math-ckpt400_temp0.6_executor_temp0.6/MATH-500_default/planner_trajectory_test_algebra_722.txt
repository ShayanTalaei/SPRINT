Okay, let's see. I need to compute 99 squared plus 99 plus 1 in my head. Hmm, how to approach this. Maybe breaking it down step by step.

<prompt_1.1> Calculate 99 squared by expanding (100 - 1)² and simplify the expression. </prompt_1.1>

But maybe there's another way to see this, using algebraic identities. Let me think. The expression is 99² + 99 + 1. If I factor something out, maybe?

<prompt_1.2> Explore alternative algebraic methods to compute 99² + 99 + 1, considering factoring and telescoping series. </prompt_1.2>

Alternatively, maybe recognizing that 99² + 99 + 1 is similar to the formula for the sum of a geometric series. The sum of a geometric series with three terms is a*(r³ - 1)/(r - 1). If r = 100, and a = 1, then 1 + 100 + 100² = (100³ - 1)/99. But wait, that's 1 + 100 + 10000 = (1000000 - 1)/99 = 999999/99 = 10101. But that's not directly helpful here.

First, 99 squared. I remember that squaring numbers close to 100 can be done using the formula (100 - 1)². Let's expand that. (100 - 1)² = 100² - 2*100*1 + 1² = 10000 - 200 + 1 = 9801. So 99² is 9801.
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
Wait, 99 is 100 - 1. Maybe substituting that in. Let's try expanding (100 - 1)² + (100 - 1) + 1. Let's compute each term:

(100 - 1)² = 100² - 2*100*1 + 1² = 10000 - 200 + 1 = 9801.

Then, (100 - 1) = 99.

So adding them up with the 1: 9801 + 99 + 1. Let's compute 9801 + 99 first. 9801 + 99 is like 9801 + 100 - 1 = 9901 - 1 = 9900. Then add the remaining 1: 9900 + 1 = 9901.

Wait, maybe if I set x = 99, then the expression becomes x² + x + 1. If I consider x³ - 1 = (x - 1)(x² + x + 1), so x² + x + 1 = (x³ - 1)/(x - 1). Let's try that. If x = 99, then (99³ - 1)/(99 - 1) = (99³ - 1)/98. But does that help me? Let's see. If I can compute 99³, subtract 1, then divide by 98. But 99³ is 99*99*99. Let's compute 99*99 first. 99*99 is 9801. Then 9801*99. Let's do 9801*100 = 980100, subtract 9801, so 980100 - 9801 = 970299. Then 970299 - 1 = 970298. Divide that by 98. 970298 ÷ 98. Let's see. 98*10000 = 980000. So 970298 is 980000 - 970298 = 9702. So 980000 - 970298 = 9702. So 98*10000 - 970298 = 9702. Wait, maybe this approach is more complicated. Let's divide 970298 by 98. 98 goes into 970298 how many times? 98*10000=980000, which is more than 970298. So 98*9900=98*(10000-100)=980000-9800=970200. Then 970298 - 970200 = 98. So 98*9900 + 98 = 98*(9900 +1)=98*9901=970298. Therefore, 970298 ÷98=9901. So according to this, x² +x +1=9901. Which matches the previous result.

Based on execution_1.1:
Wait, so now I have 9801 + 99 + 1. Let's add 9801 and 99 first.
9801 + 99. Hmm, 9801 + 100 would be 9901, right? But since it's 99, that's 100 - 1. So 9801 + 99 = 9801 + 100 - 1 = 9901 - 1 = 9900. Then add the remaining 1: 9900 + 1 = 9901. So the total is 9901?

Wait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 99 squared is 9801. Then 9801 + 99 is 9900, and 9900 + 1 is 9901.

Based on execution_1.2:
Is there another way to see this? Maybe by adding 99² + 99 first. 99² is 99*99. As I calculated before, that's 9801. Then 9801 + 99 is 9900. Then adding 1 gives 9901.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. For example, n² + n + 1. If n = 99, then maybe this is related to (n+1)³ divided by something?

<prompt_2.1> Explore the pattern n² + n + 1 for n = 99 and verify the result. </prompt_2.1>

Wait, earlier with x = 99, we saw that x² + x + 1 = (x³ - 1)/(x - 1). Let's check that. If x = 99, then (99³ - 1)/98. But we already found that this equals 9901. So that's another way to see it. But maybe that's overcomplicating for someone trying to compute it mentally.

Let me see if there's a simpler way. If I consider that 99 is 100 - 1, maybe expanding (100 - 1)^2 + (100 - 1) + 1. Let's compute each term:

(100 - 1)^2 = 100² - 2*100*1 + 1 = 10000 - 200 + 1 = 9801.

Then (100 - 1) = 99.

So adding all together: 9801 + 99 + 1. Let's add 9801 + 99 first. As before, 9801 + 99 = 9900. Then 9900 + 1 = 9901. Yep, same result.

Based on execution_2.1, execution_1.3:
So regardless of the method—direct computation, expanding the square, or using algebraic identities—the result is 9901. Let me just verify once again with a different approach to be thorough.

Alternatively, maybe compute 99*100 and adjust.

Wait, 99*100 is 9900. Then 99*99 is 99*(100 -1) = 9900 - 99 = 9801. Then adding 99 gives 9801 + 99 = 9900. Then add 1. Yep, same thing. So all approaches lead to 9901. I think that's solid. No mistakes detected in the reasoning. So the final answer should be 9901.
