</Question>

<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to find the greatest integer less than (sqrt(7) + sqrt(5))^6. Hmm, that seems a bit tricky without a calculator. Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can use binomial expansion? But expanding (sqrt(7) + sqrt(5))^6 directly might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a clever way to express this in terms of powers that can be simplified?

Wait, I remember that expressions like (sqrt(a) + sqrt(b))^n can sometimes be paired with their conjugates. For example, (sqrt(7) - sqrt(5))^6. If I add these two expressions, maybe the irrational parts cancel out, leaving an integer?
Let me test this idea.

Let’s denote x = sqrt(7) + sqrt(5) and y = sqrt(7) - sqrt(5). Then, x^6 + y^6 might be an integer. Since y is less than 1 (because sqrt(7) ≈ 2.645 and sqrt(5) ≈ 2.236, so y ≈ 0.409), raising it to the 6th power would make it very small.
Therefore, x^6 + y^6 is an integer, and since y^6 is positive but less than 1, x^6 must be that integer minus a fraction, so the greatest integer less than x^6 is the integer minus 1.

So, if I can compute x^6 + y^6, then subtract 1, that should give me the answer.

But how do I compute x^6 + y^6 without expanding directly? Maybe using recurrence relations or some formula. Let me recall that for x = sqrt(7) + sqrt(5) and y = sqrt(7) - sqrt(5), we can find a relation between x and y. Notice that x + y = 2*sqrt(7) and x - y = 2*sqrt(5). Also, multiplying x and y gives (sqrt(7))^2 - (sqrt(5))^2 = 7 - 5 = 2. So xy = 2.

Also, x^2 + y^2 can be computed as (x + y)^2 - 2xy. Let's compute that.

But wait, let me verify this step-by-step to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let's recalculate each step carefully.

<prompt_1.2> Recalculate each step of the calculation to verify the result. </prompt_1.2>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
First, x + y = 2*sqrt(7), so (x + y)^2 = 4*7 = 28. Then, 2xy = 2*2 = 4. Therefore, x^2 + y^2 = 28 - 4 = 24.
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
First, x = sqrt(7) + sqrt(5), y = sqrt(7) - sqrt(5).

x + y = 2*sqrt(7)

x - y = 2*sqrt(5)

xy = (sqrt(7))^2 - (sqrt(5))^2 = 7 - 5 = 2. Correct.

Now, compute x^2 + y^2:

x^2 + y^2 = (x + y)^2 - 2xy = (2*sqrt(7))^2 - 2*2 = 4*7 - 4 = 28 - 4 = 24. Correct.

Then, x^3 + y^3 = (x + y)(x^2 + y^2 - xy) = 2*sqrt(7)*(24 - 2) = 2*sqrt(7)*22 = 44*sqrt(7). Correct.

x^4 + y^4: Let's use the recurrence. We know x^2 + y^2 =24, and x^4 + y^4 = (x^2 + y^2)^2 - 2(xy)^2 = 24^2 - 2*(2)^2 = 576 - 8 = 568. Correct.

x^5 + y^5: Using recurrence, (x + y)(x^4 + y^4) - (xy)(x^3 + y^3). So 2*sqrt(7)*568 - 2*(44*sqrt(7)) = 1136*sqrt(7) - 88*sqrt(7) = 1048*sqrt(7). Correct.

x^6 + y^6: Using recurrence, (x + y)(x^5 + y^5) - (xy)(x^4 + y^4). So 2*sqrt(7)*1048*sqrt(7) - 2*568. Compute each term:

First term: 2*sqrt(7)*1048*sqrt(7) = 2*1048*7 = 2*7336 = 14672.

Second term: 2*568 = 1136.

Therefore, x^6 + y^6 = 14672 - 1136 = 13536. Correct.

Then, since y^6 is positive and less than 1, x^6 is 13536 - y^6, so the floor of x^6 is 13535. Correct.

Therefore, the answer should be 13535.

Based on execution_1.1:
Next, x^2 * y^2 = (xy)^2 = 4. So, x^2 + y^2 = 24 and x^2 * y^2 = 4. Now, maybe x^4 + y^4 can be found using (x^2 + y^2)^2 - 2x^2y^2 = 24^2 - 2*4 = 576 - 8 = 568.

Let me verify that. (x^2 + y^2)^2 = x^4 + 2x^2y^2 + y^4, so x^4 + y^4 = (x^2 + y^2)^2 - 2x^2y^2.
Yes, that's correct.

Okay, so x^4 + y^4 = 568.

Now, moving on to x^5 + y^5. Maybe we can use the recurrence relation here. Let me recall that for sequences like x^n + y^n, there's a recurrence based on x + y and xy.

<prompt_2.1> Use the recurrence relation to find x^5 + y^5 and verify the result. </prompt_2.1>

Based on execution_1.2:
But let me check with another approach just to be sure. Maybe compute x^6 numerically with approximations, then take the floor.

<prompt_2.2> Use numerical approximation to verify the result of x^6. </prompt_2.2>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
The recurrence is x^n + y^n = (x + y)(x^{n-1} + y^{n-1}) - xy(x^{n-2} + y^{n-2}).

So, using this, since we have x^4 + y^4 and x^3 + y^3, we can compute x^5 + y^5 as (x + y)(x^4 + y^4) - xy(x^3 + y^3). Let's compute that.

x + y = 2*sqrt(7), which is approximately, but maybe we can keep it exact for now. So, (2*sqrt(7))*568 - 2*(44*sqrt(7)) = 1136*sqrt(7) - 88*sqrt(7) = (1136 - 88)*sqrt(7) = 1048*sqrt(7). Hmm, but let's keep it exact for now.

Then x^5 + y^5 = 1048*sqrt(7).

Now, x^6 + y^6 can be computed as (x + y)(x^5 + y^5) - xy(x^4 + y^4). Let's compute that:

(x + y)(x^5 + y^5) = 2*sqrt(7) * 1048*sqrt(7) = 2*1048*7 = 2*7336 = 14672.

Then subtract xy*(x^4 + y^4) = 2*568 = 1136.

Therefore, x^6 + y^6 = 14672 - 1136 = 13536.

<execution_2.2>
Let's see. sqrt(7) ≈ 2.64575131105, sqrt(5) ≈ 2.2360679775. So x = sqrt(7) + sqrt(5) ≈ 2.64575131105 + 2.2360679775 ≈ 4.88181928855.

Then x^6 ≈ (4.88181928855)^6. Let's compute step by step:

First, compute x^2: (4.88181928855)^2 ≈ 23.8333333333 (since 4.88181928855 is approximately 22/7 - wait, 22/7 is about 3.1428, which is pi, but here 4.8818 is roughly sqrt(23.8333)). Wait, actually, sqrt(23.8333) is approximately 4.8818, yes.

Then x^3 = x^2 * x ≈ 23.8333333333 * 4.88181928855 ≈ Let's compute 23.8333 * 4.8818. 23 * 4 = 92, 23 * 0.8818 ≈ 20.2814, 0.8333 * 4 ≈ 3.3332, 0.8333 * 0.8818 ≈ 0.7347. Adding all together: 92 + 20.2814 + 3.3332 + 0.7347 ≈ 116.35. So x^3 ≈ 116.35.

Then x^6 = (x^3)^2 ≈ (116.35)^2. Let's compute that. 100^2 = 10,000, 16.35^2 ≈ 267.32, and 2*100*16.35 = 3270. So total ≈ 10,000 + 3,270 + 267.32 ≈ 13,537.32. But wait, this is an overestimation because x^3 was approximated as 116.35. Let's check with calculator steps:

x ≈ 4.88181928855

x^2 = (4.88181928855)^2 = exactly (sqrt(7) + sqrt(5))^2 = 7 + 2*sqrt(35) + 5 = 12 + 2*sqrt(35). Since sqrt(35) ≈ 5.9160797831, so 2*sqrt(35) ≈ 11.8321595662. Therefore, x^2 ≈ 12 + 11.8321595662 ≈ 23.8321595662. So my earlier approximation was a bit high. Let's use 23.8321595662.

Then x^3 = x^2 * x ≈ 23.8321595662 * 4.88181928855. Let's compute this more accurately:

23.8321595662 * 4 = 95.3286382648

23.8321595662 * 0.88181928855 ≈ Let's break this down:

First, 23.8321595662 * 0.8 = 19.06572765296

23.8321595662 * 0.08 = 1.9065727653

23.8321595662 * 0.00181928855 ≈ ~0.0433

Adding these: 19.06572765296 + 1.9065727653 ≈ 20.9723004183 + 0.0433 ≈ 21.0156

So total x^3 ≈ 95.3286382648 + 21.0156 ≈ 116.3442382648. So x^3 ≈ 116.3442.

Then x^6 = (x^3)^2 ≈ (116.3442)^2. Let's compute this:

116^2 = 13,456

2*116*0.3442 = 232*0.3442 ≈ 232*0.3 = 69.6, 232*0.0442 ≈ 10.264, total ≈ 69.6 + 10.264 ≈ 79.864

(0.3442)^2 ≈ 0.1185

Adding all together: 13,456 + 79.864 + 0.1185 ≈ 13,535.9825. So approximately 13,535.9825.

Therefore, x^6 ≈ 13,535.9825, so the greatest integer less than x^6 is 13,535. That matches our previous result. So that seems correct.

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
But we need to subtract y^6 to get x^6. Since y is less than 1, y^6 is a positive number less than 1. Therefore, x^6 = 13536 - y^6. Hence, the integer part of x^6 is 13536 - 1 = 13535. Therefore, the greatest integer less than (sqrt(7) + sqrt(5))^6 is 13535.

Let me verify this step-by-step to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

First, confirming x and y:

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
x = sqrt(7) + sqrt(5) ≈ 2.6458 + 2.2361 ≈ 4.8819

y = sqrt(7) - sqrt(5) ≈ 2.6458 - 2.2361 ≈ 0.4097

Then, y^6 ≈ (0.4097)^6. Let's compute that:

0.4097^2 ≈ 0.1679

0.1679^2 ≈ 0.02819

0.02819 * 0.1679 ≈ 0.00474. So y^6 ≈ 0.00474. Therefore, x^6 = 13536 - 0.00474 ≈ 13535.99526. Therefore, the floor of x^6 is indeed 13535.
