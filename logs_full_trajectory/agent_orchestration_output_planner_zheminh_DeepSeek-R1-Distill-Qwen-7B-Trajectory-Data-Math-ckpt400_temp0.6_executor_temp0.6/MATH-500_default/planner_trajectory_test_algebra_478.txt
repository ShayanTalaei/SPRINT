<Question>
The volume of a cone is given by the formula $V = \frac{1}{3}Bh$, where $B$ is the area of the base and $h$ is the height. The area of the base of a cone is 30 square units, and its height is 6.5 units. What is the number of cubic units in its volume?

Okay, so I need to find the volume of a cone. The formula given is V = (1/3)Bh, where B is the area of the base and h is the height. Let me make sure I remember this correctly. Cones have a circular base, right? So the area of the base would be the area of a circle, which is πr². But wait, the problem already gives me the area of the base as 30 square units. That's helpful because I don't have to calculate the radius or anything. So I can just use B = 30 here.

The height is given as 6.5 units. So plugging these into the formula, the volume should be (1/3) multiplied by 30 multiplied by 6.5.
Let me write that out step by step to avoid mistakes.

First, let me recall the formula again: V = (1/3) * B * h. Substituting the given values, B is 30 and h is 6.5.

So, V = (1/3) * 30 * 6.5. Let me compute this. Let's do the multiplication step by step. First, multiply 30 by 6.5. Then take that result and multiply by 1/3.

Calculating 30 * 6.5. Hmm, 30 times 6 is 180, and 30 times 0.5 is 15. So adding those together, 180 + 15 = 195. So 30 * 6.5 is 195. Then, multiplying that by 1/3 gives V = 195 * (1/3).

Based on execution_1.1:
Let me compute 195 divided by 3.

<prompt_2.1> Divide 195 by 3 to find the volume. </prompt_2.1>

Wait, let me check if I did that right. Alternatively, maybe I can simplify before multiplying. Let's see: (1/3) * 30 * 6.5. The 30 and the 1/3 can be simplified first.

<prompt_2.2> Simplify the calculation by simplifying 30 and 1/3 before multiplying. </prompt_2.2>

Alternatively, if I do 30 * 6.5 first, which is 195, then divide by 3, which is 65.
Either way, the answer is 65.

<execution_2.1>
Let's divide 195 by 3. 3 goes into 19 six times (3*6=18), remainder 1. Bring down the 5 to make 15. 3 goes into 15 five times. So that's 65. So 195 divided by 3 is 65. Therefore, the volume is 65 cubic units.

<execution_2.2>
Since 30 divided by 3 is 10. So that simplifies to 10 * 6.5. Which is 65. Oh, that's easier. So either way, whether I do 30*6.5 first and then divide by 3, or divide 30 by 3 first to get 10 and then multiply by 6.5, I end up with 65.

Based on execution_2.1:
Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Let's verify each step again.

<prompt_3.1> Verify the calculations for 30 * 6.5 and 195 / 3. </prompt_3.1>

Based on execution_2.1, execution_2.2:
But let me just confirm once more. If the area of the base is 30, height is 6.5, then volume is (1/3)*30*6.5.

<prompt_3.2> Confirm the final result using the formula with given values. </prompt_3.2>

<execution_3.1>
First, area of the base is 30, height is 6.5. The formula for the volume of a cone is one-third times the base area times height. So substituting the numbers: 1/3 * 30 * 6.5. Multiplication is commutative, so I can rearrange these numbers as needed. For instance, 1/3 of 30 is 10, so 10 * 6.5 is 65.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
So, 30 divided by 3 is 10, 10 multiplied by 6.5 is 65. Yep, that's right. Alternatively, 6.5 times 10 is 65, then times (1/3) would be 65/3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the order of operations. Wait, no. The formula is (1/3) multiplied by 30 multiplied by 6.5. So it's (1/3)*(30*6.5). But 30*6.5 is 195, then 195*(1/3) is 65. Alternatively, (1/3)*30 is 10, then 10*6.5 is 65. Either way, same result. So that seems consistent.

Is there any chance I messed up the decimal multiplication? Let's see. 6.5 times 30. 6.5 is the same as 6 + 0.5. So 6*30 = 180, 0.5*30 = 15. 180 +15 = 195. Then 195 divided by 3 is 65.

<Final_answer>
Therefore, the number of cubic units in the volume of the cone is $\boxed{65}$.
