Okay, so I need to solve the equation |5x - 1| = x + 3 and find the largest value of x that satisfies it. Hmm, absolute value equations can sometimes have two solutions, right? Because the absolute value makes both positive and negative versions equal. So maybe I need to consider two cases here. Let me think through this step by step.

First, let me recall that if |A| = B, then A = B or A = -B. So applying that to this equation, |5x - 1| = x + 3 would mean that either 5x - 1 = x + 3 or 5x - 1 = -(x + 3). That gives me two separate equations to solve. But I also need to remember that the right-hand side, which is x + 3, must be non-negative because absolute values are always non-negative. So, x + 3 ≥ 0, which implies x ≥ -3. That's an important condition to check later because even if I get solutions from the two equations, they have to satisfy x ≥ -3.

Let me start with the first case: 5x - 1 = x + 3.

<prompt_1.1> Solve the equation 5x - 1 = x + 3 and check if the solution satisfies x ≥ -3. </prompt_1.1>

Now onto the second case: 5x - 1 = -(x + 3). Let's solve that.

<prompt_1.2> Solve the equation 5x - 1 = -(x + 3) and check if the solution satisfies x ≥ -3. </prompt_1.2>

<execution_1.1>
Subtract x from both sides: 4x - 1 = 3. Then add 1 to both sides: 4x = 4. Divide by 4: x = 1. So that's one solution, x = 1. Let me check if that's valid by plugging back into the original equation. Left side: |5*1 - 1| = |5 - 1| = |4| = 4. Right side: 1 + 3 = 4. Yep, 4 = 4. So that works.
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
Distribute the negative sign on the right side: 5x - 1 = -x - 3. Now, let's get all the x terms on one side and constants on the other. Add x to both sides: 5x + x - 1 = -3. That simplifies to 6x - 1 = -3. Then add 1 to both sides: 6x = -3 + 1 = -2. So, 6x = -2. Dividing both sides by 6 gives x = -2/6 = -1/3. So the second solution is x = -1/3. Let me check if this satisfies x ≥ -3.

Based on execution_1.1, execution_1.2:
-1/3 is approximately -0.333, which is greater than -3, so that's okay. But I also need to check if this solution works in the original equation because sometimes when we square both sides or manipulate absolute values, we might introduce extraneous solutions.

Let me verify x = -1/3 in the original equation |5x - 1| = x + 3.

<prompt_2.1> Verify the solution x = -1/3 in the original equation |5x - 1| = x + 3. </prompt_2.1>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Left side: |5*(-1/3) - 1| = |-5/3 - 1| = |-5/3 - 3/3| = |-8/3| = 8/3. Right side: (-1/3) + 3 = (-1/3) + (9/3) = 8/3. So 8/3 = 8/3. That works too.
</execution_2.1>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
So the two solutions are x = 1 and x = -1/3. The problem asks for the largest value of x, so between 1 and -1/3, the largest is 1. Therefore, the answer should be 1.

But wait, let me just make sure I didn't miss any other possible solutions or constraints.

<prompt_3.1> Confirm the solutions and ensure no other solutions or constraints are missed. </prompt_3.1>

Let me just visualize the graphs to confirm. The left side is |5x - 1|, which is a V-shaped graph with vertex where 5x -1 =0, so x=1/5. The right side is x +3, which is a straight line with slope 1 intercepting the y-axis at 3.

<prompt_3.2> Visualize the graphs of |5x - 1| and x + 3 to confirm the solutions. </prompt_3.2>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
Sometimes when dealing with absolute values, there can be cases where the right-hand side must be non-negative, which we considered by x ≥ -3. But since both solutions x =1 and x = -1/3 are greater than -3, that's fine. Also, when solving the second case, we didn't square both sides or anything, just linear equations, so no extraneous solutions were introduced there.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
They should intersect at two points, which correspond to the two solutions we found. The points of intersection are at x=1 and x=-1/3. Since the V-shape of the absolute value graph can intersect the line on both sides of the vertex, that makes sense. The vertex of the absolute value graph is at x=1/5, which is between -1/3 and 1. So the two intersection points are on either side of the vertex, which is why there are two solutions.

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1, execution_3.2:
Therefore, confirming that the solutions are correct and the largest is indeed 1. I think that's thorough.
I considered both cases, checked the validity of each solution against the original equation, confirmed that they meet the domain requirement, and even did a quick graphical analysis to verify the number of solutions. No steps skipped, and all possible cases covered.
