Okay, so I need to simplify this expression: the square root of the cube root of the square root of 1/729. And then write the result with a rational denominator. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

<prompt_1.1> Simplify the expression by breaking it down step by step as per the above plan. </prompt_1.1>

<execution_1.1>
First, let me write it out in symbols to visualize better: √( ∛( √(1/729) ) ). Alright, starting from the inside, the innermost part is the square root of 1/729. I know that 729 is a perfect square because 27 times 27 is 729. Wait, no, 27 times 27 is 729? Let me check: 27 squared is 729, right? 27*27: 20*20=400, 20*7=140, 7*20=140, 7*7=49; adding those up: 400+140+140+49=729. Yes, so √(729) is 27. Therefore, √(1/729) would be 1/27. Because the square root of 1 is 1, and the square root of 729 is 27.

Based on execution_1.1:
So that simplifies the innermost part to 1/27. Now moving one layer out, we have the cube root of 1/27. Let's compute that.
The cube root of 1 is 1, and the cube root of 27 is 3, since 3 cubed is 27 (3*3=9, 9*3=27). So ∛(1/27) is 1/3.

Now the outermost layer is the square root of 1/3. So we have √(1/3).

But the problem says to write the result with a rational denominator. I remember that having a radical in the denominator is not considered proper form, so we need to rationalize the denominator.
To rationalize √(1/3), we can rewrite it as √1 / √3, which is 1/√3. To rationalize the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by √3: (1*√3)/(√3*√3) = √3/3. So √(1/3) simplifies to √3/3.

Wait, let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with the innermost radical: √(1/729).

<prompt_2.1> Verify each step of the simplification process as per the above plan. </prompt_2.1>

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this by combining the roots. Let's see. The original expression is √( ∛( √(1/729) ) ). Let's express all the roots as exponents. Remember that √a is a^(1/2), ∛a is a^(1/3), and so on. So starting from the inside: 1/729^(1/2) inside the cube root, then the square root of that.

<prompt_2.2> Simplify the expression using exponent rules as per the above plan. </prompt_2.2>

Another way to think about it: when you have nested roots, you can combine them by multiplying the exponents. So starting from the inside: the innermost is 1/729. Take the square root: exponent 1/2. Then take the cube root of that: exponent 1/3. Then take the square root of the entire thing: exponent 1/2. So overall exponent is (1/2)*(1/3)*(1/2) = 1/12.

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Since √(1/729) = 1/√729. But 729 is 27 squared, so √729 is 27, so indeed 1/27. Then the cube root of 1/27: ∛(1/27) = 1/∛27 = 1/3. Then the square root of 1/3 is 1/√3, which becomes √3/3 after rationalizing. That seems right.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
So let's write this as:

1. Innermost: (1/729)^(1/2)
2. Then, take the cube root of that result: [ (1/729)^(1/2) ]^(1/3)
3. Then, take the square root of the previous result: [ { (1/729)^(1/2) }^(1/3) ]^(1/2)

Alternatively, combining all exponents: (1/729)^(1/2 * 1/3 * 1/2) = (1/729)^(1/12). Wait, is that right? Let me confirm. When you have exponents applied one after another, you multiply them. So first exponent 1/2, then 1/3, then 1/2. So total exponent is 1/2 * 1/3 * 1/2 = (1*1*1)/(2*3*2) = 1/12. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to (1/729)^(1/12).
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
So 729^(1/12). Let's see if that gives the same result. 729 is 9^3, which is (3^2)^3 = 3^6. So 729 = 3^6. Then 729^(1/12) = (3^6)^(1/12) = 3^(6/12) = 3^(1/2) = √3. Then, since the original expression is the square root of the cube root of the square root, which we found to be 1/√3, but 1/√3 is the same as √3/3. Wait, but 729^(1/12) is 3^(1/2), which is √3. But in our original breakdown, we had √(1/3) which is 1/√3. Hmm, maybe there's a discrepancy here. Let me check again.

Based on execution_2.2:
But wait, if we do that, then (1/729)^(1/12). Let's compute that.

Based on execution_2.3:
Wait, no. Let's see. The original expression is √( ∛( √(1/729) ) ). If we express 1/729 as (1/3)^6, because 729 is 3^6, so 1/729 is (1/3)^6.

<prompt_3.2> Reconfirm the result using the alternative exponent method as per the above plan. </prompt_3.2>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
729 is 9^3, which is 3^6. So 1/729 is 3^(-6). Therefore, (3^(-6))^(1/12) = 3^(-6*(1/12)) = 3^(-1/2) = 1/3^(1/2) = 1/√3 = √3/3. Same result. So that's another way to get to the same answer.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
Then, taking the square root: ( (1/3)^6 )^(1/2) = (1/3)^(6*(1/2)) = (1/3)^3 = 1/27. Then, cube root of that: (1/3)^3^(1/3) = (1/3)^(3*(1/3)) = (1/3)^1 = 1/3. Then, square root of that: (1/3)^(1/2) = 1/√3 = √3/3. So same result. So whether I combine the exponents or compute step by step, I get √3/3.
</execution_3.2>
</Execution_3>

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
But let me confirm if combining the exponents is valid here. Each operation is a root, which is an exponentiation. So yes, when you have nested exponentials, you multiply the exponents. So that step is correct.
Therefore, both methods lead to the same answer, which is reassuring.

No prompt to execute.

<Final_answer>
Therefore, the simplified expression with a rational denominator is $\boxed{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}}$.
