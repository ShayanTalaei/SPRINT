Okay, so I need to find the smallest positive perfect cube that can be written as the sum of three consecutive integers. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem step by step. 

First, what exactly is a perfect cube? A perfect cube is a number that can be written as n³ where n is an integer. So, examples are 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, and so on. The question is asking for the smallest such number in this sequence that can be expressed as the sum of three consecutive integers.

Now, let's think about three consecutive integers. If I denote the middle integer as k, then the three consecutive integers would be k-1, k, and k+1. Adding these together: (k - 1) + k + (k + 1) = 3k. So, the sum of three consecutive integers is always three times the middle number. That simplifies things a bit.

Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the smallest positive perfect cube that is three times some integer. Because 3k must be a perfect cube, k would then be that perfect cube divided by 3. But since k has to be an integer, the perfect cube must be divisible by 3. So, the perfect cube has to be a multiple of 3.

Let me note that down: The sum is 3k, so 3k = n³. Therefore, n³ must be divisible by 3, which implies that n itself must be divisible by 3, because if a prime divides a cube, it must divide the base. Since 3 is prime, if 3 divides n³, then 3 divides n. Therefore, n can be written as 3m, where m is an integer.

Substituting back, n³ = (3m)³ = 27m³. Therefore, the sum 3k = 27m³, so k = 9m³. Therefore, the three consecutive integers would be 9m³ - 1, 9m³, and 9m³ + 1. Their sum is indeed 27m³, which is a perfect cube.

Now, we need the smallest positive perfect cube. Let's start with the smallest m. Since m is an integer, and we need the sum to be positive, m must be positive as well. Let's try m=1.

Then the sum is 27*(1)^3 = 27. The three consecutive integers would be 9*1 -1 = 8, 9*1 =9, 9*1 +1=10. So 8 +9 +10 =27. That works! So 27 is a perfect cube and is the sum of 8,9,10. 

But wait, is there a smaller positive perfect cube? Let's check the next smaller cubes. The cubes before 27 are 1, 8, 27. Let's see if any of these can be written as the sum of three consecutive integers. 

Starting with 1: Can 1 be written as the sum of three consecutive integers? Let's see. Let the three consecutive integers be a, a+1, a+2. Their sum is 3a +3 =1. So 3a = -2, which gives a = -2/3. But that's not an integer. So 1 cannot be expressed as the sum of three consecutive integers. 

Next, 8. Let's check if 8 can be written as such a sum. Using the same approach, 3a +3 =8. So 3a =5, which gives a=5/3. Again, not an integer. So 8 is out. 

So the next cube is 27, which we already saw works. Therefore, 27 is the answer.

Based on execution_1.1:
But let me just verify once more if there's another way. Suppose someone considers three consecutive integers not necessarily centered around k, but maybe starting at some other number. Wait, but three consecutive integers can always be written as k-1, k, k+1. So regardless of where you start, the sum is always 3k. Therefore, all such sums are multiples of 3, and in this case, the multiple is 3 times the middle term.

Therefore, the sum must be divisible by 3. So among the perfect cubes, the first one divisible by 3 is 27. Therefore, 27 is the answer.

But just to be thorough, let me check another approach. Let’s denote the three consecutive integers as n-1, n, n+1. Their sum is 3n. So, 3n must be a perfect cube. Therefore, n must be a perfect cube divided by 3. So, n = m³ /3. For n to be integer, m³ must be divisible by 3, so m must be divisible by 3.

Let m =3k, then n = (27k³)/3 =9k³. Therefore, the three integers are 9k³ -1, 9k³, 9k³ +1. Their sum is 27k³, which is (3k)^3. Therefore, the smallest such cube is when k=1, which gives 27*1=27. 

Therefore, this confirms the earlier result. So 27 is the smallest positive perfect cube that can be written as the sum of three consecutive integers.
