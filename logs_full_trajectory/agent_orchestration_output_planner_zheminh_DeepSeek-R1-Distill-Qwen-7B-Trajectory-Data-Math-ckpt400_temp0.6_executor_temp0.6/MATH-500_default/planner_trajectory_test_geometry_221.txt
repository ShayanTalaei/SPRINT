<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to find the length of the median QM in triangle PQR where PQ = QR = 34 and PR = 32. Let me start by recalling what a median is.
A median in a triangle is a line segment joining a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. So, QM is the median from vertex Q to the midpoint M of side PR.

First, let me visualize the triangle. Since PQ and QR are both 34, triangle PQR is isosceles with PQ = QR. That means the base is PR, which is 32 units long. So, vertex Q is opposite the base PR, and the two equal sides are PQ and QR.

Wait, hold on. If PQ = QR, then the triangle is isosceles with base PR. So, the two equal sides are PQ and QR, meeting at vertex Q.
Therefore, the base is PR, which is 32. So, the midpoint M of PR will divide it into two segments each of length 16.

Now, I need to find the length of the median QM. Since QM is a median in an isosceles triangle, maybe there's a property or theorem specific to isosceles triangles that can help here. Alternatively, I can use coordinate geometry or the Apollonius theorem, which relates the lengths of the sides of a triangle to the length of a median.

Let me recall Apollonius theorem.
It states that in any triangle, the sum of the squares of any two sides is equal to twice the square of the median to the third side plus twice the square of the half third side. Wait, maybe I should write it down.

For triangle PQR, with median QM, Apollonius theorem would say:

<prompt_1.1> Apply Apollonius theorem to find the length of the median QM. </prompt_1.1>

Alternatively, maybe I can confirm using coordinate geometry. Let me try that as a cross-check.

Let me place the base PR on the x-axis for simplicity. Let’s set point P at (-16, 0) and point R at (16, 0), so that PR is 32 units long (distance from -16 to 16 on the x-axis is 32). Then, the midpoint M of PR would be at (0, 0).

<prompt_1.2> Use coordinate geometry to find the length of the median QM by placing the triangle on the coordinate plane. </prompt_1.2>
-----

Alternatively, if I didn't recall Apollonius theorem, maybe I can use coordinate geometry or vector methods. Let me try using coordinates again.

Alternatively, place point Q somewhere in the plane. Since the triangle is isosceles with sides PQ = QR = 34 and base PR = 32, let's place points P and R on the x-axis as before.

<prompt_1.3> Use coordinate geometry to find the length of the median QM by placing the triangle on the coordinate plane. </prompt_1.3>

Alternatively, maybe using vectors. Let’s consider point P as the origin.

PR² + QR² = 2QM² + 2(PM)²

Wait, no, maybe I need to check again. Apollonius theorem formula is:

In any triangle, the sum of the squares of two sides is equal to twice the square of the median to the third side plus twice the square of the half third side.

So, in this case, sides PQ and QR are both 34. The median is QM to side PR, which is 32. So, according to Apollonius theorem:

PQ² + QR² = 2QM² + 2(PM)²

Since M is the midpoint of PR, PM = PR/2 = 16.

<execution_1.2>
Wait, but in that case, the midpoint M would be at (0, 0). Then, points P(-16, 0), R(16, 0), M(0, 0). Now, vertex Q is somewhere in the plane. Since PQ = QR = 34, point Q must be equidistant from P and R, which are at (-16, 0) and (16, 0). Therefore, Q lies somewhere on the perpendicular bisector of PR. Since PR is on the x-axis from (-16, 0) to (16, 0), the perpendicular bisector is the y-axis. Therefore, point Q must be somewhere along the y-axis. Let's denote Q as (0, y). Then, the distance from Q to P is 34.

Calculating the distance from Q(0, y) to P(-16, 0):

√[(0 - (-16))² + (y - 0)²] = √[(16)² + y²] = √(256 + y²) = 34.

So, √(256 + y²) = 34. Squaring both sides:

256 + y² = 34² = 1156.

Therefore, y² = 1156 - 256 = 900. So, y = 30 or y = -30. Since it's a triangle in standard position, let's take y = 30. So, Q is at (0, 30).

Now, the median QM is the distance from Q(0, 30) to M(0, 0), which is simply √[(0 - 0)² + (0 - 30)²] = √(0 + 900) = 30. So, the length of QM is 30.

<execution_1.3>
Let’s place point P at (-16, 0), R at (16, 0), midpoint M at (0,0). Then point Q is somewhere in the plane. Since PQ = QR = 34, point Q must be equidistant from P and R, which in this case, since PR is on the x-axis and the triangle is isosceles with base PR, point Q must lie somewhere along the y-axis. Wait, that's because in an isosceles triangle with base PR, the median from Q to PR is also the altitude and the angle bisector. So, Q is at (0, h) where h is the height.

So, let's compute h. The distance from Q to P is 34. The coordinates of P are (-16, 0), Q is (0, h). The distance PQ is sqrt[(0 - (-16))² + (h - 0)²] = sqrt[256 + h²] = 34. Therefore, sqrt[256 + h²] = 34. Squaring both sides, 256 + h² = 1156. Therefore, h² = 1156 - 256 = 900. So h = 30. Therefore, the coordinates of Q are (0, 30).

Then, the median QM is the distance from Q(0,30) to M(0,0), which is sqrt[(0 - 0)² + (0 - 30)²] = sqrt[900] = 30. So, the length of QM is 30.

<execution_1.4>
Wait, perhaps overcomplicating. Let me check another method.

Alternatively, using the law of cosines. Since the triangle is isosceles with sides PQ = QR = 34, base PR = 32. Let me first find one of the angles at the base, then use that to find the median. Hmm, but maybe that's more complicated.

Alternatively, in triangle PQR, since we know all three sides, we can compute the coordinates. Wait, we already did coordinate geometry. So, seems like Apollonius theorem is the most straightforward here.

Based on execution_1.1:
Then, plugging into the formula:

34² + 34² = 2QM² + 2(16)²

Let me compute each term.

<prompt_2.1> Solve the equation obtained from Apollonius theorem to find the length of the median QM. </prompt_2.1>

Based on execution_1.2:
Wait, that's the same answer as before. So, Apollonius theorem gives 30, coordinate geometry gives 30.

Based on execution_1.1:
Wait, is that right?

Wait, let me confirm Apollonius theorem again.

<prompt_2.2> Re-evaluate and confirm the application of Apollonius theorem to ensure the result is correct. </prompt_2.2>
-----

Based on execution_1.4:
Therefore, the answer is 30.

But just to make sure, let me check once again.

<prompt_2.3> Confirm the result using Apollonius theorem and ensure all calculations are correct. </prompt_2.3>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
34 squared is 34*34. Let me compute that. 30 squared is 900, 4 squared is 16, so (30+4)^2 = 30² + 2*30*4 + 4² = 900 + 240 + 16 = 1156. So, 34² = 1156.

So, left side is 1156 + 1156 = 2312.

Right side is 2QM² + 2*(16)^2. 16 squared is 256, so 2*256 = 512. Therefore, equation becomes:

2312 = 2QM² + 512

Subtract 512 from both sides:

2312 - 512 = 2QM²

2312 - 500 is 1812, then subtract another 12 gives 1800. So, 1800 = 2QM²

Divide both sides by 2:

QM² = 900

Therefore, QM = sqrt(900) = 30.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
The formula is: For a triangle, the sum of the squares of two sides is equal to twice the square of the median to the third side plus twice the square of the half third side.

So, in symbols: PQ² + QR² = 2QM² + 2PM²

Yes, that's correct. So, plugging in the numbers:

34² + 34² = 2QM² + 2*(16)²
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
If I use Apollonius theorem:

PQ² + QR² = 2QM² + 2PM²

34² + 34² = 2QM² + 2*(16)²

1156 + 1156 = 2QM² + 2*256

2312 = 2QM² + 512

Subtract 512 from both sides:

2312 - 512 = 2QM²

1800 = 2QM²

Divide both sides by 2:

QM² = 900

Therefore, QM = √900 = 30.

Based on execution_2.1:
Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me check again. Maybe I made a calculation error.

Wait, 34 squared is 1156, so two times that is 2312.

<prompt_3.1> Verify the calculations from the equation obtained using Apollonius theorem. </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
Then, 16 squared is 256, times 2 is 512. 2312 minus 512 is indeed 1800. 1800 divided by 2 is 900. Square root is 30.

<execution_4.1>
Let me place the triangle in coordinate system with P at (-16, 0), R at (16, 0), midpoint M at (0,0). Then, vertex Q is at (0, 30) as calculated before. Then, the distance from Q to M is 30 units. So, that's the same result.

Therefore, the length of the median $\overline{QM}$ is $\boxed{30}$.
