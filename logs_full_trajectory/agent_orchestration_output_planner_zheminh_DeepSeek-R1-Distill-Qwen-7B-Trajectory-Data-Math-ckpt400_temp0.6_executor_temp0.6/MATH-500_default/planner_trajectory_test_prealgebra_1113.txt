Okay, let's see. The problem is asking for the positive square root of the product of 10, 15, and 24. So first, I need to calculate the product of these three numbers and then find its square root. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, multiply 10 and 15. That should be straightforward. 10 times 15 is 150. Then, multiply that result by 24. So 150 times 24. Let me compute that. Hmm, 150 times 20 is 3000, and 150 times 4 is 600. Adding those together gives 3000 + 600 = 3600. Wait, so the product of 10, 15, and 24 is 3600. Then, the square root of 3600. What's the square root of 3600?

Based on execution_1.1:
Let me think. I know that 60 squared is 3600 because 60 times 60 is 3600. So the square root of 3600 is 60. Therefore, the answer should be 60.

But wait, maybe I should verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error.

<prompt_2.1> Re-verify the multiplication of 10, 15, and 24, and confirm the square root of 3600. </prompt_2.1>

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this problem by simplifying before multiplying. Let me try that method to cross-check. If I can factor the numbers into their prime factors, maybe I can pair them to form squares.

<prompt_2.2> Simplify the product of 10, 15, and 24 by factoring them into their prime factors and then find the square root. </prompt_2.2>

Alternatively, if I didn't notice that 60^2 is 3600, maybe I can factor 3600 into its prime factors and then pair them. Let's try that.

<prompt_2.3> Factor 3600 into its prime factors and find the square root by pairing the factors. </prompt_2.3>

First, 10 times 15: 10*15. Yes, 10*10 is 100, and then 10*5 is 50, so 100+50=150. That's correct. Then 150 times 24. Let me verify that again. Breaking down 24 into 20 + 4. 150*20: 150*2=300, so 300*10=3000. 150*4=600. Adding 3000 + 600 gives 3600. Yep, that's right. So the product is indeed 3600. Then the square root of 3600. Since 60*60=3600, the square root is 60.

Let's factor each number:

10 can be factored into 2 and 5. 
15 is 3 and 5. 
24 is 2^3 (which is 2*2*2) and 3. 

So combining all these factors: 2, 5, 3, 5, 2, 2, 3. Let me list them all out:

From 10: 2, 5
From 15: 3, 5
From 24: 2, 2, 2, 3

Now, combining all: 2, 5, 3, 5, 2, 2, 2, 3. Let's count them:

Number of 2s: 1 (from 10) + 1 (from 24) + 2 (from 24) = wait, actually, from 10: 1, from 24: 3 (since 24 is 2^3), so total 1 + 3 = 4 twos? Wait, no. Wait, 10 has one 2, 15 has none, 24 has three 2s. So total 1 + 3 = 4 twos. 

Number of 3s: 1 (from 15) + 1 (from 24) = 2 threes. 

Number of 5s: 1 (from 10) + 1 (from 15) = 2 fives. 

So the prime factorization of the product is 2^4 * 3^2 * 5^2. 

Now, to find the square root, we can take half the exponent for each prime factor. So sqrt(2^4 * 3^2 * 5^2) = 2^(4/2) * 3^(2/2) * 5^(2/2) = 2^2 * 3^1 * 5^1 = 4 * 3 * 5 = 4 * 15 = 60. 

So that confirms the previous result. The square root is 60.

<execution_2.3>
Let's factor 3600. Starting with the prime factors:

3600 ÷ 2 = 1800

1800 ÷ 2 = 900

900 ÷ 2 = 450

450 ÷ 2 = 225

225 ÷ 3 = 75

75 ÷ 3 = 25

25 ÷ 5 = 5

5 ÷ 5 = 1

So the prime factors are 2^4 × 3^2 × 5^2. Then, the square root of that would be taking half the exponent for each prime factor. So sqrt(2^4 × 3^2 × 5^2) = 2^(4/2) × 3^(2/2) × 5^(2/2) = 2^2 × 3 × 5 = 4 × 3 × 5 = 60.

Based on execution_2.2:
Wait, let me check if I factored everything correctly. Let's reconfirm.

<prompt_3.1> Verify the prime factorization of 3600 and the calculation of the square root. </prompt_3.1>

Based on execution_2.1, execution_2.2, execution_2.3:
I think that's thorough.
I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. Both methods—direct multiplication then square root, and prime factorization then square root—give the same answer. So I'm confident that the positive square root of the product 10 × 15 × 24 is 60.

**Final Answer**
The positive square root of the product is \boxed{60}.
