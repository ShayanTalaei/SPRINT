Okay, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. So, the question is about a regular hexagon that's divided into six equilateral triangles. Each of these triangles has a perimeter of 21 inches, and we need to find the perimeter of the hexagon. Hmm, alright, let's start breaking this down.

First, I remember that a regular hexagon has all sides equal and all interior angles equal. Also, when they say it's divided into six equilateral triangles, I imagine that each of those triangles has two sides that are sides of the hexagon and one side that's a line connecting two non-adjacent vertices, maybe? Wait, no, actually, if you divide a regular hexagon into triangles by drawing lines from the center to each vertex, then each triangle would have two sides that are radii of the hexagon and one side that's a side of the hexagon.
But since the hexagon is regular, all the radii are equal to the side length of the hexagon. So each of those triangles is equilateral. That makes sense because all sides (two radii and one side of the hexagon) would be equal. So each triangle is equilateral, meaning all three sides are the same length.

Now, the perimeter of one of these triangles is 21 inches. Since all three sides are equal, each side must be 21 divided by 3.
Let me calculate that: 21 รท 3 = 7. So each side of the triangle is 7 inches. But wait, the sides of the triangle are the same as the sides of the hexagon, right? Because the two radii are equal to the side length of the hexagon, and the third side is also a side of the hexagon.
So that means each side of the hexagon is 7 inches. Therefore, the perimeter of the hexagon, which has six sides, would be 6 times 7 inches. Let me do that multiplication: 6 ร 7 = 42. So the perimeter should be 42 inches.

Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.

Wait, let me confirm the structure of the hexagon divided into triangles.

But hold on, maybe there's a different way the hexagon is divided? For example, if you split the hexagon into other shapes first and then triangles? But the problem specifically says it's divided into six equilateral triangles, so the method of drawing lines from the center to each vertex is the correct approach.

Another way to think about it: each triangle has a side that's a side of the hexagon, and the other two sides are radii. Since all sides are equal in an equilateral triangle, the radius must equal the side length of the hexagon. Therefore, each radius is 7 inches, which is the side length of the hexagon. Hence, the perimeter is 6 times 7.

Is there any chance that the perimeter of the triangle includes something else? For example, maybe the perimeter is measured differently?

If you connect the center to all six vertices, you create six equilateral triangles. Each triangle has two sides that are radii and one side that's a side of the hexagon. Since the triangle is equilateral, those two radii must be equal to the side of the hexagon. Therefore, the side length of the hexagon is equal to the radius of the circumscribed circle around the hexagon. So yes, each side of the triangle is indeed equal to the side length of the hexagon.

Therefore, each triangle's side is 7 inches, so the hexagon's side is 7 inches, leading to a perimeter of 6*7=42 inches.

But no, the perimeter of a triangle is just the sum of its three sides. Since all sides are equal and we've established each is 7 inches, the perimeter is indeed 21 inches. So that checks out. Therefore, the side length of the hexagon is 7 inches, leading to a perimeter of 6*7=42 inches.

Based on execution_1.1:
Wait, but let me visualize a regular hexagon. If you draw lines from the center to each vertex, each of those lines is the radius of the circumscribed circle. In a regular hexagon, the radius is equal to the side length.
So the side length of the hexagon is equal to the distance from the center to a vertex. Therefore, each of those triangles has sides equal to the radius, which is the same as the side length of the hexagon. Hence, those triangles are equilateral with sides equal to the hexagon's side.

So, if each triangle's perimeter is 21 inches, each side is 7 inches, so the hexagon's side is 7 inches. Therefore, the perimeter is 6*7=42 inches.

But let me check with another approach.

<prompt_2.1> Explore another approach to verify the perimeter of the hexagon by considering the total number of triangles and their sides. </prompt_2.1>

Alternatively, maybe the problem is a trick question? For example, sometimes with polygons, especially hexagons, there can be different ways to divide them into triangles, but in this case, the problem states it's divided into six equilateral triangles.
So that specific division method must be the one where you draw lines from the center to each vertex, creating six equilateral triangles. Therefore, the side length of each triangle is equal to the side length of the hexagon. Hence, the perimeter is 6*7=42.

Wait, another thought: maybe the perimeter of the triangle is not just three times the side length, but includes something else?
But perimeter is just the sum of all sides. If the triangle is equilateral, all three sides are the same. So if each side is 7 inches, perimeter is 3*7=21, which matches the given. So that's correct.

Therefore, I think the answer is 42 inches.
I don't see any flaws in this reasoning. The key steps are recognizing that the equilateral triangles have sides equal to the hexagon's sides, calculating the side length from the perimeter, then multiplying by six for the hexagon's perimeter.

Suppose the hexagon has side length 's'. Then each of those six triangles has sides of length 's', so they are equilateral. The perimeter of each triangle is 3s. Given that 3s=21, so s=7. Then the perimeter of the hexagon is 6s=6*7=42.

<Final_answer>
Therefore, the perimeter of the regular hexagon is $\boxed{42}$ inches.
