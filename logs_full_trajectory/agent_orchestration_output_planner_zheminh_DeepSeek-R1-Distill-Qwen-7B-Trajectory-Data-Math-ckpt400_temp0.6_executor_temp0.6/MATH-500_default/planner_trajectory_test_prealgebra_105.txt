Okay, so the figure skater starts facing north and spins 2250 degrees to her right. I need to figure out which direction she's facing after that. Let me think step by step.

First, I remember that a full rotation is 360 degrees. So maybe I can figure out how many full rotations she makes and then see the remaining degrees. That should tell me the net effect of her spin.

<prompt_1.1> Calculate the remaining degrees after full rotations using the above plan. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<execution_1.1>
Let me divide 2250 by 360 to see how many full spins that is. Let's do the division: 2250 ÷ 360. Hmm, 360 times 6 is 2160, and 2250 minus 2160 is 90. So that's 6 full rotations plus 90 degrees. So the extra rotation after the full spins is 90 degrees. 

Now, since she's spinning to her right, which direction does that correspond to? If she's facing north and spins right, that's a clockwise rotation. So each quarter turn (90 degrees) to the right would change her direction. Let me recall the directions: North, then east, south, west, and back to north.

Based on execution_1.1:
Wait, no. If you're facing north and turn right (clockwise), your right-hand side is east. So turning 90 degrees right from north would face her east. Then another 90 degrees (180 total) would face south, and another 90 (270) would face west, and 360 would bring her back to north.

But here, the remaining is 90 degrees. So after 6 full rotations (which bring her back to north each time), she spins an additional 90 degrees to her right. So starting from north, turning 90 degrees right would face her east.

Wait, but let me confirm.

<prompt_2.1> Confirm the direction after a 90-degree clockwise turn from north using the above plan. </prompt_2.1>

So the answer should be east?

But wait, maybe I need to check the math again.

<prompt_2.2> Re-evaluate the calculation of 2250 degrees divided by 360 and confirm the remaining degrees using the above plan. </prompt_2.2>

Hmm, but let me think again. Sometimes when dealing with directions and rotations, it's easy to make a mistake with clockwise vs.

<prompt_2.3> Re-evaluate the direction change with 90 degrees of rotation using the above plan. </prompt_2.3>

But let me check another way. Let's think of 2250 degrees as total rotation. Since each 360 is a full turn, we can compute 2250 modulo 360 to find the equivalent angle between 0 and 360.

<prompt_2.4> Use modulo 360 to find the equivalent angle for 2250 degrees and confirm the direction using the above plan. </prompt_2.4>

But wait, let me visualize this. If she starts facing north and spins 2250 degrees to her right, which is clockwise.

<prompt_2.5> Visualize the spin and confirm the final direction using the above plan. </prompt_2.5>

But just to be thorough, let me consider another approach. Let's break down 2250 degrees into multiples of 90 degrees.

<prompt_2.6> Break down 2250 degrees into multiples of 90 degrees and verify the direction using the above plan. </prompt_2.6>
</Plan_2>

<execution_2.1>
Another way: each 90 degrees clockwise turns her direction as follows: North → East → South → West → North, and so on. So starting at North, 1x 90 degrees clockwise is East, 2x is South, 3x is West, 4x brings back to North, etc. So 90 degrees is 1x, which is East. Therefore, after 6 full spins (which don't change her direction) plus 90 degrees clockwise, she faces East.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
2250 divided by 360: 360*6=2160, 2250-2160=90. Yes, that's correct. So 90 degrees clockwise from north is east. So the answer should be east.
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
counterclockwise. Wait, no. If she's spinning to her right, that's clockwise. So a right turn is clockwise. So, starting at north, a 90-degree clockwise turn would face east. Then 180 would be south, 270 west, 360 north again. So 90 degrees is east.
</execution_2.3>

<execution_2.4>
So 2250 divided by 360. Let's compute 360*6=2160. 2250-2160=90. So yes, 2250 degrees is equivalent to 90 degrees clockwise from the starting position. 

Starting at north, turning 90 degrees clockwise (to the right) would face east. So the answer should be east.
</execution_2.4>

<execution_2.5>
Let's compute 2250 divided by 360. Let me do 360*6=2160. 2250-2160=90. So 2250 degrees is equivalent to 6 full rotations plus 90 degrees. Since each full rotation brings her back to the starting direction, the 6 full rotations don't change her direction. Then the remaining 90 degrees clockwise (to her right) from north would be east. So yes, that seems right.
</execution_2.5>

<execution_2.6>
2250 divided by 90 is 25. So 25 times 90 degrees. Each 90 degrees is a quarter turn. So 25 quarter turns clockwise. But maybe that's complicating it. Alternatively, each 90 degrees is a right angle turn. So 2250 divided by 90 is 25. So 25 right-angle turns. But how does that translate to full circles plus some remainder?

Wait, but 25 times 90 is 2250. But 25 divided by 4 is 6 with remainder 1. So 6 full circles (6*4=24 right-angle turns) and 1 remaining right-angle turn. So 6 full circles (which bring her back to north each time) and then 1 right-angle turn, which is 90 degrees. So starting from north, turning 90 degrees right would be east. So same as before.

Based on execution_2.1, execution_2.2, execution_2.3, execution_2.4, execution_2.5, execution_2.6:
But just to visualize again: starting at north, spinning 2250 degrees to the right. Let's think of it as moving clockwise 2250 degrees around a circle.

<prompt_3.1> Finalize the solution and confirm the direction using the above plan. </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
Each 360 is a full circle, so 2250 divided by 360 is 6.25. So 6 full circles and 0.25 of a circle. 0.25 of a circle is 90 degrees. So 0.25 of a circle clockwise from north is east. 

Alternatively, if I imagine a compass, starting at north. Moving 90 degrees clockwise is east, then another 90 is south, another 90 is west, another 90 is north. So every 90 degrees is a quarter turn. 2250 divided by 90 is 25. So 25 quarter turns. 25 divided by 4 is 6 with remainder 1. So 6 full rotations (6*4=24) and 1 quarter turn. So the remainder is 1, meaning 1 quarter turn clockwise from north, which is east. 

Therefore, all methods point to east. So I think the answer is east.

<Final_answer>
Therefore, after spinning $2250^{\circ}$ to her right, the figure skater is facing $\boxed{\text{east}}$.
