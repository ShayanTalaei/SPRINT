Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, Rick is thinking of a positive factor of 14, and Steve is thinking of a positive factor of 42. They both are thinking of the same number. We need to find how many possible numbers they could be thinking of. Hmm, right. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let me recall what a factor is.
A factor of a number is an integer that can be multiplied by another integer to result in the original number. So, for example, factors of 14 are numbers that divide 14 without leaving a remainder.

Let me list out all the positive factors of 14 first. Starting from 1, since 1 is a factor of every number. 14 divided by 1 is 14, so 1 and 14 are factors. Then, 2 divides into 14 seven times, so 2 and 7 are also factors. Let me check if there are any more.

<prompt_1.1> List all the positive factors of 14. </prompt_1.1>

Now, moving on to Steve's number, which is a factor of 42. Let me do the same process. Factors of 42.

<prompt_1.2> List all the positive factors of 42. </prompt_1.2>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
14 is 2 times 7, and both 2 and 7 are primes. So the factors of 14 should be 1, 2, 7, and 14. Let me verify that. 1×14=14, 2×7=14, yes, those are all the pairs. So Rick could be thinking of any of these four numbers: 1, 2, 7, or 14.
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
Starting with 1, 42 divided by 1 is 42, so 1 and 42. Then 2 divides into 42 twenty-one times, so 2 and 21. Next, 3 times 14 is 42, so 3 and 14. Then 6 times 7 is 42, so 6 and 7. Let me check if there are more factors. 4 doesn't divide 42 evenly because 42 divided by 4 is 10.5, which is not an integer. 5 doesn't divide 42 either; 42 divided by 5 is 8.4. So the factors of 42 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42.
</execution_1.2>
</Execution_1>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1, execution_1.2:
Now, the problem states that both Rick and Steve are thinking of the same number. So, that number has to be a common factor of both 14 and 42. Therefore, we need to find the common factors of 14 and 42.

<prompt_2.1> Find the common factors of 14 and 42, and determine how many there are. </prompt_2.1>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Let me list the factors of 14 again: 1, 2, 7, 14. Factors of 42: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42. Now, the intersection of these two sets is the numbers that appear in both lists. Let's see:

1 is in both.
2 is in both.
7 is in both.
14 is in both.
Then, 42, 21, and 6 are only in Steve's factors (42's factors) and not in Rick's. So the common factors are 1, 2, 7, 14. That means there are 4 numbers that could be the one they're both thinking of.
</execution_2.1>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Wait a second, let me confirm. Factors of 14: 1, 2, 7, 14. Factors of 42: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42.

<prompt_3.1> Verify the common factors of 14 and 42 by comparing their factors. </prompt_3.1>
-----

Based on execution_2.1:
But let me make sure I didn't miss any other common factors.

Wait, 14 is a factor of itself, but 14 is also a factor of 42.

<prompt_3.2> Confirm the common factors of 14 and 42 and finalize the count. </prompt_3.2>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
The common ones are indeed 1, 2, 7, 14. So that's four numbers. Therefore, the number of possible numbers they could be thinking of is 4.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
Yes, because 42 is 14 times 3. So 14 is a common factor. Similarly, 7 is a factor of both. 2 and 1 as well. So that's four numbers. So the possible numbers they could be thinking of are 1, 2, 7, and 14. Therefore, 4 possible numbers.
</execution_3.2>
</Execution_3>

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.2:
But hold on, let me think again. The question says "how many possible numbers could they be thinking of"? So, each of these common factors is a possible number that both Rick and Steve could be thinking of. Since Rick has to pick a factor of 14 and Steve a factor of 42, but they both have to pick the same number.
Therefore, the numbers that are common to both sets of factors are the possible numbers. So yes, 1, 2, 7, 14. That's four numbers.

But just to make sure I haven't made a mistake, let me cross-verify. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 14 and 42 is 14, since 14 divides 42. The common factors are all the factors of the GCD. So the factors of 14 are 1, 2, 7, 14, which matches what I found earlier. Therefore, the number of common factors is equal to the number of factors of the GCD, which is 4.

Therefore, the answer should be 4.

**Final Answer**
The number of possible numbers they could be thinking of is \boxed{4}.
