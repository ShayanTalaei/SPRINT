Okay, so I need to find the smallest positive integer n such that all the roots of the equation z⁴ + z² + 1 = 0 are nth roots of unity. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that the nth roots of unity are the solutions to the equation zⁿ = 1. These roots can be expressed using Euler's formula as e²πik/n for k = 0, 1, 2, ...., n-1. So, if all roots of z⁴ + z² + 1 = 0 are nth roots of unity, they must satisfy zⁿ = 1 for some n. The goal is to find the smallest such n.

Let me start by finding the roots of the given quartic equation. The equation is z⁴ + z² + 1 = 0. Maybe I can factor this equation to make it simpler.

Alternatively, another approach is to note that if all roots are roots of unity, then the polynomial z⁴ + z² + 1 must divide zⁿ - 1 for some n. Therefore, the polynomial z⁴ + z² + 1 must be a product of cyclotomic polynomials. Let me recall that the cyclotomic polynomial Φₙ(z) is the minimal polynomial over the integers for primitive nth roots of unity. So, perhaps I can factor z⁴ + z² + 1 into cyclotomic polynomials and find the least common multiple of their orders.

First, let's factor z⁴ + z² + 1. Let me try to factor it.

Let me try to factor it. Maybe it's a quadratic in terms of z². Let me set w = z². Then the equation becomes w² + w + 1 = 0. That's a quadratic equation, which I can solve using the quadratic formula.

<execution_1.2>
Let me check if it factors into quadratics. Suppose z⁴ + z² + 1 = (z² + az + b)(z² + cz + d). Multiplying out, we get z⁴ + (a + c)z³ + (ac + b + d)z² + (ad + bc)z + bd. Comparing coefficients:

1. a + c = 0 (since there's no z³ term)
2. ac + b + d = 1 (coefficient of z²)
3. ad + bc = 0 (coefficient of z)
4. bd = 1 (constant term)

From equation 1, c = -a. From equation 4, bd = 1, so possible options are b = d = 1 or b = d = -1. Let's try b = d = 1 first.

Then equation 3 becomes a*1 + b*(-a) = a - a = 0, which is satisfied. Then equation 2 becomes a*(-a) + 1 + 1 = -a² + 2 = 1. So, -a² + 2 = 1 => a² = 1 => a = 1 or -1. If a = 1, then c = -1. So the factors would be (z² + z + 1)(z² - z + 1). Let's check: (z² + z + 1)(z² - z + 1) = z⁴ - z³ + z² + z³ - z² + z + z² - z + 1 = z⁴ + z² + 1. Perfect, that works. So the quartic factors into (z² + z + 1)(z² - z + 1).

Therefore, the roots of z⁴ + z² + 1 = 0 are the roots of z² + z + 1 = 0 and z² - z + 1 = 0. Let's find the roots of each quadratic.

For z² + z + 1 = 0, the roots are z = [-1 ± √(1 - 4)] / 2 = [-1 ± √(-3)] / 2 = (-1 ± i√3)/2. These are the primitive 3rd roots of unity, right? Because the 3rd roots of unity satisfy z³ = 1, and their minimal polynomial is z² + z + 1. So these roots are primitive 3rd roots, so they are 3rd roots of unity.

For z² - z + 1 = 0, the roots are z = [1 ± √(1 - 4)] / 2 = [1 ± √(-3)] / 2 = (1 ± i√3)/2. Let's check the minimal polynomial here. Let me compute their magnitude: |(1 ± i√3)/2| = √(1/4 + 3/4) = √1 = 1. So they lie on the unit circle. Let's check their order.

Let me compute z³ for one of the roots. Take z = (1 + i√3)/2. Let's compute z²: [(1 + i√3)/2]^2 = (1 + 2i√3 - 3)/4 = (-2 + 2i√3)/4 = (-1 + i√3)/2. Then z³ = z * z² = [(1 + i√3)/2] * [(-1 + i√3)/2] = [(-1)(1) + (1)(i√3) + (-1)(i√3) + (i√3)(i√3)] / 4. Simplify numerator: -1 + i√3 - i√3 + (i²*3) = -1 + 0 + (-3) = -4. So z³ = -4/4 = -1. Then z⁶ = (z³)² = (-1)² = 1. Therefore, z is a primitive 6th root of unity. Because z³ = -1, so the order is 6. Similarly, the other root is the complex conjugate, so also a primitive 6th root of unity.

Therefore, the roots of the original quartic equation are the roots of z² + z + 1 = 0 (which are 3rd roots of unity) and the roots of z² - z + 1 = 0 (which are 6th roots of unity). Therefore, all roots are 6th roots of unity. But wait, are they all 6th roots of unity? Let's check.

The roots from z² + z + 1 are primitive 3rd roots, which are also 6th roots of unity. Because the 6th roots of unity include the primitive 3rd roots (since 3 divides 6). Specifically, e²πi(1/6) = eπi/3, e²πi(3/6) = eπi = -1, e²πi(5/6) = e5πi/3. Wait, the primitive 3rd roots are e²πi(1/3) and e²πi(2/3), which correspond to e4πi/6 and e8πi/6. But e8πi/6 is the same as e2πi(4/6) = e2πi(2/3). Wait, maybe the 6th roots of unity are at angles 0, π/3, 2π/3, π, 4π/3, 5π/3. So the primitive 3rd roots are at 2π/3 and 4π/3, which are 6th roots of unity. So indeed, the primitive 3rd roots are also 6th roots of unity.

Let me compute them. The roots are (-a ± bi)/2. So substituting a² = 1, we have a = 1 or -1. Let's take a = 1.

Based on execution_1.2:
Similarly, the roots from the other quadratic are at angles π/3 and 5π/3, which are also 6th roots of unity. Therefore, all roots are 6th roots of unity. But is 6 the minimal n such that all roots are nth roots of unity? Let's check if a smaller n works.

Then c = -1. So the factors are (z² + z + 1) and (z² - z + 1). Wait, if a = 1, then b = d = 1, so the second factor is z² + (-1)z + 1 = z² - z + 1. Let me check if this works: (z² + z + 1)(z² - z + 1) = z⁴ - z³ + z² + z³ - z² + z + z² - z + 1 = z⁴ + z² + 1. Yes, that's correct. So the original quartic factors into (z² + z + 1)(z² - z + 1).
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
For example, n=3: the roots from the second quadratic (the 6th roots) are not 3rd roots, since their angle is π/3, which is 60 degrees, not 120 or 240. So they are not 3rd roots. Similarly, n=2: roots are on the unit circle, but not at angles that are multiples of π (180 degrees). So n=2 is too small. n=4: roots of unity of order 4 are at angles π/2 and 3π/2. Our roots are at π/3, 2π/3, 4π/3, 5π/3, which are 60, 120, 240, 300 degrees. So not multiples of 90. So n=4 doesn't work. n=5: 5th roots of unity are at angles 72, 144, 216, 288 degrees. Not matching. So n=6 is the first candidate.

Wait, but let me confirm. Let me see if all these roots are indeed 6th roots of unity.

Starting with z² + z + 1 = 0. Using the quadratic formula: z = [-1 ± √(-3)] / 2. These are complex numbers. Similarly, for z² - z + 1 = 0: z = [1 ± √(-3)] / 2. Let me compute their magnitudes. For z = (-1 + i√3)/2, the magnitude is √[(-1/2)² + (√3/2)²] = √[1/4 + 3/4] = √1 = 1. Similarly for all roots, so they lie on the unit circle. Now, let's find their orders. Let's start with the roots of z² + z + 1 = 0.

Let z = (-1 + i√3)/2. Let's compute z³. Let me compute z² first: z² = [(-1 + i√3)/2]^2 = (1 - 2i√3 - 3)/4 = (-2 - 2i√3)/4 = (-1 - i√3)/2. Then z³ = z * z² = [(-1 + i√3)/2] * [(-1 - i√3)/2] = [1 + i√3 - i√3 - (i√3)^2]/4 = [1 - (-3)]/4 = (1 + 3)/4 = 4/4 = 1. So z³ = 1. Therefore, these roots are 3rd roots of unity. But since z ≠ 1, they are primitive 3rd roots.

The 6th roots of unity are e²πik/6 for k=0,1,2,3,4,5. These are 1, eπi/3, e2πi/3, -1, e4πi/3, e5πi/3. The roots of z² + z + 1 are e2πi/3 and e4πi/3, which correspond to k=1 and k=2. The roots of z² - z + 1 are eπi/3 and e5πi/3, which correspond to k=1 and k=5? Wait, no. Wait, eπi/3 is k=1 (since 2π*(1)/6 = π/3). Wait, actually, eπi/3 is the same as e^(2πi*(1)/6) = 6th root of unity at k=1. Similarly, e5πi/3 = e^(2πi*5/6) = 6th root of unity at k=5. So these roots are indeed 6th roots of unity. Therefore, all roots of the original equation are 6th roots of unity.

Based on execution_3.1:
Now, the other quadratic z² - z + 1 = 0. Let's compute its roots. Using the quadratic formula: z = [1 ± √(-3)] / 2. Let's check their orders. Let me take z = (1 + i√3)/2. Let's compute z³. First, z² = [(1 + i√3)/2]^2 = (1 + 2i√3 - 3)/4 = (-2 + 2i√3)/4 = (-1 + i√3)/2. Then z³ = z * z² = [(1 + i√3)/2] * [(-1 + i√3)/2] = [ -1 + i√3 - i√3 + (i√3)^2 ] / 4 = [ -1 + 0 + (-3) ] / 4 = (-4)/4 = -1. So z³ = -1, which implies z⁶ = 1. Therefore, these roots are 6th roots of unity.

But is 6 the minimal such n? Let's check if all roots are 6th roots of unity and no smaller n works.

<execution_5.1>
For example, n=3: The roots from the second quadratic are not 3rd roots, since their angle is π/3, which is not a multiple of 2π/3. Similarly, n=6 is the least common multiple of 3 and 6, which is 6. Therefore, the minimal n is 6.

<Plan_6>
Based on execution_5.1:
Wait, but let me check if the roots satisfy z⁶ = 1. Take z = (1 + i√3)/2. Let's compute z⁶. Since z³ = -1, then z⁶ = (z³)² = (-1)² = 1. Similarly, for z = (-1 + i√3)/2, which is a primitive 3rd root, z³ = 1, so z⁶ = 1 as well. Therefore, all roots satisfy z⁶ = 1. Moreover, since some roots have order 3 and others have order 6, the minimal n such that all roots are nth roots of unity is the least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 6, which is 6. Therefore, n=6 is the minimal positive integer satisfying the condition.

Wait, but let me confirm once more. Suppose there exists a smaller n, say n=6 is the LCM, but maybe a smaller n, like n=3 or n=2 or n=4 or n=5. Let's check n=6 is minimal.

<prompt_6.1> Confirm that 6 is the minimal n such that all roots are nth roots of unity. </prompt_6.1>

<execution_6.1>
For n=3: The roots of the second quadratic are 6th roots, but not 3rd roots. For example, z = (1 + i√3)/2 is a 6th root, but z³ = -1 ≠ 1. So they are not 3rd roots. Hence, n=3 is too small. Similarly, n=6 is the first n where all roots satisfy zⁿ = 1.
