<Question>
Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.
</Question>

<think>
<Plan_1>
Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this game where they take turns removing 1 or 4 tokens from a stack of n tokens. Alice goes first, and the person who takes the last token wins. We need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 make it possible for Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Let me start by understanding the game mechanics. It's a two-player game with alternating turns. Each turn, a player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens. The key here is to figure out for which values of n Bob can force a win, regardless of Alice's moves. This sounds like a classic combinatorial game problem, maybe similar to Nim or other impartial games.

First, I should recall that in such games, positions can often be classified as either "winning" or "losing" positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. A losing position is the opposite: no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win. So, if we can classify the positions from 1 to 2024 as winning or losing, we can count how many are losing positions (since those would be the n where Bob can win if Alice starts).

Let me try to analyze the game step by step.

Let's start with small values of n and see if we can find a pattern.

<prompt_1.1> Analyze the game for small values of n from 0 to 14 to determine which positions are winning or losing. </prompt_1.1>
-----

But let me check with another example. Let's take n=5.

<prompt_1.2> Use the recursive formula to determine if n=5 is a winning or losing position. </prompt_1.2>

Similarly, n=6:

<prompt_1.3> Analyze the recursive formula for n=6 to determine if it is a winning or losing position. </prompt_1.3>

n=7:

<prompt_1.4> Analyze the recursive formula for n=7 to determine if it is a winning or losing position. </prompt_1.4>

n=8:

<prompt_1.5> Analyze the recursive formula for n=8 to determine if it is a winning or losing position. </prompt_1.5>

n=9:

<prompt_1.6> Analyze the recursive formula for n=9 to determine if it is a winning or losing position. </prompt_1.6>

n=10:

<prompt_1.7> Analyze the recursive formula for n=10 to determine if it is a winning or losing position. </prompt_1.7>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
Starting with n=0: If there are 0 tokens, the game is already over. But since players take turns removing tokens, n=0 might be considered a losing position because the player whose turn it is cannot make a move. However, in this problem, n is a positive integer, so maybe we don't have to worry about n=0. Let's check.

Wait, the problem says "positive integers n less than or equal to 2024". So n starts at 1. So we need to analyze from n=1 upwards.

For n=1: Alice can take 1 token and win. So n=1 is a winning position for Alice.

For n=2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 token for Bob. Then Bob can take 1111 last 1 token and win. Alternatively, if Alice takes 1 token, Bob can take the last one. Wait, so if Alice takes 1 from 2, Bob takes 1 and wins. So Bob can win here. Wait, but if Alice takes 4 tokens, she can't, since there are only 2. So Alice's only move is to take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who then takes it and wins. Therefore, n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win. So n=2 is a losing position (Bob can win if Alice starts).

Wait, but that seems contradictory. Let me think again. If Alice is at n=2, she can only take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who then takes it and wins. So Bob can win. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can force a win. So n=2 is a losing position.

Similarly, n=3: Alice can take 1, leaving 2 for Bob. Then Bob is in a losing position (from n=2), so Bob can't win. Wait, no. Wait, in n=2, Bob can win. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me clarify.

Wait, positions are defined as winning or losing depending on whether the current player can force a win. So if a position is winning, the current player can force a win; if it's losing, the current player cannot force a win.

So let's define:

- A position n is a winning position if the current player can move to a losing position for the opponent.

- A position n is a losing position if every possible move leads to a winning position for the opponent.

So starting from n=0: Since there are no tokens to take, the player to move loses. So n=0 is a losing position.

Now, n=1: The current player can take 1 token and win. So n=1 is a winning position.

n=2: The current player can take 1 token, leaving n=1, which is a winning position for the opponent. Alternatively, can they take 4 tokens? No, since n=2. So only move is to take 1, leaving n=1. Since the opponent is in a winning position, n=2 is a losing position.

n=3: Current player can take 1 token, leaving n=2 (which is a losing position for the opponent). So n=3 is a winning position.

n=4: Current player can take 1 or 4 tokens. Taking 1 token leaves n=3 (winning for opponent). Taking 4 tokens leaves n=0 (losing for opponent). So the current player can take 4 tokens and win. Therefore, n=4 is a winning position.

n=5: Current player can take 1 token, leaving n=4 (winning for opponent). Or take 4 tokens, leaving n=1 (winning for opponent). So both moves leave the opponent in a winning position. Therefore, n=5 is a losing position.
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
If Alice takes 1 token, leaving 4 for Bob. Then Bob can take all 4 and win. If Alice takes 4 tokens, she wins immediately. Wait, so if n=5, Alice can just take 4 tokens and win. So n=5 is a winning position for Alice. Therefore, Bob cannot win here. So n=5 is a winning position for Alice, so Bob cannot force a win. So n=5 is not a losing position.
</execution_1.2>

<execution_1.3>
n=5: If Alice takes 1, leaving 4 for Bob. Then Bob can take 4 and win. If Alice takes 4, leaving 1 for Bob. Bob takes 1 and wins. So n=5 is a losing position for Alice, so Bob can win. Wait, but wait, n=5 is a losing position here, but n=5 is less than 8. Wait, but according to our previous analysis, positions 5, 6, 7, 8 are losing. Wait, but let's check n=5 again.

Wait, n=5: If Alice takes 1, leaving 4 for Bob. Then Bob can take 4 and win. If Alice takes 4, leaving 1 for Bob. Bob takes 1 and wins. So Bob wins. So n current player can take 1 or 4. So if the current player can take the entire stack, they win. So for n=5, if Alice takes 1, Bob takes 4 and wins. If Alice takes 4, Bob takes 1 and wins. So n=5 is a losing position for Alice, so Bob can win. So n=5 is losing. Similarly, n=6: Alice can take 1, leaving 5 (which is losing for Bob, so Bob would lose if Alice takes 1). Wait, no. Wait, if n=5 is losing for the player who has to move, then if Alice takes 1, leaving n=5 for Bob, Bob is in a losing position, so Bob would lose. Wait, no, hold on. Wait, maybe I messed up the direction.

Wait, let's clarify: If a position is losing, it means that the player whose turn it is cannot force a win, assuming the opponent plays optimally. So if n=5 is a losing position, then if Alice is faced with n=5, she cannot force a win. But in the case of n=5, when Alice takes 1, leaving 4 for Bob. Then Bob can take 4 and win. If Alice takes 4, leaving 1 for Bob. Bob takes 1 and wins. So in both cases, Bob can win. Therefore, n=5 is a losing position for Alice, so Bob can win. So n=5 is a losing position. Similarly, n=6: Alice can take 1, leaving 5 for Bob, which is a losing position for Bob (since Bob would be in a losing position as per n=5 analysis). Wait, but if Bob is faced with n=5, he can win. Wait, this is confusing. Let me re-examine.

Wait, maybe I need to correct my earlier analysis. Let's start over with a table.
</execution_1.3>

<execution_1.4>
For n=7, Alice can take 4 tokens, leaving 3 for Bob. But Bob can take 1 token, leaving 2 for Alice. Alice takes 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who takes it and wins. So Bob can win. Wait, but if Alice takes 4 from 7, leaving 3, then Bob can take 1, leaving 2. Then Alice takes 1, leaving 1. Then Bob takes the last one. So Bob wins. Therefore, n=7 is a losing position for Alice (i.e., a winning position for Bob). Wait, but according to the recursive formula, f(7) = f(6) OR f(3). If f(6) is True and f(3) is False, then f(7 problem is in Chinese, \boxed{1005} 。
</execution_1.4>

<execution_1.5>
Player 1 can take 1 token, leaving 7 for Player 2. From our previous analysis, n=7 is a losing position, so Player 2 would lose. Wait, that can't be. Wait, n=7 is a losing position, so if Player 1 takes 1 from 8, leaving 7 (a losing position), then Player 2 is in a losing position. Therefore, Player 1 can win by taking 1.

Alternatively, Player 1 could take 4 tokens from 8, leaving 4. Then Player 2 can take 4 tokens and win. So Player 1 would not choose that. So taking 1 is better. Therefore, n=8 is a winning position.
</execution_1.5>

<execution_1.6>
n=9: Bob can take 1, leaving 8 for Alice. From above, 8 is a losing position, so Alice is in a losing position. So Bob wins.
</execution_1.6>

<execution_1.7>
n= 11 n.  = 1 + 4 = 5. So, Bob can take 1 token, leaving 4 for Alice. Then Alice can take 4 and win. Alternatively, if Bob takes 4 tokens, leaving 6 for Alice. Then Alice can take 1 token, leaving 5. Then Bob can take 1 token, leaving 4, Alice takes 4 and wins. Wait, so maybe Bob can't force a win here either? Wait, but according to the pattern, since 10 ≡ 1 mod 5, which is a losing position, so Bob can force a win. But in my analysis, it seems Alice can win. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.

Wait, n=10: Bob's options are to take 1 or 4. If he takes 1, leaving 9. Then Alice can take 1, leaving 8. Then Bob can take 4, leaving 4. Alice takes 4 and wins. If Bob takes 4, leaving 6. Alice can take 1, leaving 5. Bob takes 1, leaving 4. Alice takes 4 and wins. So in both cases, Alice can win. Wait, so maybe my initial pattern was wrong? But according to the mod 5, 10 is 0 mod 5, which is a losing position. But according to this analysis, Bob can't win. Hmm, maybe my initial assumption was wrong. Wait, maybe I need to re-examine the pattern.

Wait, let's list out the positions from 1 to 10:

n=1: winning (take 1)
n=2: winning (take 1, leave 1)
n=3: winning (take 1, leave 2)
n=4: winning (take 4)
n=5: losing (taking 1 leaves 4, which is winning for Alice; taking 4 leaves 1, which is winning for Alice)
n=6: winning (take 1, leave 5 which is losing for Alice)
n=7: winning (take 4, leave 3)
n=8: winning (take 1, leave 7)
n=9: winning (take 1, leave 8)
n=10: losing (take 1 leaves 9, which is winning; take 4 leaves 6, which is winning)
</execution_1.7>
</Execution_1>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Wait, but n=2: Alice takes 1, leaving 1 for Bob. Bob takes the last 1 and wins. So Bob can win. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can force a win.
-----

Based on execution_1.2:
Wait, n=5: If Alice takes 1, leaving 4 for Bob. Then Bob can take 4 and win.
If Alice takes 4, leaving 1 for Bob. Bob takes 1 and wins.
So Bob can win here. So n=5 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can force a win.
-----

Based on execution_1.3:
n=3: current player takes 1, leaving 2 (losing for opponent). So n=3 is winning.
n=4: current player takes 4 and wins. So n=4 is winning.
n=5: current player can take 1 (leaving 4, which is winning for opponent) or take 4 (leaving 1, which is winning for opponent). So n=5 is losing.
n=6: current player can take 1 (leaving 5, which is losing for opponent) or take 4 (leaving 2, which is losing for opponent). Wait, hold on.

<prompt_2.1> Analyze positions 6 to 10 using the recursive formula and determine if they are winning or losing positions. </prompt_2.1>
-----

Based on execution_1.7:
So maybe the pattern is that every 5 numbers, starting from n=5, the losing positions are n=5, 10, 15, etc.?
So the losing positions are n ≡ 0 mod 5, except n=5? Wait, n=5 is losing, n=10 is losing, n=15 is losing, etc.

<prompt_2.2> Identify the losing positions and verify the pattern for n=10 and n=11. </prompt_2.2>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Wait, n=2 is losing. So if n=6, current player can take 1 (leaving 5, which is losing for opponent) or take 4 (leaving 2, which is losing for opponent). Therefore, n=6 is a winning position. Because the current player can move to a losing position for the opponent. So n=6 is winning.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Let me check n=11. If n=11, Alice can take 1, leaving 10 (losing for Bob), so Bob is in a losing position. Therefore, n=11 is a winning position. So the losing positions are n=5, 10, 15, etc. So every multiple of 5 minus 0? Wait, 5,10,15,... So n=5k where k is a positive integer. But wait, n=15: Let's check. If n=15, Alice can take 1, leaving 14. Then Bob can take 1, leaving 13. Alice can take 4, leaving 9. Bob can take 1, leaving 8. Alice can take 4, leaving 4. Bob takes 4 and wins. Wait, but according to the pattern, n=15 should be a losing position. Hmm, maybe my initial pattern is wrong. Alternatively, maybe the losing positions are n ≡ 0 mod 5. Let's check n=5: losing, n=10: losing, n=15: losing. But in the case of n=15, if Alice takes 1, leaving 14. Then Bob can take 4, leaving 10. Then Alice is in a losing position. Wait, so Bob can take 4 from 14, leaving 10, which is a losing position for Alice. Therefore, Bob can win. So n=15 is a losing position. So maybe the losing positions are n=5,10,15,..., multiples of 5. Then n=2024 divided by 5 gives 404.8, so the number of multiples of 5 less than or equal to 2024 is floor(2024/5) = 404. So the answer would be 404. But wait, let me check with n=15 again.
</execution_2.2>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
So n=6 is a winning position.

n=7: Alice can take 1, leaving 6 (winning for Bob). Or take 4, leaving 3. If Alice takes 4, leaving 3, Bob can take 1, leaving 2 for Alice. Alice takes 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who takes it and wins. Wait, so if Alice takes 4, leaving 3, Bob can take 1, forcing Alice into a losing position.

<prompt_3.1> Analyze the winning and losing positions for n=1 to n=10 and identify the pattern. </prompt_3.1>
-----

Based on execution_2.2:
But wait, n=15: If Alice takes 1, leaving 14. Bob can take 4, leaving 10 (which is a losing position). Then Alice is in a losing position. If Alice takes 4, leaving 11. Bob can take 1, leaving 10 (losing for Alice). So Bob can win. Therefore, n=15 is a losing position. Similarly, n=20: Alice takes 1, leaving 19. Bob takes 4, leaving 15 (losing for Alice). So Bob can win. So n=20 is a losing position. Therefore, the losing positions are multiples of 5.

<prompt_3.2> Verify the losing positions and conclude the number of losing positions up to 2024. </prompt_3.2>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
So Bob can win. Alternatively, if Alice takes 1, leaving 6 (winning for Bob). So Bob can win. Therefore, n=7 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win. Wait, but according to the recursive formula, f(n) = f(n-1) OR f(n-4). So f(7) = f(6) OR f(3). If f(6) is True and f(3) is False, then f(7) is True. But according to our analysis, n=7 is a losing position. There's a contradiction here. So perhaps my recursive formula is incorrect.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
So the losing positions are n=5,10,15,...., up to 2020 (since 2025 is 5*405, which is over 2024). So the number of losing positions is floor(2024/5) = 404. Because 5*404=2020, which is ≤2024, and 5*405=2025>2024. Therefore, the number of losing positions is 404. Therefore, the answer is 404.
</execution_3.2>
</Execution_3>

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
Wait, maybe the formula is not f(n) = f(n-1) OR f(n-4). Let me think again. The current player can choose to take 1 or 4 tokens.

<prompt_4.1> Re-evaluate the recursive formula and analyze the winning and losing positions for n=1 to n=10. </prompt_4.1>

Based on execution_3.2:
Wait, but wait, let's check n=15.

</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
If taking 1 token, the next position is n-1. If taking 4 tokens, the next position is n-4. The current player wins if at least one of the next positions is a losing position for the opponent. So f(n) = f(n-1) OR f(n-4). Wait, no. Wait, if the current player can move to a losing position for the opponent, then f(n) is True. So f(n) = (f(n-1) is False OR f(n-4) is False). Because the current player can choose to take 1 or 4 tokens. If either of those moves leaves the opponent in a losing position, then the current player can win. Therefore, f(n) = (not f(n-1)) OR (not f(n-4)).

Wait, but in logic terms, if either of the options leads to a losing position for the opponent, then the current position is a winning position. So f(n) = (f(n-1) is False) OR (f(n-4) is False). So f(n) = not (f(n-1) AND f(n-4)). Wait, no. Wait, OR, because if either move leads to a losing position for the opponent, then the current position is a winning position. So f(n) = (not f(n-1)) OR (not f(n-4)).
</execution_4.1>

<execution_4.2>
If Alice is faced with 15 tokens, she can take 1 or 4. If she takes 1, leaving 14. Then Bob can take 4, leaving 10 (which is a losing position). If she takes 4, leaving 11. Bob can take 1, leaving 10. So in both cases, Bob can force Alice into a losing position. So n=15 is a losing position. Similarly, n=20: Alice takes 1, leaving 19. Bob takes 4, leaving 15. Alice is in a losing position. So yes, the pattern holds.

Therefore, the losing positions are multiples of 5. Therefore, to find the number of n ≤2024 where Bob can force a win, we need to count the number of multiples of 5 from 5 to 2020 (since 2020=5*404). So the number of such n is 404.

</Execution_4>

<Plan_5>
Based on execution_4.1:
Let me start over with the correct recursive formula.

<prompt_5.1> Recalculate the positions from 1 to 10 using the correct recursive formula and confirm the losing positions. </prompt_5.1>
</Plan_5>

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
Let's recompute:

n=0: losing (base case)

n=1: can take 1 to reach 0 (losing). So f(1) = True (winning)

n=2: can take 1 to reach 1 (winning). So f(2) = True

n=3: can take 1 to reach 2 (winning). So f(3) = True

n=4: can take 4 to reach 0 (losing). So f(4) = True

n=5: can take 1 to reach 4 (winning) or take 4 to reach 1 (winning). So f(5) = False

n=6: can take 1 to reach 5 (losing) or take 4 to reach 2 (winning). So f(6) = True

n=7: can take 1 to reach 6 (winning) or take 4 to reach 3 (winning). So f(7) = False

n=8: can take 1 to reach 7 (losing) or take 4 to reach 4 (winning). So f(8) = True

n=9: can take 1 to reach 8 (winning) or take 4 to reach 5 (losing). So f(9) = True

n=10: can take 1 to reach 9 (winning) or take 4 to reach 6 (winning). So f(10) = False

n=11: can take 1 to reach 10 (losing) or take 4 to reach 7 (losing). So f(11) = True

n=12: can take 1 to reach 11 (winning) or take 4 to reach 8 (winning). So f(12) = False

n=13: can take 1 to reach 12 (losing) or take 4 to reach 9 (winning). So f(13) = True

n=14: can take 1 to reach 13 (winning) or take 4 to reach 10 (losing). So f(14) = True

n=15: can take 1 to reach 14 (winning) or take 4 to reach 11 (winning). So f(15) = False

Wait, so the losing positions (where f(n)=False) are n=5,7,10,12,15,... Let's list them:

n=5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,.... Hmm, this seems to follow a pattern of losing positions at n=5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,.... It seems like every 5 numbers, starting at 5, with two consecutive losses, then skipping one, etc. Wait, maybe the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod 5? Let's check:

n=5: 5 mod 5 = 0 → losing
n=7: 7 mod 5 = 2 → losing
n=10: 10 mod 5 = 0 → losing
n=12: 12 mod 5 = 2 → losing
n=15: 15 mod 5 = 0 → losing
n=17: 17 mod 5 = 2 → losing
n=20: 20 mod 5 = 0 → losing
n=22: 22 mod 5 = 2 → losing

Yes! So the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5. Therefore, the losing positions are n ≡ 0 or 2 mod 5. So for n from 1 to 2024, we need to count how many numbers are congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5.
</execution_5.1>
</Execution_5>

<Plan_6>
Based on execution_5.1:
For example, n=5 is 0 mod 5, n=7 is 2 mod 5, n=10 is 0 mod 5, n=12 is 2 mod 5, etc.

<prompt_6.1> Summarize the losing positions and calculate the number of positive integers n ≤ 2024 that are losing positions. </prompt_6.1>
</Plan_6>

<Execution_6>
<execution_6.1>
So the losing positions are those where n mod 5 is 0 or 2. Therefore, the number of losing positions up to 2024 is the number of integers from 1 to 2024 that are congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5.

To compute this, we can calculate the number of numbers congruent to 0 mod 5 and the number congruent to 2 mod 5, then sum them.

Numbers congruent to 0 mod 5 between 1 and 2024: The first such number is 5, then 10, 15,..., up to the largest number ≤2024. The largest multiple of 5 ≤2024 is 2020 (since 2024 ÷5 = 404.8, so 404*5=2020). The count is 404 numbers (from 5*1 to 5*404).

Numbers congruent to 2 mod 5 between 1 and 2024: The first such number is 2, then 7, 12,..., up to the largest number ≤2024. The sequence is 2 +5k, where k ≥0. The largest such number ≤2024 is 2022 (since 2022 = 2 +5*404). The count is 405 numbers (from 5*0 +2 to 5*404 +2).

Therefore, total losing positions: 404 + 405 = 809. Therefore, Bob can force a win for 809 values of n ≤2024.

Wait, but let me verify this with another approach.

<prompt_7.1> Verify the count of losing positions using an alternative method and confirm the final answer. </prompt_7.1>

<Execution_7>
<execution_7.1>
The number of numbers congruent to 0 mod 5 up to N is floor(N/5). For N=2024, floor(2024/5)=404.

The number of numbers congruent to 2 mod 5 up to N is floor((N -2)/5) +1. For N=2024, (2024 -2)/5=2022/5=404.4, floor(404.4)=404, then +1=405. So total 404 +405=809. So yes, 809 numbers.

Therefore, the answer is 809.

But let me check with smaller N to see if the formula holds.

<prompt_8.1> Verify the count of losing positions with smaller values of N to ensure the formula is accurate. </prompt_8.1>

For example, N=5:

Numbers congruent to 0 mod5: 5 → count 1

Numbers congruent to 2 mod5: 2 → count 1

Total 2, but in reality, n=5 is losing, n=2 is losing. So count is 2, which matches.

For N=7:

Numbers congruent to 0 mod5: 5 → count 1

Numbers congruent to 2 mod5: 2,7 → count 2

Total 3. Let's list them: 2,5,7. Yes, three numbers. So formula works.

For N=10:

Numbers congruent to 0 mod5: 5,10 → count 2

Numbers congruent to 2 mod5: 2,7 → count 2

Total 4. Let's list them: 2,5,7,10. Correct.

So the formula seems accurate. Therefore, for N=2024, the answer is 809.

2,5,7,10,12,15 → 6 numbers. So yes, 6 numbers. According to the formula:

Numbers congruent to 0 mod5 up to 15: 5,10,15 → 3 numbers

Numbers congruent to 2 mod5 up to 15: 2,7,12 → 3 numbers

Total 6, which matches. So the formula works.

Therefore, the answer is 809. So the number of positive integers n ≤2024 where Bob can force a win is 809.

<execution_10.1>
Numbers congruent to 0 mod5: 5,10,15,20 → 4 numbers

Numbers congruent to 2 mod5: 2,7,12,17 → 4 numbers

Total 8 numbers: 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20. Let's check if these are losing positions.

For n=20: Alice takes 1, leaving 19. Bob takes 4, leaving 15. Alice is in a losing position. If Alice takes 4, leaving 16. Bob takes 1, leaving 15. Alice is in a losing position. So yes, n=20 is losing. So the formula holds.

Therefore, the total number of losing positions up to 2024 is 809. Therefore, the answer is 809.

<Plan_11>
Based on execution_10.1:
I think that's solid. The losing positions are those where n ≡0 or 2 mod5, and the count is 809.
Therefore, the answer is \boxed{809}.
