Okay, so I need to find the remainder when the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\) is divided by 1000, where \(\omega\) is a 13th root of unity not equal to 1. Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem step by step.

<prompt_1.1> Read the problem statement carefully and identify the goal. Then, analyze the product expression \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\) and think about possible strategies to simplify it. </prompt_1.1>

First, roots of unity. Since \(\omega\) is a 13th root of unity, it satisfies \(\omega^{13} = 1\). The roots are \(\omega^k\) for \(k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 12\). The expression given is a product over all these roots except \(\omega^0 = 1\), but wait, the product is from \(k=0\) to \(12\), so it includes \(\omega^0 = 1\). But the problem states \(\omega \neq 1\), so maybe the product is over all 13th roots of unity, including 1? Wait, but the problem says "Let \(\omega \neq 1\) be a 13th root of unity", so maybe we need to compute the product for a specific \(\omega\) (not equal to 1) and then find the remainder when that product is divided by 1000? But the product is over all 13th roots of unity, including 1? Wait, the product is written as \(\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\), which is the product over all 13th roots of unity, since \(\omega^k\) for \(k=0\) to \(12\) gives all 13th roots. But since \(\omega\) is a primitive 13th root of unity (assuming that's the case), then the product would be over all roots. Wait, but the problem says "Let \(\omega \neq 1\) be a 13th root of unity". So maybe the product is over all 13th roots, including 1? But then the product would be the product of all factors (2 - 2\(\omega^k\) + \(\omega^{2k}\)) for each k from 0 to 12. But if \(\omega\) is a primitive 13th root, then the product would be the same regardless of which primitive root we choose, due to symmetry.

Based on execution_1.1:
So maybe we can compute this product by considering the polynomial whose roots are these expressions, or perhaps using properties of cyclotomic polynomials.

<prompt_2.1> Plan to simplify the expression \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\) by recognizing it as a product over all 13th roots of unity of a quadratic expression in \(\omega^k\). Consider factoring the quadratic or other polynomial properties to simplify the product. </prompt_2.1>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Alternatively, note that \(\omega^{2k}\) can be written as \((\omega^2)^k\), so maybe we can let \(\alpha = \omega^2\), but since \(\omega\) is a primitive 13th root, \(\alpha\) would be a primitive 13th root as well, because 2 and 13 are coprime. Wait, 13 is prime, so 2 has an inverse modulo 13. Therefore, \(\alpha\) is also a primitive 13th root of unity. Hmm, but maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, let's look at the expression inside the product: \(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}\). Let's denote this as \(P_k = 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}\). Maybe we can factor this quadratic expression in \(\omega^k\). Let's see:

\(P_k = \omega^{2k} - 2\omega^k + 2\). Hmm, quadratic in \(\omega^k\). Let's check if this can be factored. The discriminant is \(4 - 8 = -4\), so the roots would be \(\omega^k = [2 \pm \sqrt{-4}]/2 = 1 \pm i\). So, \(P_k = (\omega^k - (1 + i))( \omega^k - (1 - i))\). Therefore, the product becomes \(\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - (1 + i))( \omega^k - (1 - i))\). Which is the same as \(\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - (1 + i)) \times \prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - (1 - i))\).

So, the original product is the product over all 13th roots of unity of \((\omega^k - a)(\omega^k - b)\), where \(a = 1 + i\) and \(b = 1 - i\). Now, the product over all roots of unity \(\omega^k - z\) is equal to the cyclotomic polynomial evaluated at z, but actually, more precisely, the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} (x - \omega^k) = x^n - 1\). Wait, so if we set \(x = a\), then \(\prod_{k=0}^{12} (a - \omega^k) = a^{13} - 1\). Similarly, \(\prod_{k=0}^{12} (b - \omega^k) = b^{13} - 1\). Therefore, the original product is \((a^{13} - 1)(b^{13} - 1)\), where \(a = 1 + i\) and \(b = 1 - i\).

Therefore, the product simplifies to \(( (1 + i)^{13} - 1 ) ( (1 - i)^{13} - 1 )\). So, now we need to compute \((1 + i)^{13}\) and \((1 - i)^{13}\), subtract 1 from each, multiply them together, then take the result modulo 1000.

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
First, let's compute \((1 + i)^{13}\). To compute powers of complex numbers, it's often easier to convert them to polar form. Let's write \(1 + i\) in polar form.

The modulus of \(1 + i\) is \(\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{2}\), and the argument is \(\pi/4\) radians. Therefore, \(1 + i = \sqrt{2} \left( \cos \frac{\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{4} \right)\). Raising this to the 13th power:

\[
(1 + i)^{13} = \left( \sqrt{2} \right)^{13} \left( \cos \frac{13\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{13\pi}{4} \right)

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_2.1, execution_3:
First, compute modulus and argument:

The modulus is \((\sqrt{2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^{6} \times 2^{1/2} = 64 \sqrt{2}\).

The argument is \(13 \times \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{13\pi}{4}\). To simplify this, subtract multiples of \(2\pi\):

\(\frac{13\pi}{4} - 2\pi \times 1 = \frac{13\pi}{4} - \frac{8\pi}{4} = \frac{5\pi}{4}\).

So, \((1 + i)^{13} = 64 \sqrt{2} \left( \cos \frac{5\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{5\pi}{4} \right)\).

Similarly, \(1 - i\) has modulus \(\sqrt{2}\) and argument \(-\frac{\pi}{4}\). Raising to the 13th power:

\[
(1 - i)^{13} = \left( \sqrt{2} \right)^{13} \left( \cos \left( -\frac{13\pi}{4} \right) + i \sin \left( -\frac{13\pi}{4} \right) \right)

So, \((1 + i)^{13} = 64 \sqrt{2} \left( \cos \frac{5\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{5\pi}{4} \right)\). The angle \(\frac{5\pi}{4}\) is in the third quadrant, so cosine and sine are both negative:

Wait, let's compute it step by step:

First, compute \(64 \sqrt{2} \times (-\sqrt{2}/2)\):

\(64 \times \sqrt{2} \times (-\sqrt{2}/2) = 64 \times (-2/2) = 64 \times (-1) = -64\).

Therefore, \((1 + i)^{13} = -64(1 + i)\). Similarly, let's compute \((1 - i)^{13}\).

First, \((1 - i)^{13}\) in polar form:

\(1 - i\) has modulus \(\sqrt{2}\), argument \(-\pi/4\). Raising to the 13th power:

\[
(1 - i)^{13} = \left( \sqrt{2} \right)^{13} \left( \cos \left( -\frac{13\pi}{4} \right) + i \sin \left( -\frac{13\pi}{4} \right) \right)

<Plan_9>
Based on execution_2.1, execution_3, execution_4, execution_5, execution_6, execution_7, execution_8:
Similarly, compute the angle:

\(-\frac{13\pi}{4}\). Adding \(2\pi\) once:

\(-\frac{13\pi}{4} + 2\pi = -\frac{13\pi}{4} + \frac{8\pi}{4} = -\frac{5\pi}{4}\). Adding another \(2\pi\):

\(-\frac{5\pi}{4} + 2\pi = \frac{3\pi}{4}\). So, the angle is equivalent to \( \frac{3\pi}{4} \). But since angles are periodic, so \(-\frac{13\pi}{4} \equiv \frac{3\pi}{4} \mod 2\pi\). Wait, but let me check:

Alternatively, compute \(-\frac{13\pi}{4}\) divided by \(2\pi\):

\(-\frac{13}{4} \times \pi / (2\pi) = -13/8\). So, the integer part is -2, so add 2 to get the positive equivalent angle:

\(-\frac{13\pi}{4} + 2\pi \times 2 = -\frac{13\pi}{4} + \frac{16\pi}{4} = \frac{3\pi}{4}\). So, yes, the angle is \(\frac{3\pi}{4}\). Therefore:

\[
(1 - i)^{13} = 64 \sqrt{2} \left( \cos \frac{3\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{3\pi}{4} \right)

Similarly, \(\cos \frac{3\pi}{4} = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\), \(\sin \frac{3\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\). Therefore:

\[
(1 - i)^{13} = 64 \sqrt{2} \left( -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = 64 \sqrt{2} \times \left( -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) (1 - i) = -64 (1 - i)

<Plan_11>
Based on execution_2.1, execution_3, execution_4, execution_5, execution_6, execution_7, execution_8, execution_9, execution_10:
Therefore, \((1 + i)^{13} = -64(1 + i)\) and \((1 - i)^{13} = -64(1 - i)\). Therefore, substituting back into the original expression:

\(( (1 + i)^{13} - 1 ) ( (1 - i)^{13} - 1 ) = ( -64(1 + i) - 1 ) ( -64(1 - i) - 1 ) \).

Let's compute each term:

First term: \(-64(1 + i) - 1 = -64 - 64i - 1 = -65 - 64i\).

Second term: \(-64(1 - i) - 1 = -64 + 64i - 1 = -65 + 64i\).

So, the product becomes \((-65 - 64i)(-65 + 64i)\). This is a product of a complex number and its conjugate, which equals the square of the modulus.

<prompt_11.1> Calculate the product \((-65 - 64i)(-65 + 64i)\) by expanding and simplifying, then find its modulus squared. </prompt_11.1>
</Plan_11>

<Execution_11>
<execution_11.1>
Compute modulus squared:

\((-65)^2 + (-64)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321\). Therefore, the product is 8321.

Wait, but let me verify:

Alternatively, compute the product:

\((-65 - 64i)(-65 + 64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096)(i^2) = 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321. Yes, same result.

So, the original product is 8321. Therefore, we need to find 8321 mod 1000. Since 8321 divided by 1000 is 8*1000 = 8000, remainder 321. Therefore, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.
</execution_11.1>
</Execution_11>

<Plan_12>
Based on execution_11.1:
Wait, but hold on. Let me check if I made a mistake here. Because the original product is over all 13th roots of unity, including 1, but the problem states "Let \(\omega \neq 1\) be a 13th root of unity". So, does the product include \(\omega^0 = 1\)?
But in the problem statement, the product is written as \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\), so it does include \(k=0\), which corresponds to \(\omega^0 = 1\). So, the product is indeed over all 13th roots of unity, including 1. Therefore, the calculation above is correct, leading to 8321, which mod 1000 is 321.

Wait, but let me check again. Let me verify each step to make sure.

<prompt_12.1> Verify each step of the calculation to ensure no errors were made, especially in the modulus and argument steps for \((1 + i)^{13}\) and \((1 - i)^{13}\). </prompt_12.1>
</Plan_12>

<Execution_12>
<execution_12.1>
First, converting \(1 + i\) to polar form: modulus \(\sqrt{2}\), argument \(\pi/4\). Correct. Raising to 13th power: modulus \((\sqrt{2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64\sqrt{2}\). Correct. Angle: 13*(pi/4) = 13pi/4. Subtracting 2pi twice: 13pi/4 - 4pi = 13pi/4 - 16pi/4 = -3pi/4. But then adding 2pi again: -3pi/4 + 2pi = 5pi/4. Correct. So, angle 5pi/4. Then, cosine and sine of 5pi/4 are both -sqrt(2)/2. So, multiplying out, we get -64*sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)/2 = -64*2/2 = -64. Therefore, (1 + i)^13 = -64(1 + i). Similarly for (1 - i)^13. So, that seems correct.

Then, subtracting 1 from each: -64(1 + i) -1 = -65 -64i, and similarly for the other term. Then multiplying (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 + (64)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321. Correct. Then 8321 mod 1000 is 321. So, seems correct.

But wait, the problem says "Let \(\omega \neq 1\) be a 13th root of unity". So, does the product exclude \(\omega^0 = 1\)? Wait, no. The product is over k from 0 to 12, which includes k=0, so it includes \(\omega^0 = 1\). Therefore, the calculation is correct. Therefore, the answer is 321.

But let me check once more if there's a different approach, in case I made a mistake in the steps.

Alternatively, note that since \(\omega\) is a primitive 13th root of unity, the product over all \(\omega^k\) of (2 - 2\(\omega^k\) + \(\omega^{2k}\)) can be considered as the product over all \(\omega^k\) of (2 - 2z + z^2) where z = \(\omega^k\). Then, since z runs through all 13th roots of unity, the product is the product over z^{13} = 1 of (2 - 2z + z^2). Then, the product can be written as the product over all roots z of (z^2 - 2z + 2) = 0? Wait, no. Wait, for each z, we have a quadratic in z.

Alternatively, if we let P(z) = z^2 - 2z + 2, then the product over all 13th roots z of P(z). Then, since the product of P(z) over all roots z of x^13 -1 is equal to the resultant or something? Wait, perhaps using the fact that the product over all roots z of P(z) is equal to the resultant of x^13 -1 and P(x), but I might be mixing concepts here.

Alternatively, consider that the product over all z ≠1 of (2 - 2z + z^2) times (2 - 2*1 +1^2). Since the product over all roots z of P(z) is equal to the product over z^{13} =1 of P(z). So, if we can compute this product, it's equal to the resultant or something else. Alternatively, note that the product over all z ≠1 of (2 - 2z + z^2) is equal to the product over all z ≠1 of (z^2 - 2z + 2). Then, since the product over all z of (z^2 - 2z + 2) is equal to the product over all z of (z^2 - 2z + 2). But z runs over all 13th roots of unity. Then, this product can be related to evaluating a polynomial at certain points.

Alternatively, note that the product over all z ≠1 of (z^2 - 2z + 2) is equal to the resultant of x^13 -1 and x^2 - 2x + 2, divided by (1^2 - 2*1 + 2) = 1 -2 +2 =1. But maybe I need to recall that the product over all roots z of f(z) is equal to the resultant of f and x^13 -1. But I might be overcomplicating.

Alternatively, consider that the product over all z ≠1 of (z^2 - 2z + 2) = product_{z ≠1} (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)) = product_{z ≠1} (z - a)(z - b) = [product_{z} (z - a)(z - b)] / [(1 - a)(1 - b)]. Since product_{z} (z - a) = a^{13} -1, as before. Therefore, product_{z ≠1} (z - a) = (a^{13} -1)/(1 - a). Similarly for b. Therefore, the product over z ≠1 of (z -a)(z -b) = [ (a^{13} -1)/(1 -a) ] * [ (b^{13} -1)/(1 -b) ]. Then, the product over z ≠1 of (z^2 - 2z + 2) = [ (a^{13} -1)(b^{13} -1) ] / [ (1 -a)(1 -b) ]. Then, as before, since a =1 +i, b=1 -i, this becomes [ ((1 +i)^{13} -1)((1 -i)^{13} -1) ] / [ (1 - (1 +i))(1 - (1 -i)) ] = [ (-64(1 +i) -1)(-64(1 -i) -1) ] / [ (-i)(i) ] = ( (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) ) / ( -i^2 ) = (8321) / (1) =8321. Since denominator: (1 -a)(1 -b) = (1 -1 -i)(1 -1 +i) = (-i)(i) = -i^2 = -(-1) =1. Therefore, the product over z ≠1 of (z^2 -2z +2)=8321. Then, the original product is 8321. Therefore, same result. So, seems correct.

Therefore, the final answer is 321.

But wait, let me check if the problem states "Let \(\omega \neq 1\) be a 13th root of unity", so perhaps the product is over all 13th roots except 1, but in the problem statement, the product is written as \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\), which includes k=0 (i.e., \(\omega^0 =1\)). Therefore, maybe the problem is a bit ambiguous. Wait, let me check the original problem again.
