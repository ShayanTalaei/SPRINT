<Question>
Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.
</Question>

<think>
<Plan_1>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the least integer \( b \geq 2 \) such that there are more than ten \( b \)-eautiful integers. A number \( n \) is \( b \)-eautiful if two conditions are met: first, when \( n \) is expressed in base \( b \), it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals \( \sqrt{n} \).

<prompt_1.1> Read and understand the problem statement about \( b \)-eautiful numbers. Define the conditions for a number to be \( b \)-eautiful. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
The example given is 81 in base 13, which is written as 63 (since \( 6 \times 13 + 3 = 81 \)), and the sum of the digits 6 and 3 is 9, which is the square root of 81. So, the task is to find the smallest base \( b \) where there are more than ten such numbers.
</execution_1.1>
</Execution_1>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
First, let's parse the problem carefully. Let's break down the conditions for a number \( n \) to be \( b \)-eautiful:

1. \( n \) must have exactly two digits when expressed in base \( b \). That means in base \( b \), \( n \) is written as \( d_1 d_0 \), where \( d_1 \) and \( d_0 \) are digits in base \( b \). Since it's a two-digit number, \( d_1 \) must be between 1 and \( b-1 \) (since the leading digit can't be zero), and \( d_0 \) is between 0 and \( b-1 \).

<prompt_2.1> Express the conditions for a number \( n \) to be \( b \)-eautiful in terms of its digits \( d_1 \) and \( d_0 \) in base \( b \), and write the equation \( d_1 + d_0 = \sqrt{n} \). </prompt_2.1>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
2. The sum of these digits \( d_1 + d_0 \) must equal \( \sqrt{n} \).

So, translating the second condition into an equation, we have \( d_1 + d_0 = \sqrt{n} \). But \( n \) can also be expressed in base \( b \) as \( n = d_1 \times b + d_0 \). Therefore, substituting the expression for \( n \) into the equation from the second condition, we get:

\( d_1 + d_0 = \sqrt{d_1 \times b + d_0} \)

So, this is the key equation we need to solve for integers \( d_1, d_0, b \) where \( d_1 \in \{1, 2, \ldots, b-1\} \), \( d_0 \in \{0, 1, \ldots, b-1\} \), and \( b \geq 2 \).
</execution_2.1>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

\( (d_1 + d_0)^2 = d_1 \times b + d_0 \)

Which simplifies to:

\( d_1^2 + 2d_1d_0 + d_0^2 = d_1b + d_0 \)

Let's rearrange this equation:

\( d_1^2 + 2d_1d_0 + d_0^2 - d_1b - d_0 = 0 \)

This is a quadratic equation in terms of \( b \). Let's solve for \( b \):

<prompt_3.1> Rearrange the equation to isolate \( b \) and express it as a quadratic in \( d_1 \) and \( d_0 \). </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
\( d_1b = d_1^2 + 2d_1d_0 + d_0^2 - d_0 \)

Therefore,

\( b = \frac{d_1^2 + 2d_1d_0 + d_0^2 - d_0}{d_1} \)

Simplify the numerator:

\( d_1^2 + 2d_1d_0 + d_0^2 - d_0 = d_1^2 + d_0^2 + 2d_1d_0 - d_0 \)

So,

\( b = \frac{d_1^2 + d_0^2 + 2d_1d_0 - d_0}{d_1} \)

Break this into terms:

\( b = \frac{d_1^2}{d_1} + \frac{d_0^2}{d_1} + \frac{2d_1d_0}{d_1} - \frac{d_0}{d_1} \)

Simplify each term:

\( b = d_1 + \frac{d_0^2}{d_1} + 2d_0 - \frac{d_0}{d_1} \)

Combine the terms with \( \frac{d_0}{d_1} \):

\( b = d_1 + 2d_0 + \frac{d_0^2 - d_0}{d_1} \)

Therefore,

\( b = d_1 + 2d_0 + \frac{d_0(d_0 - 1)}{d_1} \)
</execution_3.1>
</Execution_3>

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
Since \( b \) must be an integer greater than or equal to 2, the term \( \frac{d_0(d_0 - 1)}{d_1} \) must also be an integer. Therefore, \( d_1 \) must divide \( d_0(d_0 - 1) \).

<prompt_4.1> Analyze the conditions under which \( b \) is an integer by requiring \( d_1 \) divides \( d_0(d_0 - 1) \). </prompt_4.1>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
So, \( d_1 \) divides \( d_0(d_0 - 1) \). Let's note that \( d_0 \) and \( d_0 - 1 \) are consecutive integers, so they are coprime. Therefore, \( d_1 \) must divide either \( d_0 \) or \( d_0 - 1 \), or be a divisor of their product. However, since \( d_1 \) is a digit in base \( b \), \( d_1 \) must be at least 1 and at most \( b - 1 \). Also, \( d_0 \) is between 0 and \( b - 1 \).

Given this, perhaps it's easier to approach the problem by considering possible values of \( d_1 \) and \( d_0 \), compute \( b \), and check if \( b \) is an integer greater than or equal to 2, and also verify that the original conditions hold (i.e., \( n = d_1 b + d_0 \) and \( d_1 + d_0 = \sqrt{n} \)).
</execution_4.1>
</Execution_4>

<Plan_5>
Based on execution_4.1:
Alternatively, since \( b \) must be an integer, we can consider for each base \( b \), how many pairs \( (d_1, d_0) \) satisfy the equation \( d_1 + d_0 = \sqrt{d_1 b + d_0} \) with \( 1 \leq d_1 \leq b - 1 \) and \( 0 \leq d_0 \leq b - 1 \). Then, we need to find the smallest \( b \) such that there are more than ten such pairs.

But since we need to find the minimal \( b \), we can start checking from smaller bases upwards until we find the first one where the count exceeds ten.

But this approach might be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps we can find a relationship between \( d_1 \) and \( d_0 \) that allows us to parameterize the possible solutions.

Alternatively, let's consider that \( d_1 + d_0 = \sqrt{n} \), and \( n = d_1 b + d_0 \). Let's denote \( s = d_1 + d_0 \).

<prompt_5.1> Let \( s = d_1 + d_0 \) and \( n = d_1 b + d_0 \), then express \( s = \sqrt{n} \) and derive an equation involving \( b \), \( d_1 \), and \( d_0 \). </prompt_5.1>
</Plan_5>

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
Then, \( s = \sqrt{n} \), so \( n = s^2 \). Therefore, substituting into the expression for \( n \):

\( s^2 = d_1 b + d_0 \)

But \( s = d_1 + d_0 \), so:

\( (d_1 + d_0)^2 = d_1 b + d_0 \)

Which is the same equation as before. So, expanding:

\( d_1^2 + 2d_1 d_0 + d_0^2 = d_1 b + d_0 \)

Rearranged:

\( d_1^2 + 2d_1 d_0 + d_0^2 - d_0 = d_1 b \)

Therefore,

\( b = \frac{d_1^2 + 2d_1 d_0 + d_0^2 - d_0}{d_1} \)

Simplify:

\( b = d_1 + 2d_0 + \frac{d_0^2 - d_0}{d_1} \)

So, \( b \) must be an integer. Therefore, \( \frac{d_0^2 - d_0}{d_1} \) must be an integer. Let's denote this term as \( k \), where \( k \) is an integer. Therefore,

\( \frac{d_0(d_0 - 1)}{d_1} = k \)

Which implies that \( d_1 \) divides \( d_0(d_0 - 1) \). Since \( d_1 \) and \( d_0 \) are digits in base \( b \), \( d_1 \) is between 1 and \( b - 1 \), and \( d_0 \) is between 0 and \( b - 1 \).

Given that \( d_0 \) and \( d_0 - 1 \) are consecutive integers, they are coprime. Therefore, \( d_1 \) must divide either \( d_0 \) or \( d_0 - 1 \). However, since \( d_1 \) is a digit in base \( b \), which is at least 1 and less than \( b \), the possible divisors of \( d_0(d_0 - 1) \) must be factors of either \( d_0 \) or \( d_0 - 1 \).
</execution_5.1>
</Execution_5>

<Plan_6>
Based on execution_5.1:
So, \( d_1 \) must be a divisor of either \( d_0 \) or \( d_0 - 1 \). Let's explore this.

Case 1: \( d_1 \) divides \( d_0 \).

<prompt_6.1> Analyze the case where \( d_1 \) divides \( d_0 \), express \( d_0 = m d_1 \), and derive expressions for \( b \) and \( s \). </prompt_6.1>

Case 2: \( d_1 \) divides \( d_0 - 1 \).

<prompt_6.2> Analyze the case where \( d_1 \) divides \( d_0 - 1 \), express \( d_0 - 1 = m d_1 \), and derive expressions for \( b \) and \( s \). </prompt_6.2>
</Plan_6>

<Execution_6>
<execution_6.1>
Then, \( d_0 = m d_1 \) for some integer \( m \geq 1 \). However, since \( d_0 \) is a digit in base \( b \), \( d_0 < b \), so \( m d_1 < b \). Since \( d_1 \geq 1 \) and \( m \geq 1 \), the maximum possible \( m \) is such that \( m d_1 \leq b - 1 \). But since \( b \) is variable, perhaps we can parameterize \( m \).

But this approach might not be straightforward. Alternatively, since \( d_1 \) divides \( d_0 \), we can let \( d_0 = m d_1 \), where \( m \) is a positive integer. Then, substituting back into the equation for \( b \):

\( k = \frac{d_0(d_0 - 1)}{d_1} = \frac{m d_1 (m d_1 - 1)}{d_1} = m (m d_1 - 1) \)

Therefore,

\( b = d_1 + 2d_0 + k = d_1 + 2m d_1 + m (m d_1 - 1) \)

Simplify:

\( b = d_1 + 2m d_1 + m^2 d_1 - m \)

Factor:

\( b = d_1(1 + 2m + m^2) - m \)

Note that \( 1 + 2m + m^2 = (m + 1)^2 \), so:

\( b = d_1 (m + 1)^2 - m \)

Therefore, \( b = d_1 (m + 1)^2 - m \)
</execution_6.1>

<execution_6.2>
Case 1: \( d_1 \) divides \( d_0 \). Let \( d_0 = k d_1 \) for some integer \( k \geq 1 \). Then, since \( d_0 \leq b - 1 \), \( k \leq \frac{b - 1}{d_1} \). But \( d_0 = k d_1 \leq b - 1 \), so \( k \leq \frac{b - 1}{d_1} \). Since \( d_1 \geq 1 \), \( k \) can be up to \( b - 1 \).

But substituting \( d_0 = k d_1 \) into the equation for \( b \):

\( b = d_1 + 2(k d_1) + \frac{(k d_1)^2 - k d_1}{d_1} \)

Simplify:

\( b = d_1 + 2k d_1 + \frac{k^2 d_1^2 - k d_1}{d_1} \)

Simplify term by term:

First term: \( d_1 \)

Second term: \( 2k d_1 \)

Third term: \( \frac{k^2 d_1^2}{d_1} - \frac{k d_1}{d_1} = k^2 d_1 - k \)

Therefore, combining all terms:

\( b = d_1 + 2k d_1 + k^2 d_1 - k \)

Factor \( d_1 \) where possible:

\( b = d_1(1 + 2k + k^2) - k \)

Note that \( 1 + 2k + k^2 = (k + 1)^2 \), so:

\( b = d_1(k + 1)^2 - k \)

But since \( b \) must be an integer greater than or equal to 2, and \( d_1 \) is a digit in base \( b \), which is less than \( b \), we have \( d_1 \leq b - 1 \).

<Plan_7>
Based on execution_6.1, execution_6.2:
Alternatively, consider the second case where \( d_1 \) divides \( d_0 - 1 \). Let \( d_0 - 1 = m d_1 \), so \( d_0 = m d_1 + 1 \). Then, substituting into the equation for \( b \):

\( b = d_1 + 2(m d_1 + 1) + \frac{(m d_1 + 1)^2 - (m d_1 + 1)}{d_1} \)

<prompt_7.1> Using the case where \( d_1 \) divides \( d_0 - 1 \), express \( d_0 = m d_1 + 1 \), and derive expressions for \( b \) and \( s \). </prompt_7.1>
</Plan_7>

<Execution_7>
<execution_7.1>
Simplify step by step:

First, compute each part:

1. \( d_1 \) is as is.

2. \( 2(m d_1 + 1) = 2m d_1 + 2 \)

3. The fraction:

Numerator: \( (m d_1 + 1)^2 - (m d_1 + 1) = (m^2 d_1^2 + 2m d_1 + 1) - m d_1 - 1 = m^2 d_1^2 + m d_1 \)

Therefore, the fraction becomes \( \frac{m^2 d_1^2 + m d_1}{d_1} = m^2 d_1 + m \)

Therefore, combining all terms:

\( b = d_1 + 2m d_1 + 2 + m^2 d_1 + m \)

Factor terms with \( d_1 \):

\( b = d_1(1 + 2m + m^2) + m + 2 \)

Again, \( 1 + 2m + m^2 = (m + 1)^2 \), so:

\( b = d_1(m + 1)^2 + m + 2 \)
</execution_7.1>
</Execution_7>

<Plan_8>
Based on execution_7.1:
But in this case, \( d_0 = m d_1 + 1 \), and since \( d_0 \leq b - 1 \), we have:

\( m d_1 + 1 \leq b - 1 \)

<prompt_8.1> Using \( d_0 = m d_1 + 1 \), find constraints on \( m \) and \( d_1 \), and express \( b \) in terms of \( m \) and \( d_1 \). </prompt_8.1>
</Plan_8>

<Execution_8>
<execution_8.1>
Therefore,

\( m d_1 \leq b - 2 \)

But since \( b = d_1(m + 1)^2 + m + 2 \), substituting:

\( m d_1 \leq d_1(m + 1)^2 + m + 2 - 2 \)

Simplify the right-hand side:

\( d_1(m + 1)^2 + m \)

Therefore,

\( m d_1 \leq d_1(m^2 + 2m + 1) + m \)

Divide both sides by \( m \) (assuming \( m > 0 \)):

\( d_1 \leq d_1(m + 2 + \frac{1}{m}) + 1 \)

But this seems complicated. Maybe this approach is getting too tangled. Perhaps instead of splitting into cases, we can look for a general solution.

Alternatively, going back to the equation:

\( b = d_1 + 2d_0 + \frac{d_0(d_0 - 1)}{d_1} \)

We can think of this as:

For given \( d_1 \) and \( d_0 \), compute \( b \) and check if it's an integer and if \( n = d_1 b + d_0 = s^2 \) where \( s = d_1 + d_0 \).

But since \( s = d_1 + d_0 \), and \( n = s^2 \), we have:

\( s^2 = d_1 b + d_0 \)

But \( s = d_1 + d_0 \), so:

\( (d_1 + d_0)^2 = d_1 b + d_0 \)

Which again brings us back to the same equation.
</execution_8.1>
</Execution_8>

<Plan_9>
Based on execution_8.1:
Therefore, the key equation is:

\( d_1^2 + 2d_1d_0 + d_0^2 = d_1 b + d_0 \)

Rearranged:

\( d_1^2 + 2d_1d_0 + d_0^2 - d_0 = d_1 b \)

Therefore,

\( b = \frac{d_1^2 + 2d_1d_0 + d_0^2 - d_0}{d_1} \)

Simplify numerator:

\( d_1^2 + 2d_1d_0 + d_0^2 - d_0 = d_1^2 + d_0^2 + 2d_1d_0 - d_0 \)

Breaking into terms:

\( b = \frac{d_1^2}{d_1} + \frac{2d_1d_0}{d_1} + \frac{d_0^2}{d_1} - \frac{d_0}{d_1} \)

Simplify each term:

\( b = d_1 + 2d_0 + \frac{d_0^2 - d_0}{d_1} \)

Therefore,

\( b = d_1 + 2d_0 + \frac{d_0(d_0 - 1)}{d_1} \)

Since \( b \) must be an integer, the term \( \frac{d_0(d_0 - 1)}{d_1} \) must be an integer. Let's denote this term as \( k \), so \( k = \frac{d_0(d_0 - 1)}{d_1} \). Therefore, \( k \) is an integer, and \( d_1 \) must divide \( d_0(d_0 - 1) \).

Hence, \( d_1 \) divides \( d_0(d_0 - 1) \). Given that \( d_0 \) and \( d_0 - 1 \) are coprime (since consecutive integers are coprime), \( d_1 \) must divide either \( d_0 \) or \( d_0 - 1 \).

</Execution_10>

<Plan_11>
Based on execution_10.1:
Let \( d_0 = k d_1 \) for some integer \( k \geq 1 \). Then, since \( d_0 < b \), we have \( k d_1 < b \).

<execution_11.1>
Substituting \( d_0 = k d_1 \) into the equation for \( b \):

\( b = d_1 + 2(k d_1) + \frac{(k d_1)(k d_1 - 1)}{d_1} \)

Simplify term by term:

First term: \( d_1 \)

Second term: \( 2k d_1 \)

Third term: \( \frac{k^2 d_1^2 - k d_1}{d_1} = k^2 d_1 - k \)

Therefore,

\( b = d_1 + 2k d_1 + k^2 d_1 - k \)

Factor \( d_1 \) terms:

\( b = d_1(1 + 2k + k^2) - k \)

Note that \( 1 + 2k + k^2 = (k + 1)^2 \), so:

\( b = d_1(k + 1)^2 - k \)

Since \( b \) must be an integer greater than or equal to 2, and \( d_1 \) is a digit in base \( b \), \( d_1 \leq b - 1 \). Substituting \( b \) from the equation:

\( d_1 \leq d_1(k + 1)^2 - k - 1 \)

Simplify:

\( d_1(k + 1)^2 - k - 1 \geq d_1 \)

Subtract \( d_1 \) from both sides:

\( d_1(k + 1)^2 - d_1 - k - 1 \geq 0 \)

Factor \( d_1 \):

\( d_1[(k + 1)^2 - 1] - k - 1 \geq 0 \)

Compute \( (k + 1)^2 - 1 = k^2 + 2k + 1 - 1 = k^2 + 2k \). Therefore:

\( d_1(k^2 + 2k) - k - 1 \geq 0 \)

Factor \( k \):

\( d_1 k(k + 2) - (k + 1) \geq 0 \)

So,

\( d_1 k(k + 2) \geq k + 1 \)

Since \( k \geq 1 \), we can divide both sides by \( k \):

\( d_1(k + 2) \geq 1 + \frac{1}{k} \)

Since \( \frac{1}{k} \leq 1 \), this simplifies to:

\( d_1(k + 2) \geq 2 \)

But \( d_1 \geq 1 \), so this inequality is always true for \( k \geq 1 \) and \( d_1 \geq 1 \). Therefore, the key constraint here is that \( d_0 = k d_1 \leq b - 1 \), and \( b = d_1(k + 1)^2 - k \).

Therefore, given \( k \geq 1 \), \( d_1 \geq 1 \), and \( d_0 = k d_1 \leq b - 1 = d_1(k + 1)^2 - k - 1 \), we can parameterize \( d_1 \) and \( k \) to find possible bases \( b \).

Simplify term by term:

First term: \( d_1 \)

Second term: \( 2(m d_1 + 1) = 2m d_1 + 2 \)

Third term: \( \frac{(m^2 d_1^2 + 2m d_1 + 1) - (m d_1 + 1)}{d_1} = \frac{m^2 d_1^2 + m d_1}{d_1} = m^2 d_1 + m \)

Therefore, combining all terms:

\( b = d_1 + 2m d_1 + 2 + m^2 d_1 + m \)

Factor \( d_1 \):

\( b = d_1(1 + 2m + m^2) + m + 2 \)

Again, \( 1 + 2m + m^2 = (m + 1)^2 \), so:

\( b = d_1(m + 1)^2 + m + 2 \)

Since \( d_0 = m d_1 + 1 \leq b - 1 \), we have:

\( m d_1 + 1 \leq d_1(m + 1)^2 + m + 2 - 1 \)

Simplify the right-hand side:

\( d_1(m + 1)^2 + m + 1 \)

Therefore,

\( m d_1 + 1 \leq d_1(m + 1)^2 + m + 1 \)

Subtract \( m + 1 \) from both sides:

\( m d_1 \leq d_1(m + 1)^2 \)

Divide both sides by \( d_1 \) (since \( d_1 \geq 1 \)):

\( m \leq (m + 1)^2 \)

Which simplifies to:

\( 0 \leq m^2 + m - m \)

Wait, expanding \( (m + 1)^2 = m^2 + 2m + 1 \), so:

\( m \leq m^2 + 2m + 1 \)

Subtract \( m \) from both sides:

\( 0 \leq m^2 + m + 1 \)

Which is always true since \( m \geq 1 \). Therefore, the inequality holds for all \( m \geq 1 \). Therefore, the key constraint here is \( d_0 = m d_1 + 1 \leq b - 1 = d_1(m + 1)^2 + m + 1 - 1 = d_1(m + 1)^2 + m \). Wait, let's check again:

Wait, \( b = d_1(m + 1)^2 + m + 2 \), so \( b - 1 = d_1(m + 1)^2 + m + 1 \). Therefore, \( d_0 = m d_1 + 1 \leq d_1(m + 1)^2 + m + 1 \). Therefore:

\( m d_1 + 1 \leq d_1(m + 1)^2 + m + 1 \)

Subtract \( m + 1 \) from both sides:

\( m d_1 \leq d_1(m + 1)^2 \)

Divide both sides by \( d_1 \):

\( m \leq (m + 1)^2 \)

Which is true for all \( m \geq 1 \). Therefore, the only constraints here are \( d_1 \geq 1 \), \( m \geq 1 \), and \( d_0 = m d_1 + 1 \leq b - 1 = d_1(m + 1)^2 + m + 1 - 1 = d_1(m + 1)^2 + m \). Therefore, \( m d_1 + 1 \leq d_1(m + 1)^2 + m \). Simplifying:

\( m d_1 + 1 \leq d_1(m^2 + 2m + 1) + m \)

Simplify right-hand side:

\( d_1 m^2 + 2 d_1 m + d_1 + m \)

Left-hand side: \( m d_1 + 1 \)

Subtract left-hand side from right-hand side:

\( d_1 m^2 + 2 d_1 m + d_1 + m - m d_1 - 1 = d_1 m^2 + d_1 m + d_1 + m - 1 \)

Which is always positive for \( d_1 \geq 1 \) and \( m \geq 1 \). Therefore, the inequality holds, so no additional constraints beyond \( d_1 \geq 1 \) and \( m \geq 1 \).

Therefore, in both cases, we can parameterize \( b \) in terms of \( d_1 \) and \( k \) or \( m \), depending on the case.

<Plan_13>
Based on execution_12.1:
Now, our goal is to find all bases \( b \geq 2 \) such that there are more than ten \( n \)-eautiful integers. Each \( n \)-eautiful integer corresponds to a pair \( (d_1, d_0) \) in base \( b \), where \( d_1 + d_0 = \sqrt{n} \), and \( n = d_1 b + d_0 \). So, for each base \( b \), we need to find all pairs \( (d_1, d_0) \) satisfying the above conditions, count them, and check if the count exceeds ten.
Based on execution_12.1:
Therefore, the plan is:

1. For each base \( b \geq 2 \), iterate through possible values of \( d_1 \) and \( k \) (for case 1) or \( m \) (for case 2), compute \( d_0 \) and check if it is a valid digit in base \( b \). If so, compute \( n = d_1 b + d_0 \), and check if \( n = (d_1 + d_0)^2 \). If all conditions are satisfied, count this as a valid \( n \)-eautiful integer.

But this seems computationally intensive. Alternatively, perhaps we can find a formula for the number of solutions for a given \( b \).

Alternatively, since we need to find the least \( b \) with more than ten solutions, perhaps we can find a formula for the number of solutions in terms of \( b \), and then find the minimal \( b \) such that the number of solutions exceeds ten.

Alternatively, note that the equation \( (d_1 + d_0)^2 = d_1 b + d_0 \) can be rewritten as:

\( (d_1 + d_0)^2 - d_0 = d_1 b \)

Therefore,

\( b = \frac{(d_1 + d_0)^2 - d_0}{d_1} \)

Let \( s = d_1 + d_0 \), then:

\( b = \frac{s^2 - d_0}{d_1} \)

But since \( s = d_1 + d_0 \), we can write \( d_0 = s - d_1 \). Substitute back into the equation:

\( b = \frac{s^2 - (s - d_1)}{d_1} = \frac{s^2 - s + d_1}{d_1} = \frac{s^2 - s}{d_1} + 1 \)

Therefore,

\( b = \frac{s(s - 1)}{d_1} + 1 \)

Since \( b \) must be an integer, \( \frac{s(s - 1)}{d_1} \) must be an integer. Therefore, \( d_1 \) must divide \( s(s - 1) \). Given that \( d_1 \) is a digit in base \( b \), \( 1 \leq d_1 < b \), and \( d_0 = s - d_1 \) must satisfy \( 0 \leq d_0 < b \). Therefore, \( s - d_1 < b \), so \( s < b + d_1 \).
