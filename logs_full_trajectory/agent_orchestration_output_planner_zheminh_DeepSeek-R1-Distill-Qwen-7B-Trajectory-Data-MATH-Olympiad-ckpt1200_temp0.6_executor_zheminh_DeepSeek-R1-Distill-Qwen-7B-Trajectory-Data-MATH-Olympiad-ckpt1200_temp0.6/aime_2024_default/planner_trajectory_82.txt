</Question>

<think>
<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to find the sum of the squares of all the items in a list that meets certain conditions. Let me start by listing out the given information and then try to deduce the possible structure of the list.

<prompt_1.1> Read the problem statement and list out the given conditions. Then plan to start deducing the possible structure of the list by analyzing the conditions. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
First, the sum of the items is 30. That means if I add up all the numbers in the list, the total is 30. Second, the unique mode is 9. Mode means the number that appears most frequently, and unique mode means 9 is the only number that repeats more times than any other number in the list. Third, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. The median is the middle number when the list is ordered from smallest to largest. Since the median is a positive integer not in the list, that gives us some constraints on the list's length and the numbers present.

Let me recall that for a list with an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element. For even, it's the average of the two middle numbers. But the problem states the median is a positive integer, so if the list has an even number of elements, the average of the two middle numbers must be an integer. That implies that the two middle numbers must be equal or differ by an even number. However, since the median is not in the list itself, even in the case of an even-length list, the average of the two middle numbers is an integer not present in the list. But if the two middle numbers are equal, then that number would be the mode, which is 9. However, the mode is unique, so if 9 is the mode, it must appear more times than any other number. But if the two middle numbers are both 9, then 9 is the median, which is not allowed because the median cannot be in the list. Therefore, in the case of an even-length list, the two middle numbers must be different, but their average is an integer. Let me note that down.

So, if the list has an even number of elements, say 2k, then the median is (a_k + a_{k+1})/2, which must be an integer, so a_k + a_{k+1} is even. Also, since the median is not in the list, neither a_k nor a_{k+1} can be equal to the median. Additionally, the unique mode is 9, so 9 must appear more times than any other number. Also, the median is a positive integer, so it's at least 1.

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Now, let's think about the possible length of the list. Let's denote the number of elements as n.

<prompt_2.1> Analyze the possible length of the list (n) considering the conditions on the median and mode, and conclude the parity of n. </prompt_2.1>

Let me check if n=5 is possible.

<prompt_2.2> For n=5, analyze the constraints on the list and check if it can satisfy all conditions (sum=30, mode=9, median not in list). </prompt_2.2>

Wait, let's see.

<prompt_2.3> For n=5, analyze the constraints on the list and check if it can satisfy all conditions (sum=30, mode=9, median not in list). </prompt_2.3>

But let me check if n=5 is possible.

<prompt_2.4> For n=5, analyze the constraints on the list and check if it can satisfy all conditions (sum=30, mode=9, median not in list). </prompt_2.4>

Now, let's check the mode.

<prompt_2.5> For the list [1, 2, 9, 9, 17], verify that the mode is 9 and the median is 9. </prompt_2.5>

But the problem states that the unique mode is 9. So in this case, 9 appears twice, and all other numbers appear once. Therefore, the mode is 9, which is unique. However, the median is 9, which is in the list. But the problem states that the median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list. Therefore, this case is invalid.

So n=5 is not possible. Therefore, n must be even. Let's check n=6.

<prompt_2.6> For n=6, analyze the constraints on the list and check if it can satisfy all conditions (sum=30, mode=9, median not in list). </prompt_2.6>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
If n is odd, the median is the middle number, which would have to be 9 if 9 is the mode. But the problem states the median is not in the list, so the median can't be 9. Therefore, n cannot be odd. Therefore, n must be even. Because if n is odd, the median would be the middle element, which would have to be 9, but that's not allowed. Therefore, n must be even. So n is even. Let's note that down: n is even.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
If n=5, then the median is the 3rd number. The median is a positive integer not in the list. The sum is 30. The mode is 9. So, 9 must appear more times than any other number. Let's try to construct such a list. Since the median is the 3rd number, which is not in the list, the 3rd number is not 9. Also, 9 must appear at least twice, but more than any other number. Let's suppose 9 appears twice. Then the other three numbers must appear once each. But if 9 is the mode, it must appear more than any other number. So if the other numbers appear once, 9 is the mode with two appearances. But the median is the 3rd number, which is not 9. So, the list in order would be [a, b, c, d, e], where c is the median, not equal to 9. The two 9s must be in positions 4 and 5, but that would make the median the 3rd element, which is c. But if c is not 9, then the two 9s are in positions 4 and 5, so the list would be [a, b, c, 9, 9], with c < 9. Then the sum is a + b + c + 9 + 9 = 30, so a + b + c = 12. The median is c, which is not in the list. Wait, but c is in the list. Wait, the list is [a, b, c, 9, 9], so c is the third element and is part of the list. So the median is c, which is in the list. But the problem states that the median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list. Therefore, c cannot be in the list. Therefore, in the case of n=5, the median would have to be a number not present in the list, but the list is of length 5, so the third element is part of the list. Therefore, the median must be in the list, which contradicts the condition. Therefore, n=5 is impossible.
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
If the list has an odd number of elements, say 5, then the median is the middle number, which would have to be 9, but the problem says the median is not in the list. Therefore, n cannot be 5. Similarly, for n=7, the median would be the 4th number, which would have to be 9 if it's the unique mode. But again, the median can't be in the list. So n must be even. Therefore, the list has an even number of elements, say 2k, and the median is the average of the k-th and (k+1)-th numbers, which must be an integer not present in the list.
</execution_2.3>

<execution_2.4>
If n=5, then the list has 5 elements. Let's see if that's possible. The sum is 30, so the average is 6. The median is the third element. The median is not in the list, so the third element is not equal to 9. Since the mode is 9, 9 must appear at least twice. But if there are two 9s, then the list would have to be something like [a, b, 9, 9, e], where a ≤ b ≤ 9 ≤ e. Wait, but the median is the third element, which is 9, but the problem states that the median is not in the list. Therefore, n=5 is impossible because the median would have to be 9, which is in the list. So n=5 is invalid.
</execution_2.4>

<execution_2.5>
If the list is [1, 2, 9, 9, 17], the mode is 9 (appears twice), which is unique. The median is the third element, which is 9. But the problem says the median is not in the list. So this list doesn't satisfy the third condition. Therefore, n=5 is invalid.

So the list must have an even number of elements. Let's check n=6. Then the median would be the average of the third and fourth elements. Let's denote the sorted list as a1 ≤ a2 ≤ a3 ≤ a4 ≤ a5 ≤ a6. Then the median is (a3 + a4)/2, which must be an integer. Therefore, a3 + a4 must be even. Also, the median is not in the list, so neither a3 nor a4 can be equal to the median. The mode is 9, unique, so 9 appears more times than any other number. Let's see.

Also, the sum is 30. Let's try to construct such a list.

Since the mode is 9, and it's unique, 9 must appear at least twice, and more times than any other number. Let's try to have 9 appear three times. Then other numbers can appear at most two times. Let's see.

Let me start by assuming the list has 6 elements. Let's try to construct such a list.

Let me denote the sorted list as [a, b, c, d, e, f]. The sum is a + b + c + d + e + f = 30. The median is (c + d)/2, which is an integer not in the list. The mode is 9, which appears more frequently than any other number. Let's suppose 9 appears three times. Then the other three numbers must appear at most twice.

But wait, if 9 appears three times, then the other numbers can appear at most two times. Since there are six numbers, three 9s take up three positions, leaving three positions for other numbers. If each of those three numbers appears at most twice, then we can have two numbers appearing twice and one number appearing once. Wait, but two numbers can't each appear twice because that would take four positions, but we only have three positions left. So that's not possible. Alternatively, one number appears twice and another appears once. That would take three positions. So, for example, [9,9,9, x, x, y], where x and y are different numbers.

But in this case, the mode is 9 (three times), and x appears twice, which is less than three, so that's okay. Then the median is (c + d)/2. Here, c and d are the third and fourth elements. If the list is [9,9,9, x, x, y], then c=9, d=x. Therefore, the median is (9 + x)/2. This must be an integer, so 9 + x must be even. Therefore, x must be odd. Also, the median is not in the list. The list contains 9, x, x, y. So the median (9 + x)/2 must not be equal to any of these numbers. Let's check.

First, 9 + x must be even, so x is odd. Let's suppose x is some odd number different from 9. Let's try x=5. Then the median is (9 +5)/2=7. So 7 must not be in the list. The list is [9,9,9,5,5,y]. The sum is 9+9+9+5+5+y=37 + y. But the total sum must be 30, so 37 + y =30 ⇒ y= -7. But y must be a positive integer. So that's invalid.

Next, try x=7. Then the median is (9 +7)/2=8. So 8 must not be in the list. The list would be [9,9,9,7,7,y]. Sum is 9+9+9+7+7+y=41 + y=30 ⇒ y= -11. Again negative. Not allowed.

x=3: median=(9+3)/2=6. Not in the list. List: [9,9,9,3,3,y]. Sum=9+9+9+3+3+y=33 + y=30 ⇒ y= -3. Negative. No good.

x=1: median=(9+1)/2=5. Not in the list. List: [9,9,9,1,1,y]. Sum=9+9+9+1+1+y=29 + y=30 ⇒ y=1. So y=1. Then the list would be [9,9,9,1,1,1], but that's three 9s and three 1s. Wait, but then the mode would be both 9 and 1, each appearing three times. But the problem states the unique mode is 9. Therefore, this is invalid. So this case is not possible.

Wait, but in the list [9,9,9,1,1,1], the mode is both 9 and 1, each appearing three times, which contradicts the unique mode. Therefore, invalid.

Alternatively, maybe x=11. Then median=(9+11)/2=10. Not in the list. But the list would be [9,9,9,11,11,y]. Sum=9+9+9+11+11+y=49 + y=30 ⇒ y= -19. Negative. Not allowed.

Hmm, this approach isn't working. Let's try a different configuration.

Suppose 9 appears four times. Then the other two numbers must appear at most three times, but since there are six elements, 9 appears four times, so the other two numbers can appear once each. Then the list would be [9,9,9,9, x, y]. The median is (9 +9)/2=9. But the median is 9, which is in the list, which violates the condition. So that's invalid.

Alternatively, if 9 appears three times, and the other three numbers are different. So [9,9,9, a, b, c], where a, b, c are distinct. Then the median is (9 + a)/2. This must be an integer not in the list. So (9 + a) must be even. Therefore, a is odd. Let's try a=7. Then median=(9+7)/2=8. So 8 must not be in the list. The list is [9,9,9,7, b, c]. The sum is 9+9+9+7 + b + c=34 + b + c=30 ⇒ b + c= -4. Not possible. Negative.

Alternatively, a=5. Then median=7. Then the list is [9,9,9,5, b, c]. Sum=9+9+9+5 + b + c=32 + b + c=30 ⇒ b + c= -2. Still negative.

a=3. Median=6. List: [9,9,9,3, b, c]. Sum=9+9+9+3 + b + c=30 + b + c=30 ⇒ b + c=0. So b and c must be zero, but they must be positive integers. Not possible.

Wait, maybe a is a larger number. Let's see. If a is 17, then median=(9+17)/2=13. Not in the list. Then the list is [9,9,9,17, b, c]. Sum=9+9+9+17 + b + c=44 + b + c=30 ⇒ b + c= -14. Not possible.

This approach isn't working. Maybe 9 appears three times, and two other numbers each appear twice. Wait, but 9 appears three times, and the other three numbers can appear at most two times each. If two numbers appear twice, that's four positions, but we have three remaining positions. So that's not possible. Therefore, we can have one number appearing twice and another appearing once.

Wait, but in that case, the sum would be 9*3 + x*2 + y*1=27 + 2x + y=30 ⇒ 2x + y=3. Since x and y are positive integers, possible solutions: x=1, y=1. Then the list is [9,9,9,1,1,1]. But as before, mode is both 9 and 1, which is invalid. So no good.

Alternatively, x=2, y=-1. Not possible. So no solution here.

Hmm, perhaps n=6 is not possible. Let's check n=8.
</execution_2.5>

<execution_2.6>
Let's check n=6.

If n=6, then the median is (a_3 + a_4)/2. This must be an integer, so a_3 + a_4 is even. Also, the median is not in the list, so neither a_3 nor a_4 is equal to the median. The mode is 9, which must appear more times than any other number.

In the list, 9 must appear at least twice, but since it's the unique mode, it must appear more times than any other number. So, if 9 appears three times, then all other numbers can appear at most two times. But since the total sum is 30, let's see if that's possible.

Let me try to construct such a list. Let's start with the median condition. Let’s denote the median as m, which is (a_3 + a_4)/2. Since m is not in the list, and a_3 and a_4 are integers, m must be an integer. Also, since the list is in order, a_3 <= a_4. Since m is not in the list, a_3 and a_4 must be such that their average is m, which is not present. Also, since 9 is the mode, it must appear more frequently than any other number. Let's suppose 9 appears three times.

So, in the list of six elements, three 9s, and the other three numbers must be such that none of them appears more than two times. Also, the sum of all numbers is 30.
</execution_2.6>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.6:
Let's try to make the list. Let me start by assuming three 9s.
Suppose the list is [a, b, 9, 9, c, d]. The median is (9 + 9)/2=9. But the median is 9, which is in the list, which violates the condition. Therefore, the three 9s cannot be in the middle positions. Therefore, the three 9s must be spread out such that the median is not in the list.

Wait, if n=6, the median is (a_3 + a_4)/2. So if a_3 and a_4 are not 9, then the median is not 9. Alternatively, if one of them is 9, but then the other would have to be such that their average is not 9. Let's see.

<prompt_3.1> For n=6, analyze the possible positions of the three 9s in the sorted list and check if the median can be an integer not in the list. </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
If 9 is the mode, it must appear three times. So if three 9s are in the list, the median is (a_3 + a_4)/2. If a_3 and a_4 are both 9, then the median is 9, which is in the list. Not allowed. Therefore, to avoid the median being 9, the three 9s must not be in the middle positions. So perhaps the three 9s are towards the end or the beginning.

Wait, for example, if the list is [1, 1, 9, 9, 9, d]. Then the median is (9 + 9)/2=9, which is in the list. Not allowed. Alternatively, [a, 9, 9, 9, b, c]. The median is (9 + 9)/2=9. Still in the list. So no good.

Alternatively, maybe the three 9s are not consecutive. For example, [1, 9, 9, 9, 10, d]. The median is (9 + 9)/2=9, still in the list. Not allowed.

Alternatively, [a, b, 9, 9, c, d]. The median is (9 + 9)/2=9. Still in the list. Not good.

Alternatively, [a, 9, b, 9, c, d]. The median is (b + 9)/2. For this to be an integer, b + 9 must be even. So b must be odd. The median is (b + 9)/2, which must not be in the list. The list is [a, 9, b, 9, c, d]. The numbers a, b, c, d must be positive integers. The sum is a + 9 + b + 9 + c + d = a + b + c + d + 18 = 30 ⇒ a + b + c + d = 12. Also, 9 is the mode, appearing twice. Wait, but if there are two 9s, then the mode is 9 (appearing twice), but the problem says the mode is unique. Therefore, 9 must appear more than any other number. So if 9 appears twice, then all other numbers must appear at most once. But in this case, we have two 9s, and a, b, c, d must be distinct or appear once each. Wait, but a, b, c, d are four numbers. If 9 appears twice, then the other four numbers can appear at most once each. So the list would have two 9s, and four other distinct numbers. But then the total sum would be 9 + 9 + a + b + c + d = 18 + a + b + c + d = 30 ⇒ a + b + c + d = 12. Each of a, b, c, d must be distinct positive integers. Let's see if that's possible.

But the median is (b + 9)/2, which must not be in the list. Let's try to construct such a list.

Let’s take a=1. Then the list starts with 1, 9, b, 9, c, d. The sum is 1 + 9 + b + 9 + c + d = 19 + b + c + d =30 ⇒ b + c + d =11. Since a=1, and the list is sorted, we have 1 ≤ b ≤9, and the next numbers must be ≥9. Wait, but if a=1, then the next number is 9, so b must be ≥9. But if b is ≥9, then b + c + d =11, which is impossible because b ≥9, so b + c + d ≥9 +1 +1=11. Therefore, b + c + d=11, so b=9, c=1, d=1. But then the list would be [1,9,9,9,1,1], but that's not sorted properly. Wait, sorted list would be [1,1,9,9,9,9], but that has four 9s, which would make the mode 9 with four appearances. Then the median is (9 +9)/2=9, which is in the list. Not allowed. So this approach is not working.

Alternatively, maybe a=2. Then the sum of b + c + d=12 -2=10. So b + c + d=10. But since b≥9 (because the list is sorted and after the first element 2, the next element is 9), which is impossible because 9 +1 +1=11>10. Therefore, a cannot be 2. Similarly, a=3 would require b + c + d=7, which is even worse. So this approach isn't working.

Therefore, maybe n=6 is not possible. Let's try n=8.
</execution_3.1>
</Execution_3>

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
Then the median is the average of the 4th and 5th elements. Let's denote the sorted list as [a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h]. The median is (d + e)/2. This must be an integer, so d + e is even. The median is not in the list, so d and e are such that their average is not present in the list. The mode is 9, which must appear more times than any other number.

Let's try to construct such a list. Let's assume 9 appears three times. Then the other five numbers must appear at most twice each. The sum is 8 numbers adding to 30. Let's see.

<prompt_4.1> For n=8, analyze the possible positions of the three 9s and check if the median can be an integer not in the list. </prompt_4.1>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
If 9 appears three times, then the remaining five numbers must sum to 30 - 3*9 = 30 - 27 = 3. That's too low. So 9 can't appear three times. Therefore, 9 must appear four times. Then the remaining four numbers must sum to 30 - 4*9 = 30 - 36 = -6. Not possible. Therefore, 9 must appear at least four times, but that's impossible because the sum would exceed 30. Therefore, n=8 is invalid.

Wait, this seems impossible. Let's check again. If 9 is the mode, it must appear more than any other number. Let's suppose 9 appears twice. Then the other numbers can appear at most once each. The total sum is 30. Let's see if that's possible.

If 9 appears twice, then the other six numbers must sum to 30 - 2*9 = 12. These six numbers must all be distinct positive integers, each appearing once. The minimum sum for six distinct positive integers is 1+2+3+4+5+6=21, which is greater than 12. Therefore, impossible. Therefore, 9 cannot appear twice. Therefore, 9 must appear at least three times. But as before, 9 appearing three times leaves the remaining five numbers to sum to 3, which is impossible. Therefore, n=8 is invalid.

Based on execution_4.1:
Wait, maybe 9 appears four times. Then the remaining four numbers must sum to 30 - 4*9 = 30 - 36 = -6. Not possible. So n=8 is impossible.

Therefore, n must be 6, but earlier attempts show that n=6 is also impossible. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming 9 appears three times. Let's check again.

If n=6, the sum of six numbers is 30. If 9 appears three times, the remaining three numbers sum to 30 - 27 = 3. But three positive integers summing to 3 must be 1,1,1, which would make the mode 1, contradicting the mode being 9. Alternatively, 1,1,1 is invalid for mode 9. Therefore, n=6 is impossible.

Wait, maybe 9 appears four times. Then the remaining two numbers sum to 30 - 4*9 = 30 - 36 = -6. Not possible.

<Execution_6>
<execution_6.1>
Sum of 10 numbers is 30. Mode is 9, unique. Median is average of 5th and 6th numbers, which must be integer not in the list. Let's try to construct such a list. Let's assume 9 appears five times. Then the remaining five numbers must sum to 30 - 5*9 = 30 - 45 = -15. Not possible. Therefore, 9 must appear at least six times. Then remaining four numbers sum to 30 - 6*9 = 30 - 54 = -24. Not possible. So this approach isn't working.

Alternatively, maybe 9 appears three times. Then remaining seven numbers sum to 30 - 27 = 3. But seven positive integers summing to 3 is impossible. Therefore, n=10 is invalid.

Wait, this seems impossible. Maybe I need to re-examine the problem.

Wait, the problem says the mode is 9, unique, and the median is a positive integer not in the list. The sum is 30. Let's consider another approach. Since the median is not in the list, and the median is an integer, let's denote the median as m. Then, if the list has an even number of elements, say 2k, then m = (a_k + a_{k+1})/2. Since m is not in the list, and m is an integer, a_k and a_{k+1} must be of the same parity, and their average m is not present in the list.

Also, the mode is 9, so 9 must appear more times than any other number. Let's think about possible values for the median. Since the sum is 30, and the median is m, which is an integer not in the list, and the mode is 9, which is unique.

Let me try to find possible m values. Let's consider possible m values such that m is an integer not in the list, and the list has an even number of elements.

Let me try m=5. Then the median is 5, which is not in the list. Then the sum of all elements is 30. The list has 2k elements. Let's assume k=3, so n=6. Then the list has six elements, with median (a_3 + a_4)/2 =5. So a_3 + a_4=10. Since the median is 5, which is not in the list, a_3 and a_4 cannot be 5. So the third and fourth elements sum to 10, but neither is 5. Let's see possible combinations.

Possible pairs for a_3 and a_4: (4,6), (3,7), (2,8), (1,9). But 9 is the mode, so 9 must appear more times than any other number. If 9 appears three times, then other numbers can appear at most two times. Let's consider the list sorted as [a, b, c, d, e, f]. The median is (c + d)/2=5. So c + d=10. Let's suppose c=4 and d=6. Then the list is [a, b, 4, 6, e, f]. The mode is 9, so 9 must appear three times. Let's place three 9s in the list. Since the list is sorted, 9s must be towards the end. So possible positions: e and f could be 9, but since the median is 5, e and f must be ≥6. If e=9 and f=9, then the list is [a, b, 4, 6, 9, 9]. The sum is a + b + 4 + 6 + 9 + 9 = a + b + 28 =30 ⇒ a + b=2. Since a and b are positive integers, a=1 and b=1. So the list is [1,1,4,6,9,9]. But then the mode is 1 and 9, each appearing twice. Not unique. Therefore, invalid.

Alternatively, place one 9 in e or f. Let's try e=9. Then the list is [a, b, 4, 6, 9, f]. The sum is a + b +4 +6 +9 +f= a + b + f +19=30 ⇒ a + b + f=11. To have 9 as mode, 9 must appear at least twice. So f=9. Then a + b +9=11 ⇒ a + b=2. So a=1, b=1. Then the list is [1,1,4,6,9,9]. Again, mode is 1 and 9, each appearing twice. Not unique.

Alternatively, place two 9s. Let's say e=9 and f= something. Wait, but if e=9 and f=9, then the list is [a, b,4,6,9,9], sum a + b=2. As before.

Alternatively, maybe c=3 and d=7. Then the list is [a, b,3,7, e, f]. The sum is a + b +3 +7 + e + f= a + b + e + f +10=30 ⇒ a + b + e + f=20. Since 9 is the mode, at least three 9s. Let's try to place three 9s. The sorted list must be [a, b,3,7,9,9]. Then sum is a + b +3 +7 +9 +9= a + b +28=30 ⇒ a + b=2. Again, a=1, b=1. The list is [1,1,3,7,9,9]. Mode is 1 and 9, each twice. Not unique.

<Plan_7>
Based on execution_6.1:
Alternatively, place one 9 at the end. Let's try [a, b,3,7,9, f]. The sum is a + b +3 +7 +9 +f= a + b + f +13=30 ⇒ a + b + f=17. To have 9 as mode, at least three 9s. But currently, only one 9. So need two more 9s. But the list is sorted, so the last two elements (e and f) must be ≥7. To have two more 9s, e and f would need to be 9. So the list would be [a, b,3,7,9,9]. But then sum is a + b +3 +7 +9 +9= a + b +28=30 ⇒ a + b=2. Again, a=1, b=1. Mode is 1 and 9, each twice. Not unique.

This seems impossible. Let's try a different median. Let's try m=6. Then the median is 6, which is not in the list. Then a_k + a_{k+1}=12. Let's try n=8. Then the list has 8 numbers, median is (4th +5th)/2=6. So 4th +5th=12. The list is [a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h], sorted. The mode is 9, appearing more times than any other. Let's try to construct such a list.

<prompt_7.1> For m=6, construct a list with n=8 elements where the median is 6, the mode is 9, and the sum is 30. </prompt_7.1>
</Plan_7>

<Execution_7>
<execution_7.1>
Let's assume 9 appears three times. Then the other five numbers must sum to 30 - 3*9=3. But five positive integers summing to 3 is impossible. Therefore, 9 must appear more than three times. Wait, but 9 can't appear four times because 4*9=36, which exceeds 30. Therefore, impossible. Therefore, m=6 is invalid.

Next, try m=4. Then a_k + a_{k+1}=8. For example, n=8. The median is (4th +5th)/2=4. So 4th +5th=8. Let's try to construct such a list. The list is [a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h], sorted. Mode is 9, appearing more times than any other. Let's try to have 9 appear three times. Then the remaining five numbers must sum to 30 - 27=3. Again, impossible. Therefore, invalid.

Alternatively, m=5. Then a_k + a_{k+1}=10. Let's try n=6. The list is [a, b, c, d, e, f], sorted. Median is (c + d)/2=5, so c + d=10. Mode is 9, appearing three times. Let's try [1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 9]. Sum is 1+2+4+6+9+9=29. Need sum 30. Adjust one element: [1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 10]. Sum=32. Too high. [1, 2, 4, 5, 9, 9]. Sum=1+2+4+5+9+9=29. Still low. [1, 2, 4, 7, 9, 9]. Sum=1+2+4+7+9+9=32. [1, 2, 3, 7, 9, 9]. Sum=1+2+3+7+9+9=29. Still low. [1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 9]. Sum=1+2+3+8+9+9=32. No good. [1, 2, 2, 8, 9, 9]. Sum=1+2+2+8+9+9=31. Close. But mode is 1,2,9. Invalid. [1, 1, 3, 8, 9, 9]. Sum=1+1+3+8+9+9=31. Still no. [1, 1, 4, 8, 9, 9]. Sum=1+1+4+8+9+9=32. Not helpful.

Alternatively, if 9 appears four times, sum would be 4*9=36, which is over 30. Therefore, impossible. Therefore, m=5 is invalid.

<Plan_8>
Based on execution_7.1:
This is getting too complicated. Maybe there's a different approach. Let me think.

Since the median is not in the list and is an integer, the list must have an even number of elements. Let's assume n=6. Then the median is the average of the 3rd and 4th elements. Let's denote them as c and d. So (c + d)/2 is the median, which is an integer not in the list. Then c + d must be even. Also, the mode is 9, unique. So 9 must appear more times than any other number.

<prompt_8.1> Analyze the constraints for n=6 and the sum of squares of the list elements. </prompt_8.1>
</Plan_8>

<Execution_8>
<execution_8.1>
Let's try to find such a list. Let's assume the list is [a, b, c, d, e, f], sorted. The median is (c + d)/2. Let's suppose c + d=10, so median=5. Then the list is [a, b, 5, 5, e, f], but wait, the median is (5 +5)/2=5, which is in the list. Not allowed. Therefore, c and d must be different. Let's say c=4 and d=6, so median=(4+6)/2=5. Then the list is [a, b, 4, 6, e, f]. The mode is 9, appearing at least three times. Let's place three 9s in the list. Since the list is sorted, 9s must be at the end. So [a, b, 4, 6, 9, 9]. The sum is a + b +4 +6 +9 +9= a + b +28=30 ⇒ a + b=2. So a=1, b=1. The list is [1,1,4,6,9,9]. Mode is 1 and 9, each appearing twice. Not unique. Therefore, invalid.

Alternatively, place two 9s. [a, b, 4, 6, 9, f]. The sum is a + b +4 +6 +9 +f= a + b + f +19=30 ⇒ a + b + f=11. To have 9 as mode, at least three 9s. So need at least three 9s. But in this list, only one 9. Therefore, invalid.

Alternatively, maybe the median is 6. Then c + d=12. Let's try [a, b, 5, 7, e, f]. Sum is a + b +5 +7 +e +f= a + b + e + f +12=30 ⇒ a + b + e + f=18. Mode is 9, appearing three times. Let's place three 9s. [a, b,5,7,9,9]. Sum is a + b +5 +7 +9 +9= a + b +26=30 ⇒ a + b=4. Possible, a=1, b=3. Then the list is [1,3,5,7,9,9]. Mode is 9 (appears twice), and 3 and 1 appear once. But 9 is mode, but it's only appearing twice, while 3 and 1 appear once. So mode is 9, unique. But the median is (5 +7)/2=6, which is not in the list. The sum is 1+3+5+7+9+9=34. Too high. Need sum 30. Therefore, adjust. Let's try a=2, b=2. Then the list is [2,2,5,7,9,9]. Sum=2+2+5+7+9+9=34. Still too high. Need to reduce sum. Maybe lower some numbers. Let's try a=1, b=3. Sum=1+3+5+7+9+9=34. Still high. Maybe lower e and f. But they are 9s. Maybe change the median. Let's try a different median. Let's try median=4. Then c + d=8. Let's try [a, b, 3, 5, e, f]. Sum is a + b +3 +5 +e +f= a + b + e + f +8=30 ⇒ a + b + e + f=22. Mode is 9, appearing three times. Let's place three 9s. [a, b,3,5,9,9]. Sum is a + b +3 +5 +9 +9= a + b +26=30 ⇒ a + b=4. Possible, a=1, b=3. List is [1,3,3,5,9,9]. Mode is 3 and 9, each appearing twice. Not unique. Invalid.

This is getting too time-consuming. Maybe there's a mathematical approach. Let's denote the list as sorted a1 ≤ a2 ≤ ... ≤ an. The median is (am + am+1)/2, which is an integer not in the list. The mode is 9, appearing more times than any other number. Let's denote the number of 9s as k. Since 9 is the mode, k > frequency of any other number. The sum of all elements is 30. Let's denote the sum as S = sum_{i=1}^n ai = 30.

We need to find such a list. Let's consider possible values of n. Since n must be even, let's try n=6 again. Let's assume the list has three 9s. Then the sum of the three 9s is 27. The remaining three numbers must sum to 3. But three positive integers summing to 3 is impossible. Therefore, n=6 is impossible.

n=8: Four 9s sum to 36, which is over 30. Therefore, n=8 is impossible.

n=10: Five 9s sum to 45, which is over 30. Therefore, impossible.

Wait, maybe the number of 9s is less than n/2. Wait, no, the mode must appear more times than any other number. So if there are, say, three 9s, then all other numbers can appear at most two times.

Wait, let's try n=6 with two 9s. Then the remaining four numbers must sum to 30 - 18=12. These four numbers must be distinct positive integers, each appearing once. The minimum sum is 1+2+3+4=10, which is less than 12. So possible. Let's try. The list would be [1,2,3,4,9,9]. Sum is 1+2+3+4+9+9=28. Need sum 30. Add 2 more: maybe [1,2,3,5,9,9]. Sum=1+2+3+5+9+9=29. Still low. [1,2,3,6,9,9]=1+2+3+6+9+9=30. Perfect. Now check conditions:

- Sum is 30. Check.
- Mode is 9, appears twice. Other numbers appear once. So mode is 9, unique. Check.
- Median is average of 3rd and 4th elements: (3 +6)/2=4.5. Not integer. Therefore, invalid.

</Execution_8>

<Plan_9>
Based on execution_8:
Therefore, median is 4.5, which is not in the list. But the median must be an integer. Therefore, invalid.

Alternatively, adjust the list. Let's try [1,2,4,5,9,9]. Sum=1+2+4+5+9+9=30. Median is (4 +5)/2=4.5. Again, not integer. Still invalid.

Alternatively, [1,3,4,5,9,9]. Sum=1+3+4+5+9+9=31. Over. Adjust to [1,2,4,5,9,9]=29. Need one more. Maybe [1,2,4,6,9,9]. Sum=1+2+4+6+9+9=31. Still over. [1,2,3,6,9,9]=29. Need one more. Maybe [1,2,3,7,9,9]. Sum=30. Check median: (3 +7)/2=5, which is not in the list. Mode is 9 (twice), others once. Valid. So the list is [1,2,3,7,9,9]. Sum is 1+2+3+7+9+9=31. Over. Adjust to [1,2,3,7,9,8]. Sum=1+2+3+7+9+8=29. Still low. Maybe [1,2,4,7,9,9]. Sum=1+2+4+7+9+9=32. Over. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the list is [1,2,3,6,9,9]. Sum=29. Add 1 to one element: [1,2,3,7,9,9]. Sum=31. Still over. Not helpful. Maybe there's no solution for n=6. Therefore, the answer might be that there is no such list, but the problem states there is a list. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.

<Plan_10>
Based on execution_9:
Let's try another approach. Let's consider that the sum of squares is asked. Maybe instead of finding the list, we can find the sum of squares using the given conditions. Let me think.

We know that the sum of the list is 30, the mode is 9, unique, and the median is a positive integer not in the list. Let's denote the list as sorted a1 ≤ a2 ≤ ... ≤ an. The median is (am + am+1)/2, which is an integer. Therefore, am + am+1 must be even. Also, this median is not in the list, so it's not equal to any ai.

Since the mode is 9, which appears more times than any other number, 9 must appear at least two times. Wait, no, if the mode appears once, but other numbers also appear once, then it's not unique. Therefore, 9 must appear more times than any other number. So if 9 appears twice, then no other number can appear twice. If 9 appears three times, then no other number can appear three or more times.

Let's assume 9 appears three times. Then the other numbers can appear at most two times. Let's see.

<Execution_10>
<execution_10.1>
Let's try to construct such a list with 9 appearing three times. Let's say the list has six elements. Then 9 appears three times, and the other three numbers must appear once each. The sum of the three 9s is 27. The remaining three numbers must sum to 3. But three positive integers summing to 3 is impossible (1+1+1=3, but duplicates). Therefore, impossible. So n=6 is invalid.

n=8: 9 appears three times, sum of 9s=27. Remaining five numbers must sum to 3. Impossible. Therefore, invalid. n=10: 9 appears three times, sum=27. Remaining seven numbers must sum to 3. Impossible. Therefore, invalid.

Alternatively, 9 appears four times. Then sum of 9s=36, which is over 30. Invalid. Therefore, 9 must appear more than four times, which is impossible. Therefore, contradiction.

<Plan_11>
Based on execution_10.1:
Therefore, maybe there is no such list. But the problem states that such a list exists. Therefore, my reasoning must be wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the mode is 9, but it appears only twice, and all other numbers appear once. Then, the mode is unique. Let's see. For example, list [9,9,1,2,3,4]. Sum=9+9+1+2+3+4=28. Need sum 30. Add 2 more: [9,9,1,2,3,5]. Sum=29. Add 1 more: [9,9,1,2,3,6]. Sum=30. Check conditions:

- Sum=30. Check.
- Mode is 9, appears twice. Other numbers appear once. Unique mode. Check.
- Median is average of 3rd and 4th elements: (1 + 2)/2=1.5. Not integer. Invalid.

Alternatively, [9,9,2,3,4,5]. Sum=9+9+2+3+4+5=32. Over. Adjust. [9,9,1,3,4,5]. Sum=9+9+1+3+4+5=31. Over. [9,9,1,2,4,5]. Sum=9+9+1+2+4+5=29. Under. [9,9,1,2,5,5]. Sum=9+9+1+2+5+5=29. Still under. [9,9,2,2,5,5]. Sum=9+9+2+2+5+5=32. Over. Hmm.

Alternatively, [9,9,3,3,4,5]. Sum=9+9+3+3+4+5=33. Over. Not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the list has nine elements. Let's try n=9. Then, the median is the 5th element. Mode is 9, appears more times. Let's say 9 appears three times. Then, other six numbers must sum to 30 - 27=3. Impossible. Therefore, invalid.

Alternatively, n=10. Mode is 9, appears three times. Other seven numbers sum to 3. Impossible. Therefore, no solution. But the problem states that such a list exists. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my approach.
