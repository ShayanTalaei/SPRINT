<Question>
Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to find the absolute value of log base 2 of (x⁴y³z²), given that x, y, z are positive real numbers satisfying a system of logarithmic equations. The answer needs to be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n. Let me try to work through this step by step.

First, let me write down the given equations to make sure I have them right:

1. log₂(x/(yz)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y/(xz)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z/(xy)) = 1/4

And the goal is to find |log₂(x⁴y³z²)|. Hmm, okay. Since logarithms are involved, maybe I can convert these log equations into exponential form to solve for x, y, z. Let me recall that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a.

So, applying that to each equation:

<prompt_1.1> Convert the given logarithmic equations into their exponential forms as per the above plan. </prompt_1.1>

Wait, let me check if this makes sense. Let me verify by plugging x, y, z back into the original equations.

<prompt_1.2> Verify the solution by plugging the values of x, y, and z back into the original equations as per the above plan. </prompt_1.2>

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this problem without solving for x, y, z individually. Let's see.

1. For the first equation: log₂(x/(yz)) = 1/2 implies that 2^(1/2) = x/(yz). So, x = yz * 2^(1/2).
2. Similarly, the second equation: log₂(y/(xz)) = 1/3 implies 2^(1/3) = y/(xz). Therefore, y = xz * 2^(1/3).
3. The third equation: log₂(z/(xy)) = 1/4 implies 2^(1/4) = z/(xy). Hence, z = xy * 2^(1/4).
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
For equation 1: log₂(x/(yz)) = 1/2. Plugging in x = 2^(1/2), y = 2^(1/3), z = 2^(1/4):

x/(yz) = 2^(1/2) / [2^(1/3) * 2^(1/4)] = 2^(1/2) / 2^(7/12) = 2^(1/2 - 7/12) = 2^(6/12 - 7/12) = 2^(-1/12). But 2^(-1/12) is not equal to 2^(1/2). Wait, that can't be right. Did I do something wrong here?

Wait, hold on. If x = 2^(1/2), y = 2^(1/3), z = 2^(1/4), then x/(yz) = 2^(1/2) / (2^(1/3) * 2^(1/4)) = 2^(1/2) / 2^(7/12) = 2^(1/2 - 7/12) = 2^(6/12 - 7/12) = 2^(-1/12). But according to the first equation, log₂(x/(yz)) should be 1/2, which would mean x/(yz) = 2^(1/2), not 2^(-1/12). Hmm, that's a problem. So my previous solution must be incorrect.
</execution_1.2>

<execution_1.3>
Let's consider the exponents in the final expression: x⁴y³z². If I can express this in terms of the equations given, maybe I can find log₂(x⁴y³z²) directly. Let me think.

The given equations are:

1. log₂(x/(yz)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y/(xz)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z/(xy)) = 1/4

Let me rewrite these equations in exponential form:

1. x/(yz) = 2^(1/2)
2. y/(xz) = 2^(1/3)
3. z/(xy) = 2^(1/4)

So, equation 1: x = 2^(1/2) * yz
Equation 2: y = 2^(1/3) * xz
Equation 3: z = 2^(1/4) * xy

Hmm, if I substitute these equations into each other, maybe I can find expressions for x, y, z in terms of each other. Let me try substituting equation 1 into equation 2.

From equation 1: x = 2^(1/2) * yz

Substitute x into equation 2:

y = 2^(1/3) * (2^(1/2) * yz) * z

Simplify the right side:

y = 2^(1/3) * 2^(1/2) * y * z * z

Combine the exponents of 2:

2^(1/3 + 1/2) = 2^(5/6)

So, y = 2^(5/6) * y * z²

Divide both sides by y (since y is positive and non-zero):

1 = 2^(5/6) * z²

Therefore, z² = 1 / 2^(5/6) = 2^(-5/6)

Take square roots:

z = 2^(-5/12)

Hmm, so z = 2^(-5/12). Let me note that down.

Based on execution_1.1:
Hmm, so now I have three equations with x, y, z expressed in terms of each other. Maybe I can substitute these expressions into each other to solve for one variable. Let me try substituting the expression for y from the second equation into the first equation.

<prompt_2.1> Substitute the expression for y from the second equation into the first equation to solve for x as per the above plan. </prompt_2.1>

Based on execution_1.2:
But according to the first equation, log₂(x/(yz)) should be 1/2, which would mean x/(yz) = 2^(1/2), not 2^(-1/12). So this suggests that my previous solution is incorrect. Hmm, where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in solving for x, y, z. Let me check again.

From the second equation: y = xz * 2^(1/3). Let me substitute this y into the first equation.

First equation: x = yz * 2^(1/2). Substitute y from the second equation:

x = (xz * 2^(1/3)) * z * 2^(1/2)

Simplify the right side:

x = x * z² * 2^(1/3 + 1/2)

Combine the exponents of 2:

1/3 + 1/2 = 2/6 + 3/6 = 5/6

So, x = x * z² * 2^(5/6)

Subtract x from both sides:

0 = x * z² * 2^(5/6) - x

Factor out x:

0 = x (z² * 2^(5/6) - 1)

Since x is positive (given as a positive real number), we can divide both sides by x:

0 = z² * 2^(5/6) - 1

Therefore, z² = 1 / 2^(5/6) = 2^(-5/6)

Taking the square root (and since z is positive):

z = 2^(-5/12)
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Let me start over. Let's write the equations again:

1. x/(yz) = 2^(1/2) => x = yz * 2^(1/2)
2. y/(xz) = 2^(1/3) => y = xz * 2^(1/3)
3. z/(xy) = 2^(1/4) => z = xy * 2^(1/4)

So, substitute equation 1 into equation 2:

y = (yz * 2^(1/2)) * z * 2^(1/3)

Simplify the right-hand side:

y = y * z² * 2^(1/2 + 1/3)

So, y = y * z² * 2^(5/6)

Divide both sides by y (since y ≠ 0):

1 = z² * 2^(5/6)

Therefore, z² = 2^(-5/6)

So, z = 2^(-5/12)

Similarly, substitute z into equation 1:

x = y * 2^(-5/12) * 2^(1/2) = y * 2^(1/2 - 5/12) = y * 2^(6/12 - 5/12) = y * 2^(1/12)

So, x = y * 2^(1/12)

Now, substitute x and z into equation 3:

z = x * y * 2^(1/4)

But z = 2^(-5/12), so:

2^(-5/12) = x * y * 2^(1/4)

But x = y * 2^(1/12), so substitute that in:

2^(-5/12) = (y * 2^(1/12)) * y * 2^(1/4) = y² * 2^(1/12 + 1/4) = y² * 2^(5/12)

Therefore:

y² = 2^(-5/12) / 2^(5/12) = 2^(-10/12) = 2^(-5/6)

So, y² = 2^(-5/6) => y = 2^(-5/12)

Then, since x = y * 2^(1/12), x = 2^(-5/12) * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-4/12) = 2^(-1/3)

Similarly, z = 2^(-5/12)
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
Given x = 2^(1/2), y = 2^(1/3), z = 2^(1/4).

First equation: log₂(x/(yz)) = 1/2.

Compute x/(yz):

x/(yz) = 2^(1/2) / (2^(1/3) * 2^(1/4)) = 2^(1/2) / 2^(7/12) = 2^(1/2 - 7/12) = 2^(6/12 - 7/12) = 2^(-1/12). Then log₂(2^(-1/12)) = -1/12, which is not equal to 1/2. So this is a problem. Clearly, my initial approach is flawed.

Let me check with the third equation:

z/(xy) = 2^(1/4)

Substitute x = 2^(-1/3), y = 2^(-5/12), z = 2^(-5/12):

Left-hand side: z/(xy) = 2^(-5/12) / [2^(-1/3) * 2^(-5/12)] = 2^(-5/12) / [2^(-1/3 - 5/12)] = 2^(-5/12) / [2^(-4/12 - 5/12)] = 2^(-5/12) / 2^(-9/12) = 2^(-5/12 + 9/12) = 2^(4/12) = 2^(1/3)

But according to the third equation, this should be 2^(1/4). Hmm, 2^(1/3) ≠ 2^(1/4). So this is a contradiction. Therefore, my solution is incorrect. What did I do wrong here?

Wait, let's go back step by step. Starting from the equations:

1. x = yz * 2^(1/2)
2. y = xz * 2^(1/3)
3. z = xy * 2^(1/4)

Let me substitute equation 1 into equation 2:

From equation 1: x = yz * 2^(1/2). Substitute into equation 2:

y = (yz * 2^(1/2)) * z * 2^(1/3) = y * z² * 2^(1/2 + 1/3) = y * z² * 2^(5/6)

Divide both sides by y:

1 = z² * 2^(5/6) => z² = 2^(-5/6) => z = 2^(-5/12)

Then, substitute z into equation 1:

x = y * 2^(-5/12) * 2^(1/2) = y * 2^(1/2 - 5/12) = y * 2^(1/12)

So, x = y * 2^(1/12)

Now, substitute x and z into equation 3:

z = xy * 2^(1/4)

Substitute x = y * 2^(1/12) and z = 2^(-5/12):

2^(-5/12) = (y * 2^(1/12)) * y * 2^(1/4) = y² * 2^(1/12 + 1/4) = y² * 2^(5/12)

Therefore:

y² = 2^(-5/12) / 2^(5/12) = 2^(-10/12) = 2^(-5/6) => y = 2^(-5/12)

Then, x = y * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-5/12) * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-4/12) = 2^(-1/3)

So, x = 2^(-1/3), y = 2^(-5/12), z = 2^(-5/12)

But plugging these into the third equation gives z/(xy) = 2^(1/3) instead of 2^(1/4). So there's a mistake here. How come?
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in solving for x and y. Let me check again.

Starting from the three equations:

1. x = yz * 2^(1/2)
2. y = xz * 2^(1/3)
3. z = xy * 2^(1/4)

Let me substitute equation 1 into equation 2.

From equation 1: x = yz * 2^(1/2). Substitute into equation 2:

y = (yz * 2^(1/2)) * z * 2^(1/3) = y * z² * 2^(1/2 + 1/3) = y * z² * 2^(5/6)

Divide both sides by y:

1 = z² * 2^(5/6) => z² = 2^(-5/6) => z = 2^(-5/12)

Then, from equation 1: x = y * z * 2^(1/2) = y * 2^(-5/12) * 2^(1/2) = y * 2^(1/2 - 5/12) = y * 2^(6/12 - 5/12) = y * 2^(1/12). So x = y * 2^(1/12)

Now, substitute x and z into equation 3:

z = x * y * 2^(1/4) => 2^(-5/12) = (y * 2^(1/12)) * y * 2^(1/4) = y² * 2^(1/12 + 1/4) = y² * 2^(5/12)

Thus, y² = 2^(-5/12) / 2^(5/12) = 2^(-10/12) = 2^(-5/6) => y = 2^(-5/12)

Therefore, x = y * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-5/12) * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-4/12) = 2^(-1/3)

But according to equation 3, this should equal 2^(1/4). So there's a contradiction here. That means my solution is incorrect. Hmm, where did I go wrong?

Based on execution_4.1:
Starting over:

1. From equation 1: x = yz * 2^(1/2)
2. From equation 2: y = xz * 2^(1/3)
3. From equation 3: z = xy * 2^(1/4)

Substitute equation 1 into equation 2:

y = (yz * 2^(1/2)) * z * 2^(1/3) = y * z² * 2^(5/6)

Divide by y: 1 = z² * 2^(5/6) => z² = 2^(-5/6) => z = 2^(-5/12)

Then, substitute z into equation 1: x = y * z * 2^(1/2) = y * 2^(-5/12) * 2^(1/2) = y * 2^(1/12)

So x = y * 2^(1/12)

Now, substitute x and z into equation 3:

z = x * y * 2^(1/4) => 2^(-5/12) = (y * 2^(1/12)) * y * 2^(1/4) = y² * 2^(5/12)

So y² = 2^(-5/12) / 2^(5/12) = 2^(-10/12) = 2^(-5/6) => y = 2^(-5/12)

Then x = 2^(-5/12) * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-4/12) = 2^(-1/3)

But when substituting back into equation 3, we get z/(xy) = 2^(1/3) ≠ 2^(1/4). This suggests that there is no solution, but the problem states that x, y, z are positive real numbers satisfying the system. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my approach.

Alternatively, maybe I need to set up the equations differently. Let's consider taking the logarithm of each equation to convert them into linear equations in terms of log x, log y, log z. That might be a more straightforward approach.

Let me denote:

Let a = log₂x, b = log₂y, c = log₂z. Then, the original equations can be rewritten as:

<prompt_5.1> Solve the system of linear equations for a, b, and c as per the above plan. </prompt_5.1>
</Plan_5>

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
1. log₂(x/(yz)) = 1/2 => log₂x - log₂y - log₂z = 1/2 => a - b - c = 1/2
2. log₂(y/(xz)) = 1/3 => log₂y - log₂x - log₂z = 1/3 => b - a - c = 1/3
3. log₂(z/(xy)) = 1/4 => log₂z - log₂x - log₂y = 1/4 => c - a - b = 1/4
</execution_5.1>
</Execution_5>

<Plan_6>
Based on execution_5.1:
Now, we have a system of three linear equations:

1. a - b - c = 1/2
2. -a + b - c = 1/3
3. -a - b + c = 1/4

Let me write these equations neatly:

Equation 1: a - b - c = 1/2

Equation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3

Equation 3: -a - b + c = 1/4

Now, let's solve this system. Let's denote the three equations as Eq1, Eq2, Eq3.

First, let's add Eq1 and Eq2 to eliminate a:

<prompt_6.1> Solve the system of linear equations for a, b, and c as per the above plan. </prompt_6.1>
</Plan_6>

<Execution_6>
<execution_6.1>
Eq1 + Eq2:

(a - b - c) + (-a + b - c) = 1/2 + 1/3

Simplify:

0a + 0b - 2c = 5/6 => -2c = 5/6 => c = -5/12

Wait, c is log₂z, which is a real number, but z is positive real, so c can be negative. So c = -5/12.

Now, substitute c = -5/12 into Eq1 and Eq2 to find a and b.

From Eq1: a - b - (-5/12) = 1/2 => a - b + 5/12 = 1/2 => a - b = 1/2 - 5/12 = 6/12 - 5/12 = 1/12 => a - b = 1/12

From Eq2: -a + b - (-5/12) = 1/3 => -a + b + 5/12 = 1/3 => -a + b = 1/3 - 5/12 = 4/12 - 5/12 = -1/12 => -a + b = -1/12

Now, we have two equations:

1. a - b = 1/12
2. -a + b = -1/12

Let me add these two equations:

(a - b) + (-a + b) = 1/12 + (-1/12)

Simplify:

0a + 0b = 0 => 0 = 0

Hmm, that's not helpful. Let me subtract the second equation from the first:

(a - b) - (-a + b) = 1/12 - (-1/12)

Simplify:

a - b + a - b = 1/12 + 1/12 => 2a - 2b = 2/12 => 2(a - b) = 1/6 => Since we already know a - b = 1/12, then 2*(1/12) = 1/6, which is correct. So this doesn't give new information. Therefore, the system is dependent, and we have to express a and b in terms of each other.

From Eq1: a - b = 1/12 => a = b + 1/12

From Eq2: -a + b = -1/12 => - (b + 1/12) + b = -1/12 => -b -1/12 + b = -1/12 => -1/12 = -1/12. Which is always true. Therefore, the system has infinitely many solutions depending on the value of b.

But we also have Eq3 to use: c - a - b = 1/4. Since we already found c = -5/12, substitute into Eq3:

-5/12 - a - b = 1/4 => -a - b = 1/4 + 5/12 = 3/12 + 5/12 = 8/12 = 2/3 => a + b = -2/3

But from Eq1, we have a = b + 1/12. Substitute into a + b = -2/3:

(b + 1/12) + b = -2/3 => 2b + 1/12 = -2/3 => 2b = -2/3 - 1/12 = (-8/12 - 1/12) = -9/12 = -3/4 => b = (-3/4) / 2 = -3/8

Then, a = b + 1/12 = -3/8 + 1/12 = (-9/24 + 2/24) = -7/24

So, a = -7/24, b = -3/8, c = -5/12

Therefore, log₂x = a = -7/24 => x = 2^(-7/24)

log₂y = b = -3/8 => y = 2^(-3/8)

log₂z = c = -5/12 => z = 2^(-5/12)

Now, let's verify these values in the original equations.

<Plan_7>
Based on execution_6.1:
First equation: log₂(x/(yz)) = 1/2

Compute x/(yz):

x = 2^(-7/24), y = 2^(-3/8), z = 2^(-5/12)

yz = 2^(-3/8) * 2^(-5/12) = 2^(-3/8 -5/12) = 2^(-9/24 -10/24) = 2^(-19/24)

x/(yz) = 2^(-7/24) / 2^(-19/24) = 2^(-7/24 +19/24) = 2^(12/24) = 2^(1/2)

Therefore, log₂(x/(yz)) = 1/2, which matches the first equation.

Second equation: log₂(y/(xz)) = 1/3

Compute y/(xz):

y = 2^(-3/8), x = 2^(-7/24), z = 2^(-5/12)

xz = 2^(-7/24) * 2^(-5/12) = 2^(-7/24 -5/12) = 2^(-7/24 -10/24) = 2^(-17/24)

y/(xz) = 2^(-3/8) / 2^(-17/24) = 2^(-3/8 +17/24) = 2^(-9/24 +17/24) = 2^(8/24) = 2^(1/3)

Therefore, log₂(y/(xz)) = 1/3, which matches the second equation.

Third equation: log₂(z/(xy)) = 1/4

Compute z/(xy):

z = 2^(-5/12), x = 2^(-7/24), y = 2^(-3/8)

xy = 2^(-7/24) * 2^(-3/8) = 2^(-7/24 -9/24) = 2^(-16/24) = 2^(-2/3)

z/(xy) = 2^(-5/12) / 2^(-2/3) = 2^(-5/12 +8/12) = 2^(3/12) = 2^(1/4)

Therefore, log₂(z/(xy)) = 1/4, which matches the third equation.

Finally, let's compute |log₂(x⁴y³z²)|.

First, compute x⁴y³z²:

x⁴ = [2^(-7/24)]⁴ = 2^(-28/24) = 2^(-7/6)

y³ = [2^(-3/8)]³ = 2^(-9/8)

z² = [2^(-5/12)]² = 2^(-10/12) = 2^(-5/6)

Multiply them together:

x⁴y³z² = 2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6) = 2^(-7/6 -9/8 -5/6)

Convert all exponents to 24 denominator:

-7/6 = -28/24

-9/8 = -27/24

-5/6 = -20/24

Total exponent: -28/24 -27/24 -20/24 = (-28 -27 -20)/24 = -75/24 = -25/8

Therefore, x⁴y³z² = 2^(-25/8)

Then, log₂(x⁴y³z²) = log₂(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8

Thus, the absolute value is | -25/8 | = 25/8. Therefore, m = 25, n = 8, so m + n = 33.
