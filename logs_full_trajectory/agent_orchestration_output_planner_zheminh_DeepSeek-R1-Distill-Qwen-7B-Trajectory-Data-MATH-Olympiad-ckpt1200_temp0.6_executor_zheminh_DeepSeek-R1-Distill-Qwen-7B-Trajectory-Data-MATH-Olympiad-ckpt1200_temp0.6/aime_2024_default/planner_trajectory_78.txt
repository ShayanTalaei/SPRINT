</Question>

<think>
<Plan_1>
Okay, let's try to solve this problem step by step. First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly.

We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). These form a triangle OAB. The family F consists of all segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant where P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis. So each segment PQ starts on the x-axis at some point (p, 0) and ends on the y-axis at some point (0, q), such that the distance between P and Q is 1. We need to find a point C on the segment AB (other than A or B) that is not covered by any of these segments PQ from F, except for AB itself. Then, we have to compute OC², which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C, and express it as a reduced fraction p/q, then find p + q.

Hmm, okay. So first, let's visualize this.

<prompt_1.1> Visualize the problem by drawing the coordinate plane, plotting points O, A, and B, and illustrating the family of segments PQ. </prompt_1.1>
-----

But let me think again. Is there another approach?

Alternatively, maybe parametrize the family of lines PQ. Since each PQ is a line with x-intercept (p,0) and y-intercept (0,q), and p² + q² = 1. So the equation of PQ is x/p + y/q = 1. Since p² + q² =1, perhaps we can parametrize p and q in terms of an angle? For example, set p = cosθ, q = sinθ, since cos²θ + sin²θ =1. Then the equation becomes x/cosθ + y/sinθ =1.

<prompt_1.2> Use an alternative parametrization of the family of lines PQ and analyze the intersections with segment AB. </prompt_1.2>
-----

Alternatively, maybe set up equations for the lines PQ and AB and find their intersection. But since AB is part of F, which is a PQ segment with p=1/2, q= sqrt(3)/2, which gives the line x/(1/2) + y/(sqrt(3)/2) =1, which simplifies to 2x + (2y)/sqrt(3) =1, or 2x + (2/sqrt(3)) y =1. Then, the line AB is from (1/2,0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let's write the equation of AB.

<prompt_1.3> Write the equation of line AB and find the coordinates of point C where AB is tangent to the envelope of PQ. </prompt_1.3>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
Points O, A, and B form a right triangle? Let me check. The coordinates are O(0,0), A(1/2, 0), and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So OA is along the x-axis from (0,0) to (1/2, 0), OB is along the y-axis from (0,0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2), and AB connects (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). The length of OA is 1/2, the length of OB is sqrt(3)/2, and the length of AB can be calculated using the distance formula: sqrt[(1/2 - 0)^2 + (0 - sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[(1/4) + (3/4)] = sqrt[1] = 1. Oh, so AB is of length 1. Interesting. So triangle OAB has sides OA = 1/2, OB = sqrt(3)/2, AB = 1.
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
Then the equation becomes x/cosθ + y/sinθ =1. So for each θ, we have a line in the first quadrant with intercepts (cosθ,0) and (0, sinθ), which is a segment PQ with length 1.

Now, we need to find a point C on AB that is not on any such line except AB itself. So, C must lie on AB, but not on any other PQ segment. So, we need to find such a point C where the line AB is the only PQ segment in F that passes through C.

Therefore, the problem reduces to finding a point on AB that is tangent to the envelope of all such lines PQ. Because if the line AB is tangent to the envelope, then there's exactly one line PQ (which is AB itself) passing through C. Any other line PQ would either not pass through C or would intersect AB at two points (if they cross AB), but since AB is part of F, we need to find a point C where AB is the only PQ segment passing through it.

So, the envelope of the family of lines PQ is a curve, and the point C is the point where AB is tangent to this envelope. Therefore, we need to find the envelope of the family of lines x/p + y/q =1 with p² + q² =1, and then find the intersection point of this envelope with AB.
</execution_1.2>

<execution_1.3>
The slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So the equation is y = -sqrt(3)x + b. Plugging in point A (1/2, 0): 0 = -sqrt(3)*(1/2) + b => b = sqrt(3)/2. So the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Now, we need to find the point C on AB such that AB is the only segment PQ in F that passes through C. That is, AB is the tangent to the family F at point C. So, the envelope of the family F is the curve that is tangent to each segment PQ. The point C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope.

Therefore, if we can find the envelope of the family F, then find where the line AB is tangent to this envelope, that point of tangency is the point C we need.
</execution_1.3>
</Execution_1>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Now, the family F consists of segments PQ where P is on the x-axis, Q is on the y-axis, and PQ has length 1. So each PQ is a line segment from (p, 0) to (0, q), with p² + q² = 1. These segments form a family of lines in the first quadrant, each with different intercepts (p, q) such that p² + q² = 1.

Our goal is to find a point C on AB (other than A or B) that is not on any other segment from F. Since AB is itself in F (with p = 1/2, q = sqrt(3)/2), we need to find a point on AB that is not on any other PQ segment from F.

To approach this, maybe we can parametrize the family F and find the envelope of these lines. The envelope would be a curve tangent to each member of the family, and the point where AB is tangent to this envelope would be the unique point C we need.

Based on execution_1.2:
First, let's derive the envelope of the family of lines x/p + y/q =1 with p² + q² =1.

To find the envelope of a family of curves given by F(x, y, p) =0, we can use the method of differentiating F with respect to the parameter p and solving the system of equations F(x, y, p) =0 and dF/dp =0.

<prompt_3.1> Derive the envelope of the family of lines x/p + y/q = 1 with p² + q² = 1 using the method of differentiating with respect to the parameter p. </prompt_3.1>
-----

Based on execution_1.3:
To find the envelope of the family of lines x/p + y/q =1 with p² + q² =1, we can use the following method. Let me recall that the envelope of a family of curves F(x, y, p) =0 is found by solving the system F(x, y, p)=0 and ∂F/∂p=0.

<prompt_3.2> Derive the envelope of the family of lines x/p + y/q = 1 with p² + q² = 1 using the method of differentiating with respect to the parameter p. </prompt_3.2>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
Here, our family of lines is given by x/p + y/q =1, with the constraint p² + q² =1. So we can write F(x, y, p) = x/p + y/(sqrt(1 - p²)) -1 =0, since q = sqrt(1 - p²) (assuming p and q positive, as they are on the axes in the first quadrant). Then, the envelope is found by solving:

1. x/p + y/(sqrt(1 - p²)) -1 =0

2. dF/dp = -x/p² + y*( (1/2)(1 - p²)^(-3/2)*(2p) ) = -x/p² + y*p/( (1 - p²)^(3/2) ) =0

So equation 2 is: -x/p² + y*p / (1 - p²)^(3/2) =0.

Let me write these equations again:

Equation 1: x/p + y/q =1, where q = sqrt(1 - p²).

Equation 2: -x/p² + y p / q³ =0, where q = sqrt(1 - p²).
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
So here, F(x, y, p) = x/p + y/q -1, but since p² + q² =1, we can express q in terms of p as q = sqrt(1 - p²). However, this might complicate things. Alternatively, treat p as a parameter and q as dependent on p via p² + q² =1. So, F(x, y, p) = x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p²) -1. Then, the envelope is found by solving F(x, y, p)=0 and ∂F/∂p=0.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach. Let's consider F(x, y, p) = x/p + y/q -1 =0, with the constraint p² + q² =1. So, we can use Lagrange multipliers or express q in terms of p and substitute.

Let me try substituting q = sqrt(1 - p²) into F(x, y, p):

F(x, y, p) = x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p²) -1 =0.

To find the envelope, we need to differentiate F with respect to p and set it to zero:

dF/dp = -x/p² + y*(1/2)(1 - p²)^(-3/2)*(2p) -0 = -x/p² + y*p/(1 - p²)^(3/2) =0.

So the envelope is given by the system:

1. x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p²) =1
2. -x/p² + y*p/(1 - p²)^(3/2) =0

Let me denote s = sqrt(1 - p²), so s = q. Then, equation 1 becomes x/p + y/s =1, and equation 2 becomes -x/p² + y*p/s³ =0.

Let me rewrite equation 2:

From equation 2: y*p/s³ = x/p² => y = (x/p²)*(s³)/p = x*s³/p³.

But s = sqrt(1 - p²), so s³ = (1 - p²)^(3/2). Therefore, y = x*(1 - p²)^(3/2)/p³.

Now, substitute this expression for y into equation 1:

x/p + [x*(1 - p²)^(3/2)/p³]/s =1.

But s = sqrt(1 - p²), so [x*(1 - p²)^(3/2)/p³]/sqrt(1 - p²) = x*(1 - p²)/p³.

Therefore, equation 1 becomes:

x/p + x*(1 - p²)/p³ =1.

Factor out x:

x[1/p + (1 - p²)/p³] =1.

Combine the terms inside the brackets:

1/p + (1 - p²)/p³ = (p² + 1 - p²)/p³ = 1/p³.

Therefore, x*(1/p³) =1 => x = p³.

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
From equation 2: -x/p² + y*p / (1 - p²)^(3/2) =0 => y*p / (1 - p²)^(3/2) = x/p² => y = x * p³ / (1 - p²)^(3/2).

<prompt_4.1> Solve the system of equations derived from the envelope method to find the envelope of the family of lines. </prompt_4.1>
-----

Based on execution_3.2:
Therefore, for each p, the envelope point has coordinates (x, y) = (p³, p³*(1 - p²)/p³) )= (p³, (1 - p²)).

Wait, let's check that:

<prompt_4.2> Verify the coordinates of the envelope points and find the parametric equations for the envelope. </prompt_4.2>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
So, substitute this expression for y into equation 1:

x/p + [x * p³ / (1 - p²)^(3/2)] / sqrt(1 - p²) =1.

Simplify the second term:

[ x * p³ / (1 - p²)^(3/2) ] / sqrt(1 - p²) = x * p³ / (1 - p²)^(2).

Therefore, equation 1 becomes:

x/p + x * p³ / (1 - p²)^2 =1.

Factor out x:

x [1/p + p³ / (1 - p²)^2] =1.

Let me combine the terms inside the brackets:

1/p + p³ / (1 - p²)^2 = [ (1 - p²)^2 + p^4 ] / [ p(1 - p²)^2 ].

Let's compute the numerator:

(1 - p²)^2 + p^4 = 1 - 2p² + p^4 + p^4 =1 - 2p² + 2p^4.
</execution_4.1>

<execution_4.2>
From above, we have x = p³, and from equation 2, y = x*(1 - p²)/p³ = p³*(1 - p²)/p³ =1 - p². Therefore, the envelope is given parametrically by x = p³, y =1 - p², where p is a parameter between 0 and1 (since p is the x-intercept on the x-axis, which is from 0 to1).

So the parametric equations for the envelope are x = p³, y =1 - p².
</execution_4.2>
</Execution_4>

<Plan_5>
Based on execution_4.1:
So, x [ (1 - 2p² + 2p^4) / (p(1 - p²)^2) ] =1 => x = [ p(1 - p²)^2 ] / (1 - 2p² + 2p^4).

Hmm, this seems complicated. Let me check if I made a mistake in substitution.

Wait, let's verify the steps again.

<prompt_5.1> Verify the substitution and simplification steps to ensure the correctness of the envelope equations. </prompt_5.1>

<execution_5.1>
From equation 2:

- x/p² + y p / (1 - p²)^(3/2) =0 => y = (x/p²) * (1 - p²)^(3/2)/p.

Wait, no. Let's redo equation 2:

From equation 2: -x/p² + y p / (1 - p²)^(3/2) =0 => y p / (1 - p²)^(3/2) = x/p² => y = x * p² / [ p (1 - p²)^(3/2) ) ] = x * p / (1 - p²)^(3/2).

Wait, no. Wait, y = [x/p²] * [ (1 - p²)^(3/2) / p ] = x * (1 - p²)^(3/2) / (p³).

Wait, hold on. Let's do this step by step:

From equation 2:

- x / p² + y * p / (1 - p²)^(3/2) = 0

=> y * p / (1 - p²)^(3/2) = x / p²

=> y = [x / p²] * [ (1 - p²)^(3/2) / p ]

= x * (1 - p²)^(3/2) / p³
</execution_5.1>

<execution_5.2>
So, the envelope is parametrized by x = p³, y =1 - p². Let's denote the envelope as E(p) = (p³, 1 - p²). The line AB has equation y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. So, to find the point of tangency, we need to find a point E(p) = (p³, 1 - p²) that lies on AB, and the tangent to the envelope at E(p) is the line AB.

First, since E(p) lies on AB, substituting into the equation of AB:

1 - p² = -sqrt(3)*p³ + sqrt(3)/2.

So, let's write this equation:

1 - p² + sqrt(3)p³ - sqrt(3)/2 =0.

Let me rearrange:

sqrt(3)p³ - p² + (1 - sqrt(3)/2) =0.

This is a cubic equation in p. Let's denote this as:

sqrt(3)p³ - p² + (1 - sqrt(3)/2) =0.

We need to solve this equation for p in (0,1).

Let me compute the constant term:

1 - sqrt(3)/2 ≈1 -0.8660≈0.1340.

So the equation is approximately sqrt(3)p³ - p² +0.1340≈0.

Let me check p=1/2:

sqrt(3)*(1/8) - (1/4) +0.1340 ≈0.2165 -0.25 +0.1340≈0.1005>0.

At p=1/2, LHS≈0.1005>0.

At p=1/3:

sqrt(3)*(1/27) -1/9 +0.1340≈0.0641 -0.1111 +0.1340≈0.087≈0.087>0.

At p=0.3:

sqrt(3)*(0.027)≈0.0468 -0.09 +0.134≈0.0468 -0.09 +0.134≈0.0908>0.

At p=0.2:

sqrt(3)*(0.008)≈0.0138 -0.04 +0.134≈0.0138 -0.04 +0.134≈0.1078>0.

At p=0.1:

sqrt(3)*(0.001)≈0.0017 -0.01 +0.134≈0.1247>0.

So all these p values give positive results. Maybe the root is at p>1? But p is in (0,1). Wait, but the envelope is defined for p in (0,1), since p is the x-intercept on the x-axis, which ranges from 0 to1. So perhaps there is no solution? But the problem states there is a unique point C. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the parametrization.

Wait, let's re-examine the envelope parametrization. The envelope is parametrized by p, the x-intercept, which ranges from 0 to1. For each p in (0,1), the corresponding envelope point is (p³, 1 - p²). Let's check if this makes sense.

For p approaching 0, x approaches 0, y approaches 1 -0=1. For p approaching1, x approaches1, y approaches1 -1=0. So the envelope starts at (0,1) and ends at (1,0). The envelope is a curve from (0,1) to (1,0). The line AB is from (1/2,0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2≈0.866). So AB is a line from (0.5,0) to (0, ~0.866). The envelope curve goes from (0,1) to (1,0), passing through (0.5, sqrt(3)/2≈0.866). Wait, the point B is (0, sqrt(3)/2≈0.866), which is on the envelope? Let's check: If p= sqrt(3)/2≈0.866, then x=p³≈(0.866)^3≈0.649, y=1 - p²≈1 - (0.866)^2≈1 -0.75≈0.25. So the point (0.649,0.25) is on the envelope, but B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). Wait, B is on the y-axis, so p=0, but y=1 -0=1. So B is not on the envelope. Wait, maybe the envelope is the curve that is tangent to all the segments PQ. So the envelope is a curve that touches each segment PQ at exactly one point, being the tangent point. Then, the line AB is another line that is tangent to the envelope at point C. Therefore, point C is the point where AB touches the envelope.

But according to our previous calculation, the equation sqrt(3)p³ - p² + (1 - sqrt(3)/2)=0 has no solution in p ∈ (0,1). But the problem states that such a point C exists. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the derivation.
</execution_5.2>
</Execution_5>

<Plan_6>
Based on execution_5.2:
Wait, maybe the parametrization is incorrect. Let me check again.

<prompt_6.1> Re-examine the parametrization of the envelope and verify the coordinates. </prompt_6.1>
</Plan_6>

<Execution_6>
<execution_6.1>
The envelope parametrization was derived by solving the system for x and y in terms of p. Let me verify that again.

From equation 1: x/p + y/s =1, where s = sqrt(1 - p²).

From equation 2: -x/p² + y p / s³ =0 => y = (x/p²) * s³ / p = x s³ / p³.

Then, substituting into equation 1: x/p + (x s³ / p³)/s =1 => x/p + x s² / p³ =1.

But s² =1 - p², so:

x/p + x (1 - p²) / p³ = x [1/p + (1 - p²)/p³] = x [ (p² +1 - p²)/p³ ] = x [1/p³] =1 => x = p³.

Then, y = x s³ / p³ = p³ * (1 - p²)^(3/2) / p³ = (1 - p²)^(3/2). Wait, wait! Wait, earlier I thought y =1 - p², but now according to this, y = (1 - p²)^(3/2). That seems inconsistent. Wait, let's check again.

Wait, s = sqrt(1 - p²), so s³ = (1 - p²)^(3/2). Then, y = x s³ / p³. But x = p³, so y = p³ * (1 - p²)^(3/2) / p³ = (1 - p²)^(3/2). Therefore, the parametrization should be x = p³, y = (1 - p²)^(3/2). Wait, but earlier I thought y =1 - p², which is incorrect. That was a mistake.

Therefore, the correct parametrization of the envelope is x = p³, y = (1 - p²)^(3/2). This is different from what I previously thought. Let me verify this.

So, correcting that, the envelope points are (p³, (1 - p²)^(3/2)). Therefore, when p=0, x=0, y=1. When p=1, x=1, y=0. So the envelope is a curve from (0,1) to (1,0). Now, the line AB is from (1/2,0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let's check if this line is tangent to the envelope.

So, we need to find a point (p³, (1 - p²)^(3/2)) that lies on AB and where the tangent to the envelope is the same as the slope of AB.

First, let's write the equation of AB. Points A(1/2,0) and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). The slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 -0)/(0 -1/2) = -sqrt(3). So the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Now, the point C lies on AB, so its coordinates (p³, (1 - p²)^(3/2)) satisfy:

(1 - p²)^(3/2) = -sqrt(3) p³ + sqrt(3)/2.

Additionally, the slope of the tangent to the envelope at point (p³, (1 - p²)^(3/2)) must be equal to the slope of AB, which is -sqrt(3).

To find the slope of the tangent to the envelope, we can parametrize the envelope as x = p³, y = (1 - p²)^(3/2). Then, dy/dx = (dy/dp)/(dx/dp).

Compute dy/dp:

dy/dp = 3(1 - p²)^(1/2)*(-2p) = -6p(1 - p²)^(1/2).

Wait, wait, let's compute it step by step:

y = (1 - p²)^(3/2).

dy/dp = (3/2)(1 - p²)^(1/2)*(-2p) = -3p(1 - p²)^(1/2).

Similarly, dx/dp = 3p².

Therefore, dy/dx = dy/dp / dx/dp = [ -3p(1 - p²)^(1/2) ] / [3p²] = - (1 - p²)^(1/2)/p.

Therefore, the slope of the tangent at point p is -sqrt(1 - p²)/p. We need this to be equal to -sqrt(3). Therefore:

-sqrt(1 - p²)/p = -sqrt(3)

=> sqrt(1 - p²)/p = sqrt(3)

Square both sides:

(1 - p²)/p² = 3

=> 1/p² -1 =3

=>1/p²=4

=>p²=1/4

=>p=1/2 (since p>0).

Therefore, p=1/2. Therefore, the point C is at p=1/2 on the envelope. Therefore, coordinates are:

x = (1/2)^3 =1/8

y = (1 - (1/2)^2)^(3/2) = (1 -1/4)^(3/2) = (3/4)^(3/2) = (3^(3/2))/(4^(3/2)) = (3*sqrt(3))/8.

Therefore, point C is (1/8, 3sqrt(3)/8). Wait, but let's check if this point lies on AB.

The equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Plug in x=1/8:

y = -sqrt(3)*(1/8) + sqrt(3)/2 = (-sqrt(3)/8) + (4sqrt(3)/8) = (3sqrt(3)/8). Which matches the y-coordinate. So yes, point C is indeed on AB.

Therefore, point C is (1/8, 3sqrt(3)/8). Now, we need to compute OC², where O is the origin.

OC² = (1/8)^2 + (3sqrt(3)/8)^2 =1/64 + (27/64) =28/64=7/16.
</execution_6.1>
</Execution_6>

<Plan_7>
Based on execution_6.1:
Wait, 3sqrt(3)/8 squared is 9*3 /64=27/64. Then 1/64 +27/64=28/64=7/16. So OC²=7/16. Therefore, p=7, q=16, p+q=23.
-----

But wait, according to the problem statement, there is a unique point C on AB that does not belong to any segment from F other than AB. However, according to our calculation, the point C is where AB is tangent to the envelope of the family F. But the envelope itself is the set of all points where the segments PQ are tangent. So, if AB is tangent to the envelope at C, then AB touches the envelope only at C, which would mean that AB does not intersect any other segments PQ from F except at C. Therefore, C is the unique point on AB that is not on any other PQ from F. Hence, OC²=7/16, so the answer is 7+16=23.

Wait, but the problem states that OC² is p/q with p and q coprime. 7 and 16 are coprime, so that's correct.

But let me verify once more. The parametrization of the envelope was corrected to x = p³, y = (1 - p²)^(3/2). Then, the slope of the tangent is dy/dx = -sqrt(1 - p²)/p. Setting this equal to AB's slope -sqrt(3) gives p=1/2. Then, coordinates of C are (1/8, 3sqrt(3)/8). Then OC² is indeed (1/8)^2 + (3sqrt(3)/8)^2 =1/64 +27/64=28/64=7/16. So the answer should be 7/16, so p+q=23.

But let me check if there's any mistake here. For example, maybe the parametrization of the envelope is incorrect. Let's re-derive the envelope.

Therefore, the answer is 23.
