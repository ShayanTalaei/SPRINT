</Question>

<think>
<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to find the greatest four-digit number N with the property that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, once I find N, I have to divide it by 1000 to get Q and R, and then add Q and R together. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let's understand the problem. The number N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. The key property is that if I change any single digit of N to 1, the new number must be divisible by 7. Since N is the greatest such number, I need to find the largest possible four-digit number where this condition holds for all four digits.

Let me denote the digits of N as A, B, C, D, where A is the thousands digit, B the hundreds, C the tens, and D the units. So N can be written as 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

Now, if I change any one digit to 1, the resulting number must be divisible by 7. So, changing A to 1 gives 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D. This must be divisible by 7. Similarly, changing B to 1 gives 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D, which must be divisible by 7, and so on for C and D.

So, for each digit position, replacing that digit with 1 results in a number divisible by 7. Therefore, we have four conditions:

1. 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

So, I need to find digits A, B, C, D (each from 0 to 9, with A ≠ 0) such that all four of these congruences hold. Then among all such numbers, find the largest one, which would be the maximum possible N.

Let me note that all four conditions must be satisfied. So, perhaps we can express each equation in terms of N and then find constraints on N.

But maybe it's better to consider each condition separately and see how they constrain the digits.

Let me first compute the values modulo 7 for each of the coefficients.

<prompt_1.1> Compute the values of 1000, 100, 10, and 1 modulo 7. </prompt_1.1>
-----

Alternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way to approach this. Let me think. Since changing any digit to 1 makes the number divisible by 7, perhaps the original number N is congruent to some specific value modulo 7. Let's see.

Let me denote the original number as N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D. When we change the first digit to 1, we get 1000 + 100B + 10C + D.

<prompt_1.2> Use modular arithmetic to find the congruence of N modulo 7. </prompt_1.2>
-----

But let me check if this number is indeed the largest possible.

Suppose we try to make A=9, which is the largest possible. Then we need to find B, C, D such that all four conditions hold.

<prompt_1.3> Check if the number 9991 is valid by changing each digit to 1 and testing divisibility by 7. </prompt_1.3>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
First, let's compute the coefficients modulo 7.

1000 mod 7: Let's divide 1000 by 7. 7*142 = 994, so 1000 - 994 = 6. So 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

100 mod 7: 7*14 = 98, so 100 - 98 = 2. So 100 ≡ 2 mod 7.

10 mod 7: 10 - 7 = 3, so 10 ≡ 3 mod 7.

1 mod 7: 1 mod 7 is 1.
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
This is equal to N - 1000A + 1000. Therefore, N - 1000A + 1000 ≡ 0 mod 7. But since N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D, then N ≡ 1000A + 100B + 10C + D mod 7. So, when we change the first digit to 1, the number becomes 1000 + 100B + 10C + D. Let's compute this modulo 7.

Similarly, when we change the second digit to 1, the number becomes 1000A + 100 + 10C + D, which is N - 100B + 100. Then, modulo 7, this is N - 100B + 100 ≡ 0 mod 7.

Similarly, changing the third digit to 1: N - 10C + 10 ≡ 0 mod 7. Changing the fourth digit to 1: N - D + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, in summary, the four conditions are:

1. N - 1000A + 1000 ≡ 0 mod 7
2. N - 100B + 100 ≡ 0 mod 7
3. N - 10C + 10 ≡ 0 mod 7
4. N - D + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

But since N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D, substituting into each equation:

1. 1000A + 100B + 10C + D - 1000A + 1000 ≡ 0 mod 7 ⇒ 100B + 10C + D + 1000 ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 1000A + 100B + 10C + D - 100B + 100 ≡ 0 mod 7 ⇒ 1000A + 10C + D + 100 ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 1000A + 100B + 10C + D - 10C + 10 ≡ 0 mod 7 ⇒ 1000A + 100B + D + 10 ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + D - D + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7 ⇒ 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7
</execution_1.2>

<execution_1.3>
Let me check if N=9991 works. Let's verify each condition.

First, changing A to 1: 1000 + 999 + 91 (Wait, no. Wait, changing A to 1 gives 1000*1 + 100*9 + 10*9 + 1 = 1000 + 900 + 90 + 1 = 1991. Then 1991 divided by 7: 7*284 = 1988, 1991 - 1988 = 3. So remainder 3. Not divisible by 7. So 9991 is invalid.

So changing the first digit to 1 gives a number not divisible by 7. Therefore, 9991 is invalid. So maybe 9981? Let's check.

Wait, but maybe I need a different approach. Let's consider the differences between the original number and the modified numbers. Let's denote N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D. Then, changing A to 1 gives 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D. The difference between N and this number is (1000A - 1000) = 1000(A - 1). Similarly, changing B to 1 gives 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D. The difference from N is (100B - 100) = 100(B - 1). Similarly for changing C and D.

Since N - modified number = 1000(A - 1), 100(B - 1), 10(C - 1), D - 1. But since the modified number is divisible by 7, N - modified number ≡ N - 0 mod 7. Wait, no. Wait, modified number ≡ 0 mod 7, so N ≡ modified number mod 7. Therefore, N ≡ modified number mod 7. So, N ≡ 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D mod 7, N ≡ 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D mod 7, etc.

But maybe instead of looking at N mod 7, we can look at the differences between N and the modified numbers. For example, N - (modified number where A is 1) = 1000(A - 1). Since the modified number is divisible by 7, then N ≡ 0 mod 7 + 1000(A - 1). Wait, maybe this is getting too convoluted.

Alternatively, let's consider that for each digit position, replacing that digit with 1 gives a number divisible by 7. So, for each digit position, the value of the number when that digit is 1 must be 0 mod 7. Let's denote the original number as N, and the modified numbers as N_A, N_B, N_C, N_D, where each N_X is the number with digit X replaced by 1.

Then, N_A = 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7

N_B = 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7

N_C = 1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D ≡ 0 mod 7

N_D = 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

So, we have four congruences:

1. 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7

2. 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7

3. 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7

4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Let me compute these expressions modulo 7.

First, note that 1000 mod 7: 1000 ÷ 7 is 142*7=994, remainder 6. So 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

Similarly, 100 mod 7: 100 ÷ 7 is 14*7=98, remainder 2. So 100 ≡ 2 mod 7.

10 mod 7 is 3.

1 mod 7 is 1.

So, substituting these into the equations:

1. 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7

2. 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7

3. 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡ 0 mod 7

4. 6A + 2B + 3C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

So now we have four congruences:

2. 6A + 3C + D ≡ -2 mod 7. Since -2 mod 7 is 5, so 6A + 3C + D ≡ 5 mod 7.

3. 6A + 2B + D ≡ -3 mod 7. -3 mod 7 is 4, so 6A + 2B + D ≡ 4 mod 7.

4. 6A + 2B + 3C ≡ -1 mod 7. -1 mod 7 is 6, so 6A + 2B + 3C ≡ 6 mod 7.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
1. If we change the first digit to 1: 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7. But 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7, so 6 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7. Similarly, 100B ≡ 2B mod 7, 10C ≡ 3C mod 7, and D ≡ D mod 7. So, 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7. So that's the first equation.

Similarly, changing the second digit to 1: 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7. 1000A ≡ 6A mod 7, 100 ≡ 2 mod 7, 10C ≡ 3C mod 7, D ≡ D mod 7. So, 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7. Second equation.

Changing the third digit to 1: 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7. 1000A ≡ 6A, 100B ≡ 2B, 10 ≡ 3, D ≡ D. So, 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡ 0 mod 7. Third equation.

Changing the fourth digit to 1: 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7. 1000A ≡ 6A, 100B ≡ 2B, 10C ≡ 3C, 1 ≡ 1. So, 6A + 2B + 3C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7. Fourth equation.

So, the four equations are:

1. 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7 (from changing first digit)
2. 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7 (changing second digit)
3. 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡ 0 mod 7 (changing third digit)
4. 6A + 2B + 3C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7 (changing fourth digit)

Based on execution_2.1:
Now, we have a system of four congruences involving A, B, C, D (each from 0 to 9, with A ≠ 0). Our goal is to find the largest four-digit number N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D that satisfies all four congruences.

Since we need the largest N, we should start by trying the largest possible values for A, then B, then C, and so on, and check if the conditions are satisfied. However, this brute-force approach could be time-consuming. Maybe we can find some relationships between the variables.

Let me look at the four equations again:

</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
Simplify:

6A + 2 - 6 - 2B ≡ 0 mod 7 ⇒ 6A - 2B - 4 ≡ 0 mod 7 ⇒ 6A - 2B ≡ 4 mod 7.

Divide both sides by 2 (since 2 and 7 are coprime, division is allowed):

3A - B ≡ 2 mod 7. So, equation 5: 3A - B ≡ 2 mod 7.

Similarly, subtract equation 2 from equation 3:

(6A + 2B + 3 + D) - (6A + 2 + 3C + D) ≡ 0 mod 7

Simplify:

2B + 3 - 2 - 3C ≡ 0 mod 7 ⇒ 2B - 3C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7. So, equation 6: 2B - 3C ≡ -1 mod 7 ⇒ 2B - 3C ≡ 6 mod 7.

Subtract equation 3 from equation 4:

(6A + 2B + 3C + 1) - (6A + 2B + 3 + D) ≡ 0 mod 7

Simplify:

3C + 1 - 3 - D ≡ 0 mod 7 ⇒ 3C - D - 2 ≡ 0 mod 7 ⇒ 3C - D ≡ 2 mod 7. Equation 7: 3C - D ≡ 2 mod 7.

So now we have three new equations:

5. 3A - B ≡ 2 mod 7

Simplify: 6A - 2B ≡ 4 mod 7.

Divide both sides by 2: 3A - B ≡ 2 mod 7. So, equation 5: 3A - B ≡ 2 mod 7.

Similarly, substitute D into equation 3: 6A + 2B + D ≡ 4 mod 7. D is 1 - 2B - 3C, so:

6A + 2B + (1 - 2B - 3C) ≡ 4 mod 7 ⇒ 6A + 1 - 3C ≡ 4 mod 7 ⇒ 6A - 3C ≡ 3 mod 7. Divide both sides by 3 (since 3 and 7 are coprime):

2A - C ≡ 1 mod 7. So equation 6: 2A - C ≡ 1 mod 7.

Now, substitute D into equation 4: 6A + 2B + 3C ≡ 6 mod 7. D is 1 - 2B - 3C, but we already substituted D into equation 3. Wait, equation 4 is 6A + 2B + 3C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7. Wait, no: equation 4 is 6A + 2B + 3C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7. Wait, no. Wait, original equation 4 is 6A + 2B + 3C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7. So, that's equation 4: 6A + 2B + 3C ≡ -1 mod 7, which is 6 mod 7. So, equation 4 is 6A + 2B + 3C ≡ 6 mod 7.

But we can substitute B from equation 5 and C from equation 6 into this equation. Let's try that.

From equation 5: B ≡ 3A - 2 mod 7.

From equation 6: C ≡ 2A - 1 mod 7.

So, substituting B and C into equation 4:

6A + 2*(3A - 2) + 3*(2A - 1) ≡ 6 mod 7

Let me compute each term:

6A remains 6A.

2*(3A - 2) = 6A - 4.

3*(2A - 1) = 6A - 3.

Adding them up:

6A + (6A - 4) + (6A - 3) = 18A - 7.

So, 18A - 7 ≡ 6 mod 7.

Compute 18A mod 7: 18 ÷ 7 = 2*7=14, remainder 4, so 18 ≡ 4 mod 7. So, 18A ≡ 4A mod 7.

Similarly, -7 ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, 4A ≡ 6 mod 7.

Therefore, 4A ≡ 6 mod 7. Multiply both sides by the inverse of 4 mod 7. The inverse of 4 mod 7 is 2 because 4*2=8≡1 mod7. So, multiplying both sides by 2:

A ≡ 6*2 ≡ 12 ≡ 5 mod 7. So, A ≡ 5 mod 7.

Therefore, A can be 5 or 12, but since A is a digit (0-9), and A is the thousands digit (so A ≥ 1), the possible values for A are 5 and 12. Wait, 12 is not a digit. So, only A=5 is possible. Therefore, A=5.

Wait, but let me check. A is a digit from 1 to 9, so 5 is the only possible value here.
</execution_4.1>

<execution_4.2>
Similarly, from equation 6: 2B - 3C ≡ 6 mod 7. Substitute B from equation 5:

2*(3A - 2) - 3C ≡ 6 mod 7 ⇒ 6A - 4 - 3C ≡ 6 mod 7 ⇒ 6A - 3C ≡ 10 mod 7 ⇒ 6A - 3C ≡ 3 mod 7 (since 10 mod 7 is 3).

Divide both sides by 3: 2A - C ≡ 1 mod 7 (since 3 and 7 are coprime, division is allowed). So, equation 8: 2A - C ≡ 1 mod 7.

From equation 7: 3C - D ≡ 2 mod 7 ⇒ D ≡ 3C - 2 mod 7.

So now, we can express B, C, D in terms of A.

From equation 5: B ≡ 3A - 2 mod 7.

From equation 8: C ≡ 2A - 1 mod 7.

From equation 7: D ≡ 3C - 2 mod 7. Substitute C from equation 8: D ≡ 3*(2A - 1) - 2 mod 7 ⇒ D ≡ 6A - 3 - 2 mod 7 ⇒ D ≡ 6A - 5 mod 7.

<execution_5.1>
6A + 2*(3A - 2) + 3*(2A - 1)

Then, 18A - 7 ≡ 6 mod 7.

18A ≡ 6 + 7 ≡ 13 ≡ 6 mod 7 (since 13 - 7 = 6).

So, 18A ≡ 6 mod 7.

But 18 mod 7 is 4 (since 7*2=14, 18-14=4). So 4A ≡ 6 mod 7.

Solving 4A ≡ 6 mod 7.

Multiply both sides by the inverse of 4 mod 7. The inverse of 4 mod 7 is 2 because 4*2=8≡1 mod7. So:

A ≡ 6*2 ≡ 12 ≡ 5 mod 7.

So A ≡ 5 mod 7. Since A is a digit (1-9), possible values are 5 and 12. But 12 is invalid, so A must be 5.

<execution_5.2>
B ≡ 3A - 2 mod 7

C ≡ 2A - 1 mod 7

D ≡ 6A - 5 mod 7

But since B, C, D must be digits between 0 and 9, we need to find A such that these expressions result in valid digits.

Given that A is a digit from 1 to 9.

But from equation 5, we found that A ≡ 5 mod 7. So A can be 5 or 12, but since A is a digit, A=5.

Wait, but is that correct? Let me verify.

Wait, let's go back. When we substituted B and C into equation 4, we ended up with A ≡ 5 mod 7. So A must be congruent to 5 modulo 7. Since A is a digit from 1 to 9, the possible values are 5 and 12. But 12 is not a digit, so only A=5 is possible.

Therefore, A=5.

Now, substitute A=5 into equations for B, C, D.

From equation 5: B ≡ 3*5 - 2 ≡ 15 - 2 ≡ 13 ≡ 6 mod 7. So B=6.

From equation 6: C ≡ 2*5 - 1 ≡ 10 - 1 ≡ 9 ≡ 2 mod 7. So C=2.

From equation 7: D ≡ 6*5 - 5 ≡ 30 - 5 ≡ 25 ≡ 4 mod 7. So D=4.

But maybe there's a larger number that also satisfies the conditions. For example, could there be a number with A=5, B=6, C=2, D=4, but with higher digits in other places? Wait, but we found that A must be 5. So the thousands digit is fixed at 5.

So the thousands digit is 5. Then, the hundreds digit is 6. Then, the tens digit is 2, and units digit is 4. So 5624.

But is this the largest possible? Let's check.

Wait, but maybe there's a larger number where changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. For example, is 5624 the largest, or could there be a number like 5694, 5724, etc.?

Wait, but according to our earlier deduction, A must be 5. Because from equation 5, A ≡ 5 mod 7, so the only possible digit is 5. So, the thousands digit must be 5. So 5624 is the only candidate. Therefore, 5624 is the answer.

But let me verify this. Let's check each condition.

<prompt_8.1> Verify the solution by checking each condition for the number 5624. </prompt_8.1>

<execution_8.1>
1. Changing the first digit to 1: 1624. 1624 ÷ 7 = 232. So 1624 is divisible by 7. Correct.

2. Changing the second digit to 1: 5124. 5124 ÷ 7 = 732. So divisible by 7. Correct.

3. Changing the third digit to 1: 5614. 5614 ÷ 7 = 802. Correct.

4. Changing the fourth digit to 1: 5621. 5621 ÷ 7 = 803. Correct.

All four conditions are satisfied. Therefore, 5624 is a valid candidate. But is it the largest such number?

Wait, but let's check if there is a larger number. For example, if A=5, B=6, C=2, D=4 is 5624. Is there a number like 5625? Let's check if 5625 would work. But D=5. Let's check the fourth condition: changing D to 1 gives 5621, which is divisible by 7. But changing the third digit to 1 gives 5615. 5615 ÷ 7 = 802.142... which is not an integer. So 5615 is not divisible by 7. Therefore, 5625 is invalid.

Similarly, maybe 5634? Let's see. Let's check if changing each digit to 1 gives a multiple of 7.

But according to our earlier deduction, since A=5 is fixed, and B=6, C=2, D=4, any number with A=5, B=6, C=2, D=4 is the only possible solution. Therefore, 5624 is the only number satisfying all four conditions with A=5. Since A must be 5, there can't be a larger number with A=6 or higher, because our equations forced A=5. Therefore, 5624 is the answer.

But wait, let me check if there's another solution with A=5 but different B, C, D. Wait, according to our earlier equations, once A=5, B, C, D are uniquely determined. So there's only one solution: 5624. Therefore, this must be the answer.

Based on execution_8.1:
But wait, let me check again. The problem says "the greatest four-digit positive integer". So if there's another number with A=5, B=6, C=2, D=4, but with higher digits in other places, but according to our equations, once A=5, B=6, C=2, D=4 are fixed. So there's no higher number. So 5624 is the answer.

But let me check once more. Suppose there's a number like 5624, but with higher digits in other places. For example, 5624 vs 5634. But changing the third digit to 1 would give 5614, which is divisible by 7. But changing the fourth digit to 1 gives 5621, which is divisible by 7. However, if we change the second digit to 1, we get 5124, which is divisible by 7. But if we change the first digit to 1, we get 1624, which is divisible by 7. However, if the number is 5634, changing the third digit to 1 would give 5614, which is divisible by 7, but changing the fourth digit to 1 would give 5621, which is divisible by 7. But changing the first digit to 1 would give 1634. Let's check 1634 ÷ 7. 7*233=1631, 1634-1631=3. So 1634 ≡ 3 mod 7. Not divisible by 7. Therefore, 5634 would not satisfy the first condition. Therefore, numbers with A=5, but other digits higher than 6,2,4 would not satisfy the conditions.

Therefore, 5624 is indeed the largest possible number. Therefore, Q=5624. Then, Q=5624.

Dividing 5624 by 1000 gives Q1=5 and Q2=624. So Q1+R=5+624=629.
