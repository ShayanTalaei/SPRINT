<Question>
Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

Okay, let's see. Jen is playing a lottery where she picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1, 2, 3, ...., 10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the randomly chosen ones, and the grand prize if all four of her numbers are selected. We need to find the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she already won a prize. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm. So this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). Here, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. Since winning the grand prize automatically means she won a prize (because having all four numbers means she has at least two), the intersection A ∩ B is just A. Therefore, P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B).

So I need to compute P(A) and P(B), then divide them.
First, let's compute P(A), the probability of winning the grand prize. This is the probability that all four numbers she picked are the ones chosen. Since the lottery is random, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is C(10,4). Jen picks one specific set of 4 numbers, so there's only 1 favorable outcome. Therefore, P(A) = 1 / C(10,4).

Next, P(B), the probability that she wins a prize, which is at least two numbers matching. This is the probability of having 2, 3, or 4 numbers matching. But since winning the grand prize is already included in winning a prize, maybe it's easier to calculate 1 - P(0 matches) - P(1 match). But let's verify.

<prompt_1.1> Calculate C(10,4) and find P(A) as 1 divided by C(10,4). Then calculate P(B) by subtracting the probabilities of 0 and 1 matches from 1. </prompt_1.1>

But let's verify by calculating directly. The number of ways to have exactly 2 matches: C(4,2) * C(6,2). Because she has 4 numbers, choose 2 to match, and the other 2 numbers must be from the remaining 6 numbers not in her set. Similarly, exactly 3 matches: C(4,3) * C(6,1), and exactly 4 matches: C(4,4) * C(6,0).

<prompt_1.2> Calculate the number of ways for exactly 2, 3, and 4 matches, sum them up, and divide by C(10,4) to get P(B). </prompt_1.2>

But let me think again if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using combinations or hypergeometric distribution.

<prompt_1.3> Discuss alternative approaches to verify the probability calculation and confirm the result. </prompt_1.3>

Alternatively, suppose we think in terms of conditional probability. Given that she has at least two numbers, what's the chance all four are selected.
So the conditional probability is the number of favorable outcomes (only 1, the set she picked) divided by the number of possible outcomes that satisfy the condition (i.e., all subsets of size 4 that intersect her set in at least two elements).

Alternatively probability the probability probability Theorem conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). Here, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. Since winning the grand prize automatically means she won a prize (because having all four numbers means she has at least two), the intersection A ∩ B is just A. Therefore, P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B).

So I need to compute P(A) and P(B), then divide them.
First, let's compute P(A), the probability of winning the grand prize. This is the probability that all four numbers she picked are the ones chosen. Since the lottery is random, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is C(10,4). Jen picks one specific set of 4 numbers, so there's only 1 favorable outcome. Therefore, P(A) = 1 / C(10,4).

Next, P(B), the probability that she wins a prize, which is at least two numbers matching. This is the probability of having 2, 3, or 4 numbers matching. But since winning the grand prize is already included in winning a prize, maybe it's easier to calculate 1 - P(0 matches) - P(1 match). Let's verify.

The total number of possible 4-number combinations is C(10,4). The number of ways to have 0 matches is C(6,4), because she picks 4 numbers, none of which are in her set, so all 4 numbers must come from the remaining 6 numbers. Similarly, the number of ways to have 1 match is C(4,1) * C(6,3), because she picks 1 number from her 4 and 3 numbers from the remaining 6.

Therefore, P(B) = 1 - [C(6,4) + C(4,1)*C(6,3)] / C(10,4).

So the the number total the total number of such subsets is C(10,4) minus the subsets that intersect her set in 0 or 1 elements. Which is exactly what we calculated before.

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Let me compute those values step by step.

First, compute C(10,4). That's 10! / (4! * 6!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So C(10,4) = 210.

Now compute the number of losing combinations for event B (i.e., 0 or 1 matches).

<prompt_2.1> Compute the losing combinations for event B (0 or 1 matches) using C(6,4) and C(4,1)*C(6,3). </prompt_2.1>

Based on execution_1.2:
So plugging in the numbers:

C(6,4) = 15

<prompt_2.2> Compute the number of ways for exactly 2, 3, and 4 matches using combinations and sum them up, then divide by C(10,4) to get P(B). </prompt_2.2>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Starting with 0 matches: C(6,4). The remaining 6 numbers are not in her set, so choosing all 4 numbers from those 6. C(6,4) = 15.

Then 1 match: C(4,1) * C(6,3). Choosing 1 from her 4, and 3 from the remaining 6. C(4,1) = 4, C(6,3) = 20. So 4 * 20 = 80.

Therefore, the total number of losing combinations is 15 + 80 = 95.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
C(4,1)*C(6,3) = 4 * 20 = 80

So total losing combinations: 15 + 80 = 95. Therefore, the number of winning combinations is 210 - 95 = 115. Therefore, P(B) = 115 / 210. Simplify that fraction: divide numerator and denominator by 5, we get 23/42.
</execution_2.2>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.2:
Then P(A) = 1 / 210. Therefore, the conditional probability is (1/210) / (23/42) = (1/210) * (42/23) = (42)/(210*23) = (1)/(5*23) = 1/115.

Wait, hold on. Let me check that again. Because 42 divided by 210 is 1/5, right? So 1/5 divided by 23 is 1/(5*23) = 1/115. So the probability is 1/115. Then m is 1, n is 115, which are coprime. Therefore, m + n = 116.

<prompt_3.1> Simplify the conditional probability calculation again to confirm the result and find m + n. </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
Wait, but let me verify once more. Because in the conditional probability, we have P(A|B) = P(A)/P(B). P(A) is 1/210, P(B) is 23/42. So 1/210 divided by 23/42 is (1/210)*(42/23) = (42)/(210*23) = (1/5)/23 = 1/115. So 1 and 115 are coprime? 115 factors into 5*23, so yes, gcd(1,115)=1. Therefore, m + n = 1 + 115 = 116.
</execution_3.1>
</Execution_3>

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
But wait, the problem says "the probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize". So if she wins the grand prize, she must have won a prize, so the conditional probability is the probability of winning the grand prize divided by the probability of winning a prize.

<prompt_4.1> Reiterate the conditional probability calculation and confirm the final answer. </prompt_4.1>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
Therefore, 1/210 divided by (115/210) = 1/115. So 1/115 is the probability. Therefore, m + n = 1 + 115 = 116.

But wait, let me check once more. Because sometimes in probability questions, especially with combinations, it's easy to miscalculate. Let's verify all steps again.

First, total number of possible lottery draws: C(10,4) = 210. Correct.

Number of ways to have 0 matches: C(6,4) = 15. Correct.

Number of ways to have 1 match: C(4,1)*C(6,3) = 4*20 = 80. Correct.

Total losing combinations: 15 + 80 = 95. Therefore, winning combinations: 210 - 95 = 115. Therefore, P(B) = 115/210 = 23/42. Correct.

Probability of grand prize: 1/210. Therefore, conditional probability: (1/210)/(23/42) = (1/210)*(42/23) = (42)/(210*23) = (1)/(5*23) = 1/115. Yes, that's correct.

Therefore, the answer is 1 + 115 = 116.

<Final_answer>
Thus, the final answer is \boxed{116}.
