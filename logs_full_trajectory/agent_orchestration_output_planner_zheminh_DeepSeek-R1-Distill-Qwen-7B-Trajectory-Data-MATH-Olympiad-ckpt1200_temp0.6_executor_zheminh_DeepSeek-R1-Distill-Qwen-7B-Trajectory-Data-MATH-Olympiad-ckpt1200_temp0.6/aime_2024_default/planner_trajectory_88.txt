<Question>
Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

Okay, so I need to find the difference between the radii of the circles where the torus touches the sphere when it's resting on the outside versus the inside. The torus has a major radius of 6 (the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of revolution) and a minor radius of 3 (the radius of the generating circle). The sphere has a radius of 11. 

First, let me visualize this. When the torus is resting on the outside of the sphere, the center of the sphere is inside the torus, right? Because the torus is a donut shape, so if it's sitting on the outside, the sphere must be inside the hole of the torus. Similarly, when it's resting on the inside of the sphere, the sphere is outside the torus, so the torus is inside the sphere.

Wait, no. Maybe I need to clarify. If the torus is resting on the outside of the sphere, that probably means the torus is outside the sphere, touching it from the outside. But the torus has a major radius of 6 and minor radius 3, so the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the sphere would be 6 - 3 = 3? Hmm, maybe not.

Let me think again.

<prompt_1.1> Clarify the position of the torus relative to the sphere when resting on the outside. </prompt_1.1>

Similarly, when the torus is resting on the inside of the sphere, the center of the sphere would be inside the torus. Wait, but the torus is a surface, so maybe the sphere is enclosing the torus? Hmm, this is confusing. Let me try to approach this mathematically.

The torus can be described in 3D coordinates. The standard parametric equations for a torus are:

<prompt_1.2> Set up the parametric equations for the torus and the sphere, and derive the condition for external tangency. </prompt_1.2>

The torus is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that's 6 units away from the center of the circle. So the center of the generating circle is 6 units away from the axis of revolution. When the torus is resting on the outside of the sphere, the closest point on the torus to the sphere's center would be along the line connecting the centers of the sphere and the torus. Similarly, when resting on the inside, the closest point would be in the opposite direction? Maybe.

Wait, actually, when the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the distance between their centers would be equal to the sum of their radii? But the torus isn't a sphere, so this might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe the distance between the centers is equal to the difference of the major radii? Hmm, not sure.
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
x = (R + r cos θ) cos φ
y = (R + r cos θ) sin φ
z = r sin θ

where R is the major radius (6), r is the minor radius (3), θ and φ are angles parameterizing the surface.

The sphere is centered at the origin with radius 11. So its equation is x² + y² + z² = 11² = 121.

Now, the torus is resting on the outside of the sphere, so the closest point on the torus to the sphere's center (origin) is equal to the sphere's radius minus the distance from the origin to the closest point on the torus. Wait, no. If the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, then the distance from the origin to the closest point on the torus should be equal to the sphere's radius minus the distance from the origin to the center of the torus's generating circle. Wait, maybe I need to model this more carefully.

The center of the generating circle of the torus is at a distance of 6 from the origin. The generating circle itself has radius 3. So the closest point on the torus to the origin would be along the line connecting the origin to the center of the generating circle. That point would be 6 - 3 = 3 units away from the origin. Similarly, the farthest point would be 6 + 3 = 9 units away.

But the sphere has a radius of 11, which is larger than 9, so the sphere is enclosing the torus. Wait, but the problem says "when T rests on the outside of S, it is externally tangent to S along a circle with radius r_i". Hmm, maybe I need to reconsider.

Wait, when the torus rests on the outside of the sphere, does that mean the torus is sitting outside the sphere, touching it from the outside? But the sphere is larger (radius 11) than the torus (which extends up to 9 units from the origin). Wait, but the torus's maximum distance from the origin is 9, which is less than 11, so the sphere encloses the torus. So how can the torus rest on the outside of the sphere?

Alternatively, maybe the torus is placed such that it is externally tangent to the sphere. So the sphere is inside the torus? But the torus is a surface, so maybe the sphere is tangent to the torus at some points. 

Alternatively, perhaps the torus is placed such that its center is at a distance of 6 from the origin, and then the sphere is tangent to the torus. So the distance between the centers (the origin and the center of the torus's generating circle) is 6. The sphere has radius 11, and the torus has a generating circle radius of 3. So when the torus is tangent to the sphere, the distance from the origin to the torus's surface should be equal to 11.

Wait, the torus is a surface, so the distance from the origin to any point on the torus can be calculated. The minimum distance from the origin to the torus would be 6 - 3 = 3, and the maximum distance is 6 + 3 = 9. But the sphere has a radius of 11, which is larger than 9, so the sphere doesn't reach the torus. Therefore, the torus must be outside the sphere, and the sphere is inside the torus? But that doesn't make sense because the torus's entire surface is within 3 to 9 units from the origin, and the sphere extends to 11 units. 

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the torus is not centered at the origin. Wait, the problem says "when T rests on the outside of S", so maybe the torus is resting on the sphere such that the sphere is inside the torus, and they are tangent. But how? The torus is a surface; maybe the sphere is tangent to the torus at some points.

Alternatively, perhaps the torus is positioned such that it is externally tangent to the sphere. So the sphere is outside the torus, and they touch at a circle. Similarly, when the torus is resting on the inside of the sphere, it is inside the sphere, touching it at another circle. Then the difference in radii of these two circles is to be found.

But how do we model this?

Let me try to model the torus and the sphere. Let's assume that the center of the torus's generating circle is at a point 6 units away from the center of the sphere. The sphere is centered at the origin, and the torus is centered along the x-axis, say. So the center of the generating circle of the torus is at (6, 0, 0). Then the torus is generated by rotating a circle of radius 3 around the z-axis (since the generating circle is in the plane of the torus's axis). Wait, no. If the torus is generated by revolving a circle in the plane of the torus's axis, then the major radius is 6, and the minor radius is 3. So the center of the generating circle is at (6, 0, 0), and the circle is in the plane perpendicular to the z-axis (assuming the axis of revolution is the z-axis). Wait, maybe I need to adjust the coordinate system.

Alternatively, let's set up coordinates such that the sphere is centered at the origin, and the torus is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around the z-axis, which is at a distance of 6 from the origin. So the center of the generating circle is at (6, 0, 0), and the circle is in the plane x = 6, with radius 3. Then, when we revolve this circle around the z-axis, we get the torus. So any point on the torus can be parameterized as:
</execution_1.2>
</Execution_1>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.2:
x = (6 + 3 cos θ) cos φ
y = (6 + 3 cos θ) sin φ
z = 3 sin θ

where θ is the angle in the plane of the generating circle, and φ is the angle around the z-axis.

Now, the sphere is x² + y² + z² = 11² = 121.

We need to find the points where the torus is tangent to the sphere. The tangency condition is that the distance from the origin to the point on the torus is equal to 11, and the gradient (normal vector) of the torus at that point is colinear with the position vector of the point. So, the point lies on both the torus and the sphere, and the normals are parallel.

<prompt_2.1> Derive the condition for tangency between the torus and the sphere using the parametric equations and gradients. </prompt_2.1>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Alternatively, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers to find the points where the torus and sphere intersect with a common normal vector.

But maybe there's a simpler way. Let's consider the cross-section in the x-z plane. The torus can be represented as (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + z^2 = 3^2. Since we are looking for points of tangency, we can set up the equation of the torus and the sphere and solve for their intersection.

But maybe using the parametric equations is better. Let's substitute the parametric equations of the torus into the sphere's equation:

[(6 + 3 cos θ) cos φ]^2 + [(6 + 3 cos θ) sin φ]^2 + [3 sin θ]^2 = 121

Simplify the first two terms:

(6 + 3 cos θ)^2 (cos² φ + sin² φ) + 9 sin² θ = 121

Since cos² φ + sin² φ = 1:

(6 + 3 cos θ)^2 + 9 sin² θ = 121

Expand (6 + 3 cos θ)^2:

36 + 36 cos θ + 9 cos² θ + 9 sin² θ = 121

Combine terms:

36 + 36 cos θ + 9 (cos² θ + sin² θ) = 121

Since cos² θ + sin² θ = 1:

36 + 36 cos θ + 9 = 121

Combine constants:

45 + 36 cos θ = 121

Subtract 45:

36 cos θ = 76

Divide by 36:

cos θ = 76 / 36 = 19 / 9 ≈ 2.111

Wait, that can't be right because cosine cannot exceed 1. That suggests a contradiction. So, where did I go wrong?

Wait, this result is impossible, so maybe my parametrization is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the torus is not parameterized correctly.

Based on execution_2.1:
Wait, maybe I messed up the coordinate system. Let me re-examine the parametrization.

<prompt_3.1> Re-examine the coordinate system and parameterization of the torus to correct the previous mistake. </prompt_3.1>

Now, substituting into the sphere equation:

(6 + 3 cos θ)^2 + (3 sin θ)^2 = 121

<prompt_3.2> Substitute the corrected parametric equations into the sphere's equation and simplify. </prompt_3.2>

36 + 36 cos θ + 9 cos² θ + 9 sin² θ = 121

<execution_3.1>
The torus is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from the center of the circle. So the center of the generating circle is at (6, 0, 0), and the circle is in the plane z = 0, right? Wait, no. If the axis of revolution is the z-axis, then the generating circle is in the plane x = 6, with radius 3. So the parametric equations would be:

x = 6 + 3 cos θ
y = 3 sin θ
z = 0

But that's just a circle in the plane z = 0. Then, when we revolve this circle around the z-axis, the parametric equations become:

x = (6 + 3 cos θ) cos φ
y = (6 + 3 cos θ) sin φ
z = 3 sin θ

Yes, that's correct. So substituting into the sphere's equation:

[(6 + 3 cos θ) cos φ]^2 + [(6 + 3 cos θ) sin φ]^2 + [3 sin θ]^2 = 121

Which simplifies to:

(6 + 3 cos θ)^2 + 9 sin² θ = 121

So expanding (6 + 3 cos θ)^2:

36 + 36 cos θ + 9 cos² θ + 9 sin² θ = 121

Combine terms:

36 + 36 cos θ + 9 (cos² θ + sin² θ) = 121

Since cos² θ + sin² θ = 1:

36 + 36 cos θ + 9 = 121

So 45 + 36 cos θ = 121
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
Wait, no. Wait, the parametric equations are:

x = (6 + 3 cos θ) cos φ
y = (6 + 3 cos θ) sin φ
z = 3 sin θ

So, when we substitute into x² + y² + z² = 121:

[(6 + 3 cos θ) cos φ]^2 + [(6 + 3 cos θ) sin φ]^2 + [3 sin θ]^2 = 121

Simplify:

(6 + 3 cos θ)^2 (cos² φ + sin² φ) + 9 sin² θ = 121

Since cos² φ + sin² φ = 1:

(6 + 3 cos θ)^2 + 9 sin² θ = 121

Expanding (6 + 3 cos θ)^2:

36 + 36 cos θ + 9 cos² θ + 9 sin² θ = 121

Combine terms:

36 + 36 cos θ + 9 (cos² θ + sin² θ) = 121

Since cos² θ + sin² θ = 1:

36 + 36 cos θ + 9 = 121

Adding constants:

45 + 36 cos θ = 121

Subtract 45:

36 cos θ = 76

Then cos θ = 76 / 36 = 19 / 9 ≈ 2.111
</execution_3.2>

<execution_3.3>
36 + 36 cos θ + 9 (cos² θ + sin² θ) = 121

36 + 36 cos θ + 9 = 121

45 + 36 cos θ = 121

36 cos θ = 76

cos θ = 76 / 36 = 19 / 9 ≈ 2.111

But this is impossible because cosine can't be more than 1. So this suggests that there's no solution, which contradicts the problem statement that there is a tangent point. Therefore, my parametrization must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps the parametrization of the torus is incorrect. Let me check.

Wait, the standard parametrization of a torus is:

x = (R + r cos θ) cos φ

y = (R + r cos θ) sin φ

z = r sin θ

where R is the major radius (distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of revolution), and r is the minor radius (radius of the generating circle). So in this case, R = 6, r = 3. So the parametrization is correct.

Then substituting into the sphere's equation gives:

(6 + 3 cos θ)^2 + (3 sin θ)^2 = 121

But expanding this gives 36 + 36 cos θ + 9 cos² θ + 9 sin² θ = 121

Which simplifies to 36 + 36 cos θ + 9 (cos² θ + sin² θ) = 121

Which becomes 45 + 36 cos θ = 121

So 36 cos θ = 76 => cos θ = 76 / 36 = 19 / 9, which is greater than 1. This is impossible. Therefore, there's a mistake here.

Wait, maybe the problem is that when the torus is resting on the outside of the sphere, the center of the generating circle is not at 6 units from the origin. Wait, the problem says "when T rests on the outside of S", so perhaps the distance between the centers of the torus and the sphere is such that the torus touches the sphere. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the sphere is inside the torus, so the torus encloses the sphere? But the torus's maximum distance from the origin is 6 + 3 = 9, which is less than 11, so the sphere can't be inside the torus. Therefore, maybe the problem is that the torus is placed such that it is externally tangent to the sphere. But in that case, the distance between the centers would be 11 - 9 = 2? Wait, no. The sphere has radius 11, the torus has a major radius of 6 and minor radius 3. The maximum distance from the origin to the torus is 9, so if the sphere has radius 11, then the sphere extends to 11 units. So the sphere must be outside the torus, and the torus is placed such that it is tangent to the sphere. But how?

Wait, perhaps the distance from the origin to the center of the torus's generating circle is 6, and the sphere is centered at the origin with radius 11. Then, the torus is placed such that the closest point on the torus to the origin is 6 - 3 = 3 units away, but the sphere is at radius 11, which is much larger. So the sphere is outside the torus. Therefore, the torus cannot be tangent to the sphere unless the sphere is somehow intersecting the torus. But the problem states that they are tangent, so there must be a point where the torus touches the sphere. 

Wait, maybe the problem is that the torus is placed such that it is externally tangent to the sphere, meaning the sphere is outside the torus, and they touch at a single point. Similarly, when the torus is placed inside the sphere, it is internally tangent. But how can the torus be inside the sphere? The sphere has radius 11, and the torus extends up to 9 units from the origin, so the sphere is definitely enclosing the torus. Therefore, the torus cannot be inside the sphere unless it's somehow shifted. 

Wait, perhaps the torus is not centered at the origin. Wait, the problem says "when T rests on the outside of S", so maybe the torus is resting on the sphere's surface, touching it at a point. Similarly, when it's resting on the inside, it's touching the sphere on the inside. But how is that possible if the sphere is larger?

Alternatively, maybe the torus is not centered at the origin. Wait, the problem doesn't specify where the torus is placed. It just says "when T rests on the outside of S", so perhaps the torus is placed such that the sphere is tangent to the torus at a point. 

Wait, maybe the distance between the centers of the torus and the sphere is such that the closest point on the torus to the sphere's center is equal to 11. So the distance from the origin to the closest point on the torus is 11. Since the closest point on the torus to the origin is 6 - 3 = 3, which is less than 11, so that can't be. Therefore, maybe the torus is placed such that the sphere is tangent to the torus at a point where the torus is further away. But the maximum distance from the origin to the torus is 9, which is less than 11, so the sphere can't reach the torus. Therefore, this seems impossible. 

Wait, perhaps I need to reconsider the problem statement. It says "when T rests on the outside of S", meaning the torus is placed outside the sphere, touching it. But the torus's maximum distance from the origin is 9, which is less than 11, so the sphere is larger. Therefore, the torus cannot be outside the sphere and touching it. Similarly, when it's resting on the inside, it's inside the sphere. Therefore, maybe the problem is that the torus is placed such that it is externally tangent to the sphere when it's on the outside (i.e., touching the sphere from the outside), and internally tangent when it's on the inside (touching from the inside). But given the sizes, this seems impossible. 

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the torus is not centered at the origin. Maybe the center of the torus is at a distance such that the sphere can be tangent to it. Let me think. If the torus is centered at a point away from the origin, then the distance from the origin to the torus's center would be such that the sphere can be tangent. 

Let me assume that the torus is placed such that the sphere is tangent to it. Let's denote the center of the torus's generating circle as point C. The distance from C to the origin is d. The torus's generating circle has radius 3, and the sphere has radius 11. When the torus is tangent to the sphere externally, the distance between the origin and the closest point on the torus would be 11. Similarly, when it's tangent internally, the distance from the origin to the farthest point on the torus would be 11.

Wait, but the torus's closest point to the origin would be when the generating circle is closest to the origin. If the center of the generating circle is at distance d from the origin, then the closest point on the torus to the origin would be d - 3, and the farthest point would be d + 3. For the sphere to be tangent externally, the closest point on the torus to the origin must be equal to the sphere's radius, 11. So d - 3 = 11 => d = 14. Similarly, for internal tangency, the farthest point on the torus would be d + 3 = 11 => d = 8. 

But wait, the torus's generating circle is at a distance of 6 from the axis of revolution. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me clarify.

The problem says "Torus T is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius 3 around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance 6 from the center of the circle". So the major radius R is 6, and the minor radius r is 3. The axis of revolution is a line in the plane of the circle, at a distance of 6 from the center of the circle. Therefore, the center of the generating circle is at a distance of 6 from the axis of revolution. When we revolve this circle around the axis, the major radius of the torus is 6, and the minor radius is 3. 

So the torus has a major radius R = 6 and minor radius r = 3. The distance from the center of the torus (the center of the generating circle) to the origin (since the sphere is centered at the origin) is variable depending on how the torus is positioned. 

But the problem states that the torus is resting on the outside or inside of the sphere. So when resting on the outside, the torus is placed such that it is touching the sphere externally. Similarly for the inside. 

So, to compute the radii r_i and r_o of the circles where the torus is tangent to the sphere, we need to find the radii of the circles formed by the intersection of the sphere with the torus when they are tangent.

The key idea is that when the torus is tangent to the sphere, there is exactly one point of intersection (in the case of external tangency) or a circle of intersection (for the circles along which the torus touches the sphere). Wait, but the problem says "along a circle with radius r_i". So the intersection is a circle, meaning that the sphere and torus intersect along a circle of radius r_i. 

Wait, but how can a sphere and a torus intersect along a circle? The intersection of a sphere and a torus is generally a more complicated curve, but in some cases, it can be a circle. For example, if the sphere is centered along the axis of the torus, the intersection might be a circle. 

But in our case, the sphere is centered at the origin, and the torus is generated by revolving a circle around an axis that is 6 units away from the center of the generating circle. If we assume that the axis of revolution is the z-axis, then the generating circle is in the plane x = 6, rotated around the z-axis. Therefore, the torus is symmetric around the z-axis. If the sphere is also centered at the origin, then the intersection between the sphere and the torus would be a circle in the plane perpendicular to the z-axis. 

Wait, but how? Let me think. If the torus is generated by revolving a circle around the z-axis, then the equation of the torus in cylindrical coordinates (ρ, φ, z) would be (ρ - 6)^2 + z^2 = 9. The sphere is ρ² + z² = 121. 

So solving these two equations:

From the torus: (ρ - 6)^2 + z^2 = 9

From the sphere: ρ² + z^2 = 121

Subtract the torus equation from the sphere equation:

ρ² + z^2 - [(ρ - 6)^2 + z^2] = 121 - 9

Simplify:

ρ² - (ρ² - 12ρ + 36) = 112

12ρ - 36 = 112

12ρ = 148

ρ = 148 / 12 = 37 / 3 ≈ 12.333

But ρ is the radial distance in cylindrical coordinates, so ρ = 37/3. Then, substituting back into the sphere equation:

(37/3)^2 + z^2 = 121

z^2 = 121 - (1369 / 9) = (1089 - 1369) / 9 = (-280) / 9

Which is negative, so no solution. This suggests that there is no intersection between the sphere and the torus. But the problem states that they are tangent along a circle, so there must be a mistake here.

Wait, this is confusing. Maybe the torus is not centered at the origin. Wait, the torus is generated by revolving a circle in the plane of the torus's axis. So if the axis of revolution is at a distance of 6 from the center of the generating circle, then the center of the generating circle is at (6, 0, 0) in cylindrical coordinates. Therefore, the torus is offset along the x-axis. 

So the equation of the torus in Cartesian coordinates is:

sqrt((sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + z^2) = 3

Squaring both sides:

(sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + z^2 = 9

Expanding:

x^2 + y^2 - 12 sqrt(x^2 + y^2) + 36 + z^2 = 9

Which simplifies to:

x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 12 sqrt(x^2 + y^2) + 27 = 0

But the sphere is x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121. Substitute this into the torus equation:

121 - 12 sqrt(x^2 + y^2) + 27 = 0

So:

148 - 12 sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = 0

12 sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = 148

sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = 148 / 12 = 37 / 3 ≈ 12.333

Therefore, x^2 + y^2 = (37/3)^2 ≈ 151.111

But since the sphere has radius 11, x^2 + y^2 can be at most 121, so this is impossible. Therefore, the sphere and torus do not intersect at all. But the problem states that they are tangent along a circle, so this can't be right. 

This suggests that there's a misunderstanding in the problem setup. Maybe the torus is not generated by revolving a circle in the plane of the axis, but rather the axis is in the plane of the circle, but at a distance of 6 from the center. Wait, the problem says "revolving a circle with radius 3 around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance 6 from the center of the circle". So the circle is in the plane of the axis, which is a distance 6 from the center. So the axis is in the plane of the circle, which is perpendicular to the original plane. Wait, maybe the axis is in the same plane as the circle, but 6 units away from the center. 

Wait, this is getting too convoluted. Let me try a different approach. 

Alternatively, perhaps the torus is placed such that the center of the generating circle is at a distance of 6 from the origin, and the torus is oriented such that the axis of revolution is along the z-axis. Then, the torus's closest point to the origin is 6 - 3 = 3, and the farthest is 6 + 3 = 9. But the sphere has radius 11, so the sphere is outside the torus. Therefore, the torus cannot be tangent to the sphere externally or internally. 

But the problem states that the torus is resting on the outside of the sphere, meaning it's touching it externally. Similarly, when it's resting on the inside, it's touching the sphere internally. This seems impossible with the given dimensions. Therefore, perhaps the problem is using a different definition of torus or there's a misunderstanding in the setup. 

Wait, maybe the torus is not generated by revolving a circle in the plane of the axis, but rather the axis is in the plane of the circle, meaning the axis is in the same plane as the circle, but at a distance of 6 from the center. So the circle is in 3D space, and the axis is in the same plane as the circle, 6 units away from the center. Then, revolving the circle around the axis would create a torus. 

But perhaps the key is to model the torus and sphere in such a way that they are tangent. Let me consider the equations again. 

The torus equation in cylindrical coordinates is:

(ρ - R)^2 + z^2 = r^2

where R is the major radius (distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis), and r is the minor radius. Here, R = 6, r = 3. So the equation is:

(ρ - 6)^2 + z^2 = 9

The the sphere is:

ρ^2 + z^2 = 121

Subtract the torus equation from the sphere equation:

ρ^2 + z^2 - [(ρ - 6)^2 + z^2] = 121 - 9

Simplify:

ρ^2 - (ρ^2 - 12ρ + 36) = 112

12ρ - 36 = 112

12ρ = 148

ρ = 148 / 12 = 37/3 ≈ 12.333

But then substituting back into the sphere equation:

(37/3)^2 + z^2 = 121

(1369/9) + z^2 = 121

z^2 = 121 - 1369/9 = (1089 - 1369)/9 = (-280)/9

Which is negative, so no solution. Therefore, there's no intersection, which contradicts the problem statement. 

This suggests that either the problem is incorrectly stated, or I'm misunderstanding the configuration. 

Wait, perhaps the torus is not generated by revolving the circle around an axis in the same plane, but rather the axis is in a different plane. Wait, the problem says "revolving a circle with radius 3 around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance 6 from the center of the circle". So the axis is in the plane of the circle, which is 6 units away from the center. So if the circle is in the xy-plane, the axis is in the xy-plane, 6 units from the center. So when you revolve the circle around the axis, the torus is formed in 3D. 

But regardless of the orientation, the equations would still result in no intersection with the sphere. Therefore, the problem must have a different interpretation. 

Alternatively, perhaps the sphere is not centered at the origin? Wait, the problem states that the sphere has a radius 11, but it doesn't specify the center. If the sphere is not centered at the origin, then the distance between the centers of the torus and the sphere would affect the intersection. 

Wait, but the problem says "when T rests on the outside of S", which implies that the sphere is fixed, and the torus is placed such that it is externally tangent to the sphere. Similarly, when resting on the inside, it's internally tangent. Therefore, the sphere must be positioned such that the torus can be tangent to it both externally and internally. 

Assuming the sphere is centered at the origin, then the torus cannot be tangent to it externally because the torus's maximum distance from the origin is 9, which is less than the sphere's radius 11. Therefore, this seems impossible. 

Alternatively, maybe the sphere is not centered at the origin, but the problem doesn't specify. Wait, the problem says "the sphere has a radius of 11", but doesn't mention its position. However, since the torus is generated by revolving a circle in the plane of the axis, which is 6 units from the center of the circle, perhaps the sphere is centered at the origin, and the torus is placed such that its closest point to the origin is at a distance of 11. 

But the closest point on the torus to the origin would be along the axis of revolution. Wait, the torus is symmetric around the axis, so the closest point to the origin would be along the axis. Wait, the axis is a line in the plane of the circle, 6 units from the center of the circle. If the axis is, say, the z-axis, then the closest point on the torus to the origin would be along the axis. 

Wait, no. If the torus is generated by revolving a circle around the z-axis, which is 6 units away from the center of the circle, then the center of the generating circle is at (6, 0, 0). The torus's closest point to the origin would then be the point on the torus closest to (0, 0, 0). The distance from the origin to the center of the generating circle is 6, and the generating circle has radius 3. Therefore, the closest point on the torus to the origin would be 6 - 3 = 3 units away. The farthest point would be 6 + 3 = 9 units away. 

But the sphere has radius 11, so the sphere's surface is at 11 units. Therefore, the torus is entirely inside the sphere, and the closest point on the torus to the origin is 3, which is much closer than the sphere's surface. Therefore, the sphere cannot be tangent to the torus from the outside. 

This suggests that the problem's configuration is impossible as stated, which contradicts the problem's setup. Therefore, I must have misunderstood the problem. 

Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to the torus as a donut shape, but when resting on the outside, it's like the sphere is inside the torus, and when resting on the inside, the sphere is outside the torus. But how? 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the sphere as the one that is being rested on by the torus, but that's not what the problem states. The problem says the torus rests on the sphere. 

Alternatively, maybe the sphere is placed such that the torus is externally tangent to it. For example, the torus is outside the sphere, touching it at a single point. But given that the torus's closest point is 3 units from the origin, and the sphere's radius is 11, this would require the torus to extend outward to 11 units from the origin. 

Wait, but the torus's maximum distance from the origin is 6 + 3 = 9, which is less than 11. Therefore, the sphere is entirely outside the torus, and the torus cannot reach the sphere's surface. 

This is very confusing. Maybe the problem is using a different definition of the torus, where the major radius is smaller. Wait, no. The problem states the major radius is 6, minor radius 3. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different coordinate system. Let me try to visualize this again. 

Imagine the torus is formed by revolving a circle of radius 3 around the z-axis, which is 6 units away from the center of the circle. So the center of the generating circle is at (6, 0, 0). The sphere is centered at the origin with radius 11. The closest point on the torus to the origin is along the line connecting the origin to the center of the generating circle. That point would be (6 - 3, 0, 0) = (3, 0, 0), which is 3 units from the origin. The farthest point is (6 + 3, 0, 0) = (9, 0, 0), which is 9 units from the origin. 

But the sphere has radius 11, so the sphere's surface is at 11 units. Therefore, the torus is entirely inside the sphere, and the sphere's surface is much farther away. Therefore, the sphere cannot be tangent to the torus. 

This suggests that the problem is impossible as stated. However, since the problem asks for r_i - r_o = m/n, there must be a solution. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my reasoning. 

Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to the torus as a surface that is tangent to the sphere along a circle, not that the sphere's surface is tangent to the torus's surface. Maybe the sphere intersects the torus along a circle, which is the case when the sphere and torus are tangent along a circle. 

But as we saw earlier, when trying to solve the equations, there was no solution. But maybe the sphere is not centered at the origin. Wait, the problem doesn't specify the center of the sphere, only its radius. Therefore, perhaps the sphere is placed such that it is tangent to the torus along a circle. 

Let me assume that the sphere is tangent to the torus along a circle. The sphere has radius 11, and the torus has major radius 6, minor radius 3. Let's assume the sphere is centered at some point, and the torus is centered along the axis. 

Wait, but the problem states that the torus is resting on the outside of the sphere, so the sphere is on the inside, and the torus is on the outside. Therefore, the sphere's center must be positioned such that the torus's closest point is at the sphere's surface. 

Wait, if the torus is resting on the sphere, then the distance between the center of the sphere and the closest point on the torus must be equal to the sphere's radius. So, if the closest point on the torus is at a distance of 11 from the sphere's center, then the distance between the sphere's center and the torus's center is 11 - r_torus_closest. But the torus's closest point is 6 - 3 = 3 units from the torus's center. Therefore, the distance between the sphere's center and the torus's center is 11 - 3 = 8 units. 

Similarly, when the torus is resting on the inside of the sphere, the farthest point on the torus is 6 + 3 = 9 units from the torus's center. Therefore, the distance between the sphere's center and the torus's center is 11 + 9 = 20 units. 

Wait, this seems like a possible approach. Let me formalize this. 

When the torus is resting on the outside of the sphere, the closest point on the torus to the sphere's center is at a distance equal to the sphere's radius. Therefore, the distance between the sphere's center and the torus's center is the sphere's radius minus the torus's minor radius. Similarly, when resting on the inside, the distance is the sphere's radius plus the torus's minor radius. 

But wait, the torus is a surface, so the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's center would be such that the closest point on the torus to the sphere's center is equal to the sphere's radius. Let me explain. 

If the sphere is centered at point O, and the torus is centered at point C, then the closest distance between O and the torus is |OC| - r_torus, where r_torus is the minor radius. For the sphere to be tangent to the torus, this closest distance must equal the sphere's radius. Therefore:

|OC| - r_torus = R_sphere

Similarly, when the torus is resting on the inside of the sphere, the farthest point on the torus from O is |OC| + r_torus, and this must equal the sphere's radius:

|OC| + r_torus = R_sphere

Therefore, we have two equations:

1. |OC| - 3 = 11 => |OC| = 14
2. |OC| + 3 = 11 => |OC| = 8

But these two equations give |OC| = 14 and |OC| = 8, which is impossible. Therefore, there must be a different interpretation. 

Wait, perhaps the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's center is such that the closest point on the torus is at the sphere's surface. So:

|OC| - r_torus = R_sphere => |OC| = R_sphere + r_torus = 11 + 3 = 14

Similarly, when the torus is resting on the inside, the farthest point on the torus from the sphere's center is at the sphere's surface:

|OC| + r_torus = R_sphere => |OC| = R_sphere - r_torus = 11 - 3 = 8

But this gives two different values for |OC|, which is impossible. Therefore, this suggests that the torus cannot be tangent to the sphere both externally and internally. 

But the problem states that it is tangent along a circle when resting on the outside and along a circle when resting on the inside. Therefore, my assumption must be wrong. 

Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to the torus being tangent to the sphere along a circle when resting on the outside, meaning that the sphere is inside the torus, and vice versa. 

If the sphere is inside the torus, then the closest point on the torus to the sphere's center would be |OC| - r_torus = R_sphere => |OC| = R_sphere + r_torus = 11 + 3 = 14. 

When the torus is resting on the inside of the sphere, the farthest point on the torus from the sphere's center is |OC| + r_torus = R_sphere => |OC| = R_sphere - r_torus = 11 - 3 = 8. 

But again, this gives two different values for |OC|, which is impossible. 

Therefore, this suggests that the problem is not possible as stated. However, since the problem is given, there must be a misunderstanding in my modeling. 

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the sphere as the one that is being rested upon by the torus. Wait, no, the problem says "when T rests on the outside of S", meaning the torus is resting on the sphere. 

Alternatively, perhaps the sphere is not centered at the origin. Wait, the problem doesn't specify the sphere's center. If the sphere is not centered at the origin, then the distance between the sphere's center and the torus's center can be adjusted. 

But the problem states that the torus is revolving around the axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance 6 from the center of the circle. This suggests that the torus is generated relative to the origin, which is the center of the sphere. Therefore, the torus is centered at the origin. 

But if the torus is centered at the origin, then the closest point is 6 - 3 = 3, which is less than the sphere's radius 11, and the farthest is 6 + 3 = 9, which is still less than 11. Therefore, the sphere cannot be tangent to the torus. 

This is very confusing. 

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the torus as a 3D object that intersects the sphere, and the circles of tangency are the intersections where the sphere and torus are tangent along a circle. In this case, the circles would be the points where the sphere and torus intersect, but with multiplicity. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a parametrization where the torus is not centered at the origin. Let me try to model the torus centered at (d, 0, 0), and the sphere centered at the origin. Then, the distance between centers is d. The torus's closest point to the origin is d - 3, and the farthest is d + 3. 

When the torus is tangent to the sphere externally, the closest point on the torus is at distance 11 from the origin, so:

d - 3 = 11 => d = 14

When the torus is tangent to the sphere internally, the farthest point on the torus is at distance 11 from the origin:

d + 3 = 11 => d = 8

But these are two different values of d. Therefore, the problem is impossible as stated. 

But the problem says that both conditions are satisfied, so there must be a different interpretation. 

Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to the torus being tangent to the sphere along a circle, meaning that the sphere is tangent to the torus along a single circle, either externally or internally. 

In that case, the distance between the sphere's center and the torus's center must be such that the sphere's radius is equal to the radius of the circle of tangency. 

Wait, if the sphere is tangent to the torus along a circle, then the circle lies on both the sphere and the torus. Therefore, the sphere and torus intersect along a circle, which is the circle of tangency. 

In this case, the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's center would be sqrt(R_sphere^2 - r_circle^2), where r_circle is the radius of the circle of tangency. But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, perhaps the radius of the circle of tangency is the sphere's radius, but that doesn't make sense. 

Wait, let's consider the sphere and the torus as two surfaces intersecting along a circle. The circle of intersection would satisfy both the sphere's equation and the torus's equation. The problem states that when resting on the outside, the torus is externally tangent along a circle with radius r_i, and when resting on the inside, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. The difference r_i - r_o is m/n. 

Given that the problem states that when resting on the outside, the torus is externally tangent to the sphere along a circle of radius r_i, and when resting on the inside, along a circle of radius r_o. We need to find r_i - r_o. 

But according to the problem statement, when resting on the outside, the torus is externally tangent to the sphere along a circle with radius r_i, and when resting on the inside, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. The difference r_i - r_o is equal to m/n. 

Given that, perhaps the key is to find the radii of the circles of tangency when the torus is externally and internally tangent to the sphere, and then compute the difference. 

But earlier attempts to find these radii led to contradictions, suggesting that the problem might have a different configuration. 

Alternatively, perhaps the torus is not centered at the origin, but the sphere is. Let's assume the sphere is centered at the origin, and the torus is centered at a point along the axis of revolution, at a distance d from the origin. Then, the torus's closest point to the origin is d - 3, and the farthest is d + 3. 

When the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the closest point on the torus is at the sphere's surface, so d - 3 = 11 => d = 14. 

When the torus is internally tangent to the sphere, the farthest point on the torus is at the sphere's surface, so d + 3 = 11 => d = 8. 

But since the problem states that both conditions are satisfied, this suggests that d must be both 14 and 8, which is impossible. Therefore, this interpretation is invalid. 

Therefore, perhaps the problem is using a different configuration where the torus is placed in such a way that it can be externally and internally tangent to the sphere at the same time. This seems impossible unless the sphere is somehow variable in radius, which it isn't. 

Given that, I must conclude that there's a misunderstanding in the problem setup. However, since the problem is given, I must proceed with the assumption that such a configuration exists. 

Let me consider the problem from a different angle. Suppose that when the torus is externally tangent to the sphere along a circle, the radius of that circle is r_i, and when it's internally tangent, the radius is r_o. The problem is asking for r_i - r_o. 

Assuming that the sphere is centered at the origin, and the torus is centered at a distance D from the origin along the z-axis, then the closest point on the torus is D - 3, and the farthest is D + 3. 

For external tangency, D - 3 = 11 => D = 14. 

For internal tangency, D + 3 = 11 => D = 8. 

But these are two different positions of the torus. Therefore, it's impossible for the same torus to be externally and internally tangent to the sphere. 

Therefore, perhaps the problem is considering the torus in different positions, one when it's on the outside and one when it's on the inside, and each time, it's tangent along a circle. 

But the problem states "the difference r_i - r_o can be written as m/n", implying that both r_i and r_o are defined for the same torus configuration. Therefore, there must be a consistent way to compute these radii. 

Given that I'm stuck, perhaps I need to look for another approach. 

Let me consider that the circle of tangency when resting on the outside is the intersection of the sphere and the torus. The radius of this circle is r_i, and when resting on the inside, it's r_o. 

The sphere has radius 11, and the torus has major radius 6 and minor radius 3. 

The circle of tangency lies on both the sphere and the torus. Let's find the radius of such a circle. 

The radius of the circle of tangency can be found using the formula for the radius of a circle formed by the intersection of a sphere and a torus. 

The general formula for the radius of the circle of intersection between a sphere and a torus is given by:

r_intersection = sqrt(R_sphere^2 - (D - R_torus)^2)

where D is the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus, R_torus is the major radius of the torus, and R_sphere is the radius of the sphere. 

But I need to verify this. 

Alternatively, consider that the circle of intersection lies on a plane. The distance from the center of the sphere to this plane is h. Then, the radius of the circle of intersection is sqrt(R_sphere^2 - h^2). 

But how does the torus factor into this? 

The torus can be thought of as all points at a distance R_torus from a circle of radius r_torus. 

Alternatively, the radius of the circle of intersection between the sphere and the torus can be found by considering the distance from the sphere's center to the center of the torus. 

Let me denote the distance between the centers as D. The torus is centered at a distance D from the origin. The radius of the circle of intersection is given by the formula:

r_intersection = sqrt(R_sphere^2 - h^2)

where h is the distance from the sphere's center to the plane of the circle. 

But the plane of the circle is also the plane containing the torus's generating circle. 

The distance from the sphere's center to the plane of the circle is h, and the radius of the circle is sqrt(R_sphere^2 - h^2). 

But how does the torus factor into this? 

The torus is defined by its major radius R and minor radius r. The circle of intersection lies on the torus, so the points on the circle must satisfy both the sphere and the torus equations. 

Alternatively, the radius of the circle of intersection can be found using the formula:

r_intersection = sqrt(R_sphere^2 - (D - R_torus)^2)

This formula comes from considering the distance between the centers and the major radius. 

Applying this formula for the external tangency case:

r_i = sqrt(11^2 - (D - 6)^2)

Similarly, for internal tangency:

r_o = sqrt(11^2 - (D + 6)^2)

But since the problem states that when resting on the outside, the torus is externally tangent along a circle of radius r_i, and when resting on the inside, it's internally tangent along a circle of radius r_o, we need to relate D to these radii. 

Wait, but when resting on the outside, the distance between the sphere's center and the torus's center is D = 14 (from earlier), and when resting on the inside, D = 8. But since the problem asks for the difference r_i - r_o, which would be sqrt(121 - (14 - 6)^2) - sqrt(121 - (8 + 6)^2). 

Wait, let's compute this:

For external tangency:

r_i = sqrt(11^2 - (14 - 6)^2) = sqrt(121 - 64) = sqrt(57)

For internal tangency:

r_o = sqrt(11^2 - (8 + 6)^2) = sqrt(121 - 196) = sqrt(-75)

Which is imaginary. Therefore, this approach is invalid. 

Therefore, there must be a different approach. 

Wait, perhaps the formula for the radius of the circle of intersection between a sphere and a torus is different. Let me look it up mentally. 

I recall that the radius of the circle formed by the intersection of a sphere and a torus can be found using the formula:

r = sqrt(R^2 - a^2 - b^2)

where a and b are parameters related to the torus and sphere. But I can't recall the exact formula. 

Alternatively, perhaps the radius of the circle of intersection is given by sqrt(R_sphere^2 - (D - R_torus)^2), where D is the distance between centers. 

But as we saw earlier, this leads to an imaginary number when D = 8. 

Alternatively, if the circle of intersection is the set of points where the sphere and torus meet, then the radius of the circle is determined by the points where the torus is tangent to the sphere. 

Alternatively, perhaps the radius of the circle of tangency is the same as the minor radius of the torus, but that seems unlikely. 

Alternatively, perhaps the radius of the circle is the same as the radius of the torus's generating circle, which is 3. But when the torus is tangent to the sphere, this would mean that the generating circle is entirely within the sphere, which is not the case. 

This is very confusing. 

Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I think I need to look for an alternative approach. 

Let me consider that the problem is asking for the difference between the radii of the circles of tangency when the torus is externally and internally tangent to the sphere. The key is that these circles lie on the torus, and their radii are related to the torus's geometry. 

When the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the circle of tangency is a cross-section of the torus. Similarly, when it's internally tangent, the circle is another cross-section. 

The radius of the circle of tangency would be the distance from the center of the generating circle of the torus to the point where it touches the sphere. 

But since the torus is tangent to the sphere, the radius of the circle would be the distance from the sphere's center to the center of the generating circle minus the major radius. 

Wait, perhaps the radius of the circle of tangency is the distance from the sphere's center to the center of the generating circle minus the major radius. 

But in that case, when the torus is externally tangent, the distance from the sphere's center to the generating circle's center is 11 + 6 = 17, and the radius of the circle of tangency would be 17 - 3 = 14. But that's larger than the sphere's radius, which doesn't make sense. 

Alternatively, if the sphere's center is at a distance D from the torus's center, then the radius of the circle of tangency is sqrt(D^2 - (R_sphere - R_torus)^2). 

For external tangency: D - R_torus = R_sphere => D = R_sphere + R_torus = 11 + 6 = 17. Then, the radius of the circle of tangency would be sqrt(17^2 - (11 - 6)^2) = sqrt(289 - 25) = sqrt(264) = 2*sqrt(66). 

Similarly, for internal tangency: R_sphere + R_torus = D => D = 11 + 6 = 17. Wait, same as external. This doesn't make sense. 

Alternatively, for internal tangency, the formula is sqrt(D^2 - (R_sphere + R_torus)^2). But if D = 14 (from earlier), then sqrt(14^2 - (11 + 6)^2) = sqrt(196 - 289) = imaginary. 

This is not working. 

Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I think I need to conclude that there is a specific geometric relationship that I'm missing, and perhaps the answer is m/n = 17/3, leading to m + n = 20. But I'm not sure. 

However, given the problem's constraints and the lack of progress in finding a valid solution, I will proceed to the final answer based on the assumption that the difference r_i - r_o is 17/3, leading to m + n = 20.
