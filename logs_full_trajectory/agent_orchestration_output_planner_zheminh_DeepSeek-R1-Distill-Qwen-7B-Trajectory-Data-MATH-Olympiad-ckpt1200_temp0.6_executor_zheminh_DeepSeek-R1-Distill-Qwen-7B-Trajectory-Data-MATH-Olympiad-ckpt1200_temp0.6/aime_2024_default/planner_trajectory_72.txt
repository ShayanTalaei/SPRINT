</Question>

<think>
<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem step by step.

First, since z is a complex number with magnitude 4, I can represent z in polar form. That might make the expression easier to handle. Let me recall that any complex number z with |z| = r can be written as z = r e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. So in this case, since |z| = 4, z can be written as 4 e^{iθ} where θ is some angle between 0 and 2π.

Let me substitute z = 4 e^{iθ} into the expression. Let's compute each part separately.

<prompt_1.1> Substitute z = 4 e^{iθ} into the expression and compute each part separately. </prompt_1.1>

Alternatively, maybe there's another approach to confirm this result. Let me think. Another method might be to use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or some other inequality, but given that we already transformed the problem into variables x and y and arrived at the same result, I think this is solid.

Alternatively, maybe using calculus on θ. Let me try that as another check.

<execution_1.1>
First, compute (75 + 117i)z. Substituting z = 4 e^{iθ}, this becomes (75 + 117i) * 4 e^{iθ}. Let me compute the product (75 + 117i) * 4 first. 75*4 = 300, 117*4 = 468. So that's 300 + 468i. Then multiplying by e^{iθ}, which is cosθ + i sinθ. So the first term becomes (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ). Let me expand this:

300 cosθ + 300 i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ.

Since i^2 = -1, this becomes:

300 cosθ + 300 i sinθ + 468i cosθ - 468 sinθ.

Now, combine the real and imaginary parts:

Real part: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ

Imaginary part: 300 sinθ + 468 cosθ

So the first term, (75 + 117i)z, has real part 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ.

Now, the second term is (96 + 144i)/z. Since z = 4 e^{iθ}, 1/z = (1/4) e^{-iθ} = (1/4)(cos(-θ) + i sin(-θ)) = (1/4)(cosθ - i sinθ). So multiplying (96 + 144i) by (1/4)(cosθ - i sinθ):

First, compute (96 + 144i)*(1/4) = 24 + 36i.

Then multiply by (cosθ - i sinθ):

24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ.

Again, i^2 = -1, so:

24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ + 36 sinθ.

Combine real and imaginary parts:

Real part: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ

Imaginary part: -24 sinθ + 36 cosθ

So the second term, (96 + 144i)/z, has real part 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ.

Therefore, the total real part of the entire expression is the sum of the real parts from both terms:

(300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) = (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

So the problem reduces to finding the maximum value of 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, where θ is a real number. Because the real part is a function of θ, and we need to maximize this expression.

<execution_1.2>
Express the real part as a function of θ and take its derivative to find maxima. Let's see.

We had earlier:

Re[(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z] = 75 x + 117 y + 96 x /16 + 144 y /16

= 75 x + 117 y + 6 x + 9 y = 81 x + 126 y

But since x = 4 cosθ and y = 4 sinθ, this becomes:

81*(4 cosθ) + 126*(4 sinθ) = 324 cosθ + 504 sinθ

Which is 324 cosθ + 504 sinθ. To find the maximum of this expression, we can write it as R cos(θ - φ), where R = sqrt(324² + 504²). Let's compute R:

324² = 104,976

504² = 254,016

Sum: 104,976 + 254,016 = 358,992

sqrt(358,992) = let's compute this:

Since 599² = 358,801 and 600² = 360,000. So sqrt(358,992) is between 599 and 600. Let's compute 599² = 358,801, so 358,992 - 358,801 = 191. So sqrt(358,992) = 599 + 191/(2*599) + ... approximately 599 + 0.159 ≈ 599.159. But actually, maybe exact value?

Wait, 324 and 504 have a common factor. Let's check GCD of 324 and 504.

Factors of 324: 2^2 * 3^4

Factors of 504: 2^3 * 3^2 * 7

GCD is 2^2 * 3^2 = 4 * 9 = 36. So divide numerator and denominator by 36:

324 /36 = 9, 504 /36 = 14. So R = 36 * sqrt(9² +14²) = 36 * sqrt(81 + 196) = 36 * sqrt(277). Wait, 9² is 81, 14² is 196, sum is 277. So sqrt(277) is irrational, so R = 36 sqrt(277). Therefore, the maximum value of 324 cosθ + 504 sinθ is 36 sqrt(277). Therefore, the maximum real part is 36 sqrt(277). Wait, but 36*sqrt(277) is approximately 36*16.6433 ≈ 36*16.6433 ≈ 600.36. But earlier, when we computed (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z with z = 4 e^{iθ_max}, we got 81*4 cosθ + 126*4 sinθ = 324 cosθ + 504 sinθ, which is the same expression. So the maximum is 36 sqrt(277). Wait, but 36*sqrt(277) is approximately 36*16.6433 ≈ 600.36, which is the same as before.

But wait, in the earlier approach, when we computed the expression with z = 4 e^{iθ}, we found that the real part is 324 cosθ + 504 sinθ, whose maximum is 36 sqrt(277). Therefore, the maximum real part is 36 sqrt(277). However, when we computed the expression using the initial complex numbers, we found that the maximum real part is 360 + 504*sqrt(2)/2. Wait, but 36 sqrt(277) is approximately 600.36, which is different from 360 + 504*sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 360 + 504*0.707 ≈ 360 + 356.9 ≈ 716.9.

Wait, this discrepancy suggests that there was a mistake in one of the approaches.

Wait, let me check the first approach again.



Alternatively, let's compute sqrt(277). 16^2 = 256, 17^2=289, so sqrt(277) ≈ 16.6433. Then 36*16.6433 ≈ 599.16. Which is approximately 600.

But earlier, when we computed 360 + 504*sqrt(2)/2, which is 360 + 504*0.707 ≈ 360 + 356.9 ≈ 716.9. But this contradicts the other result. So which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first approach. Let me check.

Based on execution_1.1:
Let me recall that for any expression of the form A cosθ + B sinθ, its maximum value is sqrt(A² + B²). That's a standard result from trigonometry. So the maximum value of 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ is sqrt(324² + (-432)²).

Let me compute that.

<execution_2.1>
First, compute 324 squared. 300² = 90,000, 24² = 576, and 2*300*24 = 14,400. So (300 + 24)² = 300² + 2*300*24 + 24² = 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 104,976.

Then, 432 squared. Let's compute 400² = 160,000, 32² = 1,024, and 2*400*32 = 25,600. So 432² = (400 + 32)² = 400² + 2*400*32 + 32² = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 186,624.

So A² + B² = 104,976 + 186,624 = 291,600. Then sqrt(291,600). Let's compute sqrt(291600). Since 291600 = 2916 * 100, and sqrt(2916) = 54 (since 54² = 2916). Therefore, sqrt(291600) = 54 * 10 = 540. Therefore, the maximum value of the real part is 540.

Wait, but hold on. Let me verify that again.

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
We had A = 324, B = -432. So A² + B² = 324² + (-432)² = 104,976 + 186,624 = 291,600. sqrt(291,600) = 540. So the maximum value is 540. Therefore, the largest possible real part is 540.

But wait, that seems straightforward, but let me check if there's a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me retrace.

First, we converted z to polar form with |z| = 4, so z = 4 e^{iθ}. Then, computed (75 + 117i)z and (96 + 144i)/z, expanded them, combined the real parts, and arrived at 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. Then, using the standard formula, the maximum is sqrt(324² + 432²) = 540. So that seems correct.

First term: (75 + 117i)z. We computed 75*4 = 300, 117*4 = 468, so 300 + 468i. Then multiplied by e^{iθ} to get (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ). Expanded to get 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ (real part) and 300 sinθ + 468 cosθ (imaginary part). That seems correct.

Second term: (96 + 144i)/z. 1/z = (1/4)e^{-iθ}, so (96 + 144i)*(1/4)(cosθ - i sinθ). 96/4 = 24, 144/4 = 36, so 24 + 36i. Then multiplying by (cosθ - i sinθ):

24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i² sinθ. Since i² = -1, this becomes 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ (real part) and -24 sinθ + 36 cosθ (imaginary part). So real part is 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ. That seems correct.

Adding the two real parts: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ + 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ = (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. Correct.
</execution_4.1>

<execution_4.2>
Let me think. The expression is (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z. Let me denote A = 75 + 117i, B = 96 + 144i. Then the expression is A z + B / z. Since |z| = 4, then z is a complex number with |z|=4, so 1/z = conjugate(z)/|z|² = conjugate(z)/16. Therefore, B / z = (B / 16) conjugate(z). So the expression becomes A z + (B / 16) conjugate(z). Let me write this as A z + C conjugate(z), where C = B / 16.

Let me compute C:

B = 96 + 144i, so C = (96 + 144i)/16 = 6 + 9i.

Therefore, the expression is A z + C conjugate(z), where A = 75 + 117i, C = 6 + 9i.

Now, let me write z as x + yi, where x and y are real numbers such that x² + y² = 16 (since |z| = 4). Then conjugate(z) = x - yi.

So the expression becomes:

(75 + 117i)(x + yi) + (6 + 9i)(x - yi)

Let me compute each term separately.

First term: (75 + 117i)(x + yi) = 75x + 75yi + 117i x + 117i^2 y = 75x + 75yi + 117xi - 117y

Second term: (6 + 9i)(x - yi) = 6x - 6yi + 9i x - 9i^2 y = 6x - 6yi + 9xi + 9y

Combine both terms:

First term real parts: 75x - 117y

First term imaginary parts: 75y + 117x

Second term real parts: 6x + 9y

Second term imaginary parts: -6y + 9x

Combine real parts: 75x - 117y + 6x + 9y = (75x + 6x) + (-117y + 9y) = 81x - 108y

Combine imaginary parts: 75y + 117x -6y +9x = (75y -6y) + (117x +9x) = 69y +126x

Therefore, the expression is (81x - 108y) + i(69y +126x). The real part is 81x - 108y, and the imaginary part is 69y + 126x. But we are interested in the real part, which is 81x - 108y. So we need to maximize 81x - 108y subject to x² + y² = 16.

This is another optimization problem. Let's see if we can solve it using Lagrange multipliers or by parametrization.

Alternatively, note that 81x - 108y can be written as 81x - 108y = 81x - 108y. Let me factor out 81 and 108: GCD of 81 and 108 is 27. So 81 = 27*3, 108 = 27*4. Therefore, 81x - 108y = 27*(3x - 4y). So we need to maximize 27*(3x - 4y) subject to x² + y² = 16. Therefore, the maximum value is 27 times the maximum of (3x - 4y) with x² + y² = 16.

The maximum of 3x - 4y subject to x² + y² = 16 is the same as the magnitude of the vector (3, -4) times the magnitude of (x, y), but since (x, y) has magnitude 4, but wait, actually, the maximum of 3x - 4y is the dot product of (3, -4) and (x, y). The maximum value of this dot product is the magnitude of (3, -4) times the magnitude of (x, y). The magnitude of (3, -4) is 5, and the magnitude of (x, y) is 4. Therefore, the maximum value is 5*4 = 20. Therefore, the maximum of 3x - 4y is 20. Therefore, the maximum of 27*(3x -4y) is 27*20 = 540. So the maximum real part is 540. Therefore, this confirms the previous result.

So regardless of the method used, the maximum real part is 540.

Therefore, the answer is 540.

But wait, just to make sure, let's check if there's any alternative approach or possible mistake.

For example, is there a case where the maximum is achieved at a different point? Let's think. The expression 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ is a sinusoidal function, which reaches its maximum at θ where the derivative is zero. Let me compute θ to confirm.

The maximum of A cosθ + B sinθ occurs at θ where tanθ = -B/A. Wait, actually, the formula is that the maximum occurs at θ = arctan(B/A) or something else? Wait, let me recall. For A cosθ + B sinθ, the maximum is sqrt(A² + B²) and occurs at θ = arctan(B/A) or something. Wait, actually, the maximum occurs when the derivative is zero.

Let me compute the derivative of f(θ) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

f'(θ) = -324 sinθ - 432 cosθ.

Set derivative to zero:

-324 sinθ - 432 cosθ = 0

Multiply both sides by -1:

324 sinθ + 432 cosθ = 0

Divide both sides by 324:

sinθ + (432/324) cosθ = 0

Simplify 432/324: divide numerator and denominator by 108: 4/3. So:

sinθ + (4/3) cosθ = 0

Multiply both sides by 3:

3 sinθ + 4 cosθ = 0

Then, 3 sinθ = -4 cosθ

Divide both sides by cosθ (assuming cosθ ≠ 0):

3 tanθ = -4

Therefore, tanθ = -4/3

So θ = arctan(-4/3). The solutions are θ = -arctan(4/3) + kπ. Let's take θ = arctan(-4/3) which is in the fourth quadrant, or θ = arctan(-4/3) + π which is in the second quadrant.

Compute sinθ and cosθ for θ = arctan(-4/3). Let's say θ is in the fourth quadrant. Then, if tanθ = -4/3, we can think of a right triangle with opposite side -4 and adjacent side 3, hypotenuse 5. Therefore, cosθ = 3/5, sinθ = -4/5.

Alternatively, if θ is in the second quadrant, tanθ = -4/3, so opposite side 4, adjacent side -3, hypotenuse 5, so cosθ = -3/5, sinθ = 4/5.

So let's compute f(θ) at these two points.

First, θ in the fourth quadrant: cosθ = 3/5, sinθ = -4/5.

f(θ) = 324*(3/5) - 432*(-4/5) = (324*3 + 432*4)/5 = (972 + 1728)/5 = 2700/5 = 540.

Second, θ in the second quadrant: cosθ = -3/5, sinθ = 4/5.

f(θ) = 324*(-3/5) - 432*(4/5) = (-972 - 1728)/5 = (-2700)/5 = -540.

Therefore, the maximum is indeed 540, achieved at θ where cosθ = 3/5, sinθ = -4/5. Therefore, this confirms that the maximum is 540.

Therefore, after multiple approaches and verification, the largest possible real part is 540.
