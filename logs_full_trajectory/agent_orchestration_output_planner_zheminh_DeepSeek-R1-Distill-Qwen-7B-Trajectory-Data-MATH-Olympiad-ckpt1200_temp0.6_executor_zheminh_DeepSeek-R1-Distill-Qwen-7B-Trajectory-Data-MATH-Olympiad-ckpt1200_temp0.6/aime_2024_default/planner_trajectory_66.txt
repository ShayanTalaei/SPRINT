Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to find the radius squared of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box with surface area 54 and volume 23. Then express r² as a reduced fraction p/q and find p + q. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem.

First, a rectangular box has dimensions length, width, and height. Let's denote them as x, y, z. The surface area of a box is given by 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54, and the volume is xyz = 23. The sphere that can contain the box must have a diameter equal to the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal d of a box is sqrt(x² + y² + z²). Therefore, the radius r of the sphere is half of that, so r = (sqrt(x² + y² + z²))/2. Therefore, r² = (x² + y² + z²)/4.

So, to find the smallest sphere that can contain any such box, we need to minimize r², which is equivalent to minimizing x² + y² + z² given the constraints on surface area and volume.
So, the problem reduces to minimizing x² + y² + z² subject to 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 and xyz = 23.

Wait, but the sphere has to contain the box for all possible boxes in set B. So, the radius r must be the maximum possible space diagonal over all boxes in B, but the question is asking for the smallest sphere that can contain each of the boxes. Wait, maybe I need to find the minimal r such that every box in B fits inside a sphere of radius r. Therefore, r must be the maximum space diagonal among all boxes in B. So, we need to find the maximum possible value of sqrt(x² + y² + z²) given the constraints, and then r is that maximum divided by 2, so r² would be (max x² + y² + z²)/4.
Therefore, the problem is to maximize x² + y² + z² given that 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 and xyz = 23.

So, the key is to maximize x² + y² + z² under these constraints.

How do we approach this? Maybe using Lagrange multipliers, but since this is symmetric in x, y, z, perhaps there's a symmetric solution or we can use inequalities. Let me think.

<prompt_1.1> Set up the problem of maximizing x² + y² + z² given the constraints 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 and xyz = 23. Use Lagrange multipliers to set up the system of equations. </prompt_1.1>
-----

But let me check with another approach to confirm. Suppose we use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Let me set up the problem again.

<prompt_1.2> Use the method of Lagrange multipliers to confirm the maximum value of x² + y² + z², find the radius r, and verify the fraction p/q. </prompt_1.2>

Just to be thorough, let's check if there's another critical point or if the maximum occurs at boundaries. But since x, y, z are positive real numbers, and the constraints are smooth, the maximum should occur at the critical point found. Therefore, the answer is 145/4, so p + q = 149.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{149}

Let me denote S = x + y + z, P = xy + +zx +,y surface area is 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54, so xy + yz + zx = 27. The volume is xyz = 23. We need to maximize x² + y² + z². We know that x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx) = S² - 54. Therefore, to maximize x² + y² + z², we need to maximize S². So, the problem reduces to maximizing S = x + y + z given that xy + yz + zx = 27 and xyz = 23.

Hmm, so we need to maximize S = x + y + z with the constraints xy + yz + zx = 27 and xyz = 23.

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
This seems like a constrained optimization problem. Let's denote variables as x, y, z.

We can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Let’s set up the Lagrangian function:

<prompt_2.1> Use Lagrange multipliers to find the maximum value of S = x + y + z given the constraints xy + yz + zx = 27 and xyz = 23. </prompt_2.1>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
L = x + y + z - λ(xy + yz + zx - 27) - μ(xyz - 23)

Taking partial derivatives:

∂L/∂x = 1 - λ(y + z) - μ(yz) = 0

∂L/∂y = 1 - λ(x + z) - μ(xz) = 0

∂L/∂z = 1 - λ(x + y) - μ(xy) = 0

And the constraints:

xy + yz + zx = 27

xyz = 23

So, we have four equations:

1. 1 - λ(y + z) - μ(yz) = 0

2. 1 - λ(x + z) - μ(xz) = 0

3. 1 - λ(x + y) - μ(xy) = 0

4. xy + yz + zx = 27

5. xyz = 23

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Let’s subtract the first equation from the second:

<prompt_3.1> Subtract the first equation from the second and third to find the relationships between x, y, z, and the Lagrange multipliers. </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
[1 - λ(y + z) - μ(yz)] - [1 - λ(x + z) - μ(xz)] = 0

Simplify:

-λ(y + z - x - z) - μ(yz - xz) = 0

-λ(y - x) - μ z(y - x) = 0

Factor out (y - x):

(y - x)(-λ - μ z) = 0

Similarly, subtract first equation from third:

[1 - λ(x + y) - μ(xy)] - [1 - λ(y + z) - μ(yz)] = 0

Simplify:

-λ(x + y - y - z) - μ(xy - yz) = 0

-λ(x - z) - μ y(x - z) = 0

Factor out (x - z):

(x - z)(-λ - μ y) = 0

Therefore, from the first subtraction, either y = x or -λ - μ z = 0. Similarly, from the second subtraction, either x = z or -λ - μ y = 0.

Assuming that x, y, z are not all equal (since if they were, the surface area and volume would have specific values, but let's check if that's possible).

Suppose x = y = z. Then the surface area would be 6x² = 54 ⇒ x² = 9 ⇒ x = 3. Then the volume would be x³ = 27, but the given volume is 23, which is less than 27.
</execution_3.1>
</Execution_3>

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
Therefore, x, y, z are not all equal. So, we must have the other cases.

From the first subtraction: either y = x or -λ - μ z = 0.

Case 1: y = x

Then, from the second subtraction: (x - z)(-λ - μ y) = 0

If y = x, then this becomes (x - z)(-λ - μ x) = 0

So either x = z or -λ - μ x = 0.

If x = z, then all three variables are equal, which we already saw is not possible.

Therefore, in this case, -λ - μ x = 0 ⇒ λ = -μ x.

Now, let's go back to the first equation:

<prompt_4.1> Analyze case 1 where y = x, and derive the relationship between λ and μ using the first equation. </prompt_4.1>

Similarly, from the second equation:

<prompt_4.2> Analyze case 1 where y = x, and derive the relationship between λ and μ using the second equation. </prompt_4.2>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
1 - λ(y + z) - μ(yz) = 0

But since y = x and z = z, substitute:

1 - λ(x + z) - μ(x z) = 0

But we have λ = -μ x, so substitute:

1 - (-μ x)(x + z) - μ(x z) = 0

Simplify:

1 + μ x(x + z) - μ x z = 0

1 + μ x² + μ x z - μ x z = 0

Simplify terms:

1 + μ x² = 0 ⇒ μ = -1 / x²

So, μ = -1 / x², and λ = -μ x = (1 / x²) x = 1 / x
</execution_4.1>

<execution_4.2>
1 - λ(y + z) - μ(yz) = 0

But y = x, so:

1 - λ(x + z) - μ(x z) = 0

But we also have λ = -μ x, from above.
</execution_4.2>
</Execution_4>

<Plan_5>
Based on execution_4.1, execution_4.2:
Substitute λ = -μ x into the equation:

1 - (-μ x)(x + z) - μ(x z) = 0

Again, same as before:

1 + μ x(x + z) - μ x z = 0

1 + μ x² + μ x z - μ x z = 0

1 + μ x² = 0 ⇒ μ = -1 / x²

So, same result. Therefore, in this case, we have μ = -1 / x², λ = 1 / x.

Now, moving to the third equation:

1 - λ(x + y) - μ(x y) = 0

But y = x, so:

1 - λ(2x) - μ(x²) = 0

Substitute λ = 1 / x and μ = -1 / x²:

1 - (1 / x)(2x) - (-1 / x²)(x²) = 0

Simplify:

1 - 2 + 1 = 0 ⇒ 0 = 0

So, the third equation is satisfied. Therefore, in this case, with y = x, the equations are satisfied if μ = -1 / x² and λ = 1 / x.

Now, we need to use the constraints: xy + yz + zx = 27 and xyz = 23.

Since y = x, let's denote x = y. Then, the constraints become:

<prompt_5.1> Substitute y = x into the constraints and solve for x and z. </prompt_5.1>
</Plan_5>

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
x² + 2 x z = 27

x² z = 23

So, we have two equations:

1. x² + 2 x z = 27

2. x² z = 23

From equation 2: z = 23 / x²

Substitute into equation 1:

x² + 2 x * (23 / x²) = 27

Simplify:

x² + 46 / x = 27

Multiply both sides by x to eliminate denominator:

x³ + 46 = 27 x

Rearrange:

x³ - 27 x + 46 = 0

So, we need to solve the cubic equation x³ - 27 x + 46 = 0
</execution_5.1>
</Execution_5>

<Plan_6>
Based on execution_5.1:
Let me try to factor this cubic equation.

<prompt_6.1> Solve the cubic equation x³ - 27x + 46 = 0 by testing possible rational roots. </prompt_6.1>
</Plan_6>

<Execution_6>
<execution_6.1>
Possible rational roots are factors of 46 divided by factors of 1, so ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Test x = 1: 1 - 27 + 46 = 20 ≠ 0

x = 2: 8 - 54 + 46 = 0. Oh, x = 2 is a root.

Therefore, we can factor out (x - 2):

Using polynomial division or synthetic division:

Divide x³ - 27x + 46 by (x - 2):

Coefficients: 1 (x³), 0 (x²), -27 (x), 46 (constant)

Using synthetic division:

2 | 1  0  -27  46

Multiply 2 by 1: 2, add to next coefficient: 0 + 2 = 2

Multiply 2 by 2: 4, add to next coefficient: -27 + 4 = -23

Multiply 2 by -23: -46, add to last coefficient: 46 + (-46) = 0

So, the cubic factors as (x - 2)(x² + 2x - 23) = 0

Therefore, the roots are x = 2 and roots of x² + 2x - 23 = 0. The quadratic equation gives x = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 92)] / 2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)] / 2 = [-2 ± 4 sqrt(6)] / 2 = -1 ± 2 sqrt(6). Since x must be positive, we have x = -1 + 2 sqrt(6). Let's compute that: sqrt(6) ≈ 2.449, so 2 sqrt(6) ≈ 4.898, so x ≈ -1 + 4.898 ≈ 3.898. So, two positive roots: x = 2 and x ≈ 3.898. Let's check x = 2.

If x = 2, then z = 23 / x² = 23 / 4 ≈ 5.75. Then y = x = 2. So, dimensions are 2, 2, 5.75. Let's check surface area: 2(2*2 + 2*5.75 + 2*5.75) = 2(4 + 11.5 + 11.5) = 2(27) = 54. Correct. Volume is 2*2*5.75 = 23. Correct.
</execution_6.1>
</Execution_6>

<Plan_7>
Based on execution_6.1:
So, x = 2 is a valid root. The other root is x = -1 + 2√6 ≈ 3.898. Let's check if that's valid.

<prompt_7.1> Calculate the space diagonal for x = -1 + 2√6 and verify if it gives a larger value than the diagonal for x = 2. </prompt_7.1>
</Plan_7>

<Execution_7>
<execution_7.1>
If x = -1 + 2√6, then z = 23 / x². Let's compute x²: (-1 + 2√6)^2 = 1 - 4√6 + 24 = 25 - 4√6. Therefore, z = 23 / (25 - 4√6). Rationalizing the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (25 + 4√6):

z = 23*(25 + 4√6) / [(25)^2 - (4√6)^2] = 23*(25 + 4√6) / [625 - 16*6] = 23*(25 + 4√6) / [625 - 96] = 23*(25 + 4√6) / 529 = (23/529)*(25 + 4√6) = (1/23)*(25 + 4√6)

So, z = (25 + 4√6)/23. Let's compute the space diagonal squared: x² + y² + z². Since y = x, this is 2x² + z². Let's compute 2x² + z²:

2*(25 - 4√6) + [(25 + 4√6)/23]^2

First, compute 2x²: 2*(25 - 4√6) = 50 - 8√6

Now, compute z²: [(25 + 4√6)/23]^2 = [25 + 4√6]^2 / 23² = (625 + 200√6 + 16*6)/529 = (625 + 200√6 + 96)/529 = (721 + 200√6)/529

Therefore, total x² + y² + z² = (50 - 8√6) + (721 + 200√6)/529

Convert 50 - 8√6 to over 529:

50 = 50*529/529 = 26450/529

-8√6 = -8√6*529/529 = -4232√6/529

So, total:

(26450 - 4232√6 + 721 + 200√6)/529 = (26450 + 721) + (-4232√6 + 200√6) / 529 = 27171 - 4032√6 / 529

Simplify numerator:

27171 - 4032√6 ≈ Let's compute approximate value:

First, compute 4032√6: √6 ≈ 2.449, so 4032*2.449 ≈ 4032*2 + 4032*0.449 ≈ 8064 + 1809 ≈ 9873

So, numerator ≈ 27171 - 9873 ≈ 17298

Therefore, total x² + y² + z² ≈ 17298 / 529 ≈ 32.71

Compare with the previous case where x = 2, y = 2, z = 5.75. Then x² + y² + z² = 4 + 4 + 33.0625 = 41.0625. So, 41.0625 is larger than 32.71. Therefore, the case x = 2 gives a larger space diagonal. Therefore, the maximum occurs at x = 2, y = 2, z = 5.75.

<Plan_8>
Based on execution_6.1, execution_7.1:
Therefore, the maximum x² + y² + z² is 41.0625, which is 41.0625 = 131/4 (since 131 divided by 4 is 32.75, which contradicts previous calculation). Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let's compute x² + y² + z² when x=2, y=2, z=5.75.

x² = 4, y² = 4, z² = (23/4)^2 = 529/16 = 33.0625. So total is 4 + 4 + 33.0625 = 41.0625, which is 41.0625 = 131/4? Wait, 41.0625 * 4 = 164.25, which is 164.25 = 657/4. Wait, 657/4 is 164.25. Wait, 41.0625 is 41 + 1/16, which is 657/16. Wait, 41*16=656, so 41.0625 = 657/16. Wait, 657 divided by 16 is 41.0625. So, 41.0625 = 657/16. Therefore, r² = (657/16)/4 = 657/64.

But wait, let me confirm.

<prompt_9.1> Verify the calculations for x² + y² + z² and x² + y² + z² for x = -1 + 2√6 and confirm the maximum value. </prompt_9.1>

Wait, but let me check if there's another case where y = z or x = z.

<prompt_9.2> Check other cases where two variables are equal and verify if they yield a maximum value. </prompt_9.2>

But let's check if there's another case where two variables are equal. Suppose x = z. Then similar to previous case, but let's verify.

<prompt_9.3> Analyze the case where two variables are equal and verify if it gives the same maximum value as the first case. </prompt_9.3>

Therefore, the maximum value is 657/64, so r² = 657/64, and 657 + 64 = 721. So, the answer is \boxed{721}.
</Plan_9>

<Execution_9>
<execution_9.1>
When x = 2, y = 2, z = 5.75 = 23/4. Then x² + y² + z² = 4 + 4 + (23/4)^2 = 8 + 529/16 = (128/16) + (529/16) = 657/16. Then r² = (657/16)/4 = 657/64. So, 657/64 is the value of r². Therefore, p = 657, q = 64. Are they coprime? Let's check gcd(657,64).

64 factors: 2^6. 657 divided by 2 is 328.5, so not divisible by 2. Therefore, gcd is 1. So, 657 and 64 are coprime. Therefore, p + q = 657 + 64 = 721.
</execution_9.1>

<execution_9.2>
Suppose y = z instead of x = y. Let's see if that gives a different result. Let's suppose y = z.

Then, the constraints become:

xy + y² + x y = 27 ⇒ x(2y) + y² = 27 ⇒ 2x y + y² = 27

xyz = 23 ⇒ x y² = 23 ⇒ x = 23 / y²

Substitute x into the first equation:

2*(23 / y²)*y + y² = 27 ⇒ (46 / y) + y² = 27

Multiply by y:

46 + y³ = 27 y ⇒ y³ - 27 y + 46 = 0

Which is the same cubic equation as before. Therefore, the roots are the same: y = 2, y = -1 + 2√6, and y = -1 - 2√6. Since y must be positive, y = 2 or y = -1 + 2√6 ≈ 3.898. Therefore, same as before, the maximum occurs at y = 2, leading to x = 23 / 4 = 5.75, z = 2. So, same dimensions, just permuted. Therefore, the maximum space diagonal is the same.

Similarly, if we assume x = z, we would get the same result. Therefore, regardless of which two variables are equal, the maximum occurs when two variables are 2 and the third is 23/4 = 5.75, leading to the same space diagonal.

Therefore, the maximum x² + y² + z² is indeed 657/16, so r² = 657/64, which simplifies to 657/64. Since 657 and 64 are coprime (64 is 2^6, 657 is 3*219 = 3*3*73, so no common factors), the fraction is reduced. Therefore, p + q = 657 + 64 = 721.
</execution_9.2>

<execution_9.3>
Suppose x = z. Then, similar to the previous case, if x = z, then the constraints would be similar. Let me see:

Surface area: 2(xy + yz + zx) = 2(x² + 2xy) = 54 ⇒ x² + 2xy = 27

Volume: x² y = 23 ⇒ y = 23 / x²

Substitute into surface area equation:

x² + 2x*(23 / x²) = 27 ⇒ x² + 46 / x = 27

Which is the same equation as before: x³ - 27x + 46 = 0, leading to x = 2, same solution. Therefore, the maximum occurs when two variables are 2 and the third is 5.75, or permutations thereof. Therefore, the maximum x² + y² + z² is 657/16, leading to r² = 657/64.
