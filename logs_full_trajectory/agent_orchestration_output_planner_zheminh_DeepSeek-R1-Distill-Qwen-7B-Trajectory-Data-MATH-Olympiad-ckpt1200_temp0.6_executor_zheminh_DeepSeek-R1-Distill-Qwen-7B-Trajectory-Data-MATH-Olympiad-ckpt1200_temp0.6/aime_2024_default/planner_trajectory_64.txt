Okay, so I need to find the least prime number p such that there's a positive integer n where n^4 + 1 is divisible by p². Then, once I find that p, I have to determine the smallest positive integer m where m^4 + 1 is divisible by p². Hmm, let's start by understanding what the problem is asking.

First, the problem is about primes p where n^4 ≡ -1 mod p² has a solution. So, we're looking for primes p where -1 is a quartic residue modulo p². The first part is to find the minimal such prime p, and then find the minimal m such that m^4 ≡ -1 mod p².

I remember that for primes, if -1 is a quadratic residue modulo p, then p ≡ 1 mod 4. But here, we're dealing with quartic residues. So maybe there's a similar condition for primes where -1 is a quartic residue.

Let me check some small primes first.

<prompt_1.1> Check if -1 is a quartic residue modulo small primes using the above plan. </prompt_1.1>

Now, moving on to the second part. We need to find the smallest m such that m^4 ≡ -1 mod p², where p=29. So, we need to solve m^4 ≡ -1 mod 29².

<execution_1.1>
Let's list the primes starting from the smallest.

The first prime is 2. Let's check if there's an n such that n^4 +1 is divisible by 2²=4. Let's see:

For n=1: 1 +1=2, which is 2 mod 4.
n=2: 16 +1=17, which is 1 mod 4.
n=3: 81 +1=82, which is 2 mod 4.
n=4: 256 +1=257, which is 1 mod 4. Hmm, seems like n^4 +1 modulo 4 cycles between 2 and 1. So, 2 is not a solution here. Therefore, 2 is not such a prime.

Next prime is 3. Let's check n^4 +1 modulo 9.

Compute n^4 modulo 9 for n=1 to 8:

1^4=1 mod9
2^4=16=7 mod9
3^4=81=0 mod9
4^4=(4^2)^2=16^2=256=256-27*9=256-243=13=4 mod9
5^4=(5^2)^2=25^2=625=625-69*9=625-621=4 mod9
6^4=0 mod9
7^4=(7^2)^2=49^2=2401=2401-266*9=2401-2394=7 mod9
8^4=(8^2)^2=64^2=4096=4096-455*9= Wait,4  Let

<execution_1.2>
First, let's recall that 29 is a prime where -1 is a quartic residue. So, there exists some integer n such that n^4 ≡ -1 mod 29². In our previous step, we found n=20, so 20^4 ≡ -1 mod 29². But we need the smallest positive integer m with this property. Since 20 is the smallest such integer mod 29, perhaps m=20? But wait, 20 is less than 29, so maybe 20 is the minimal.

Wait, but maybe there is a smaller m. Let's check if any number smaller than 20 satisfies m^4 ≡ -1 mod 29². Let's compute m^4 mod 29² for m from 1 to 28.

Wait, that's a lot of computations. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, since 20^4 ≡ -1 mod 29², and 20 is the smallest positive integer with this property mod 29, maybe 20 is the minimal m. But let's check m=10.



How about m=15?

Let's check n=1: 1 +1=2 mod9

So, it alternates between 1,8,1,8,... mod9. So, n^4 +1 mod9 is either 1 or 8, which is never 0. Therefore, 3 is not a prime where n^4 +1 is divisible by 9. So, 3 is out.

Let's check if there exists n such that n^4 +1 ≡0 mod25. Let's check n from 1 to 24:

But this might take time. Alternatively, note that if n^4 ≡ -1 mod25, then n^8 ≡1 mod25. So, the order of n modulo 25 divides 8. The multiplicative order of n modulo 25 must divide φ(25)=20. So, the order must divide gcd(8,20)=4. Therefore, possible orders are 1,2,4. If n^4 ≡1 mod25, then n^8 ≡1 mod25, but we need n^4 ≡-1 mod25. However, if the order is 4, then n^4 ≡1 mod25, which contradicts n^4 ≡-1. Therefore, there is no solution for n^4 ≡-1 mod25. Hence, 5 is not such a prime.

10^4=10000. Divide 10000 by 841: 841*11=9251, 10000-9251=749. So 10^4 ≡749 mod841. Which is not -1. So 10 is out.

Similarly, m=15: 15^4=50625. 50625 divided by 841: 841*60=50460, 50625-50460=165. So 15^4 ≡165 mod841≠-1.

m=5: 5^4=625≡625 mod841. Not -1.

m=20: 20^4=160000. 160000 divided by 841: 841*189=841*(190-1)=841*190 -841=159790 -841=158949. Then 160000 -158949=1051. 1051 -841=210. So 20^4≡210 mod841. Wait, but earlier we thought 20^4≡-1 mod841. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the previous calculation.

Wait, maybe I need to recheck. Let's compute 20^4 mod841.

First, note that 20^2=400. Then 20^4=(20^2)^2=400^2=160000. Now divide 160000 by 841.

Compute 841*189=841*(200 -11)=841*200 -841*11=168200 -9251=168200-9251=158949. Then 160000 -158949=1051. Now, 1051 divided by 841 is 1*841=841, remainder 210. So 160000≡210 mod841. But earlier we thought 20^4≡-1 mod841. That can't be. So my previous conclusion was wrong. So maybe 20 isn't the solution?

Wait, this is confusing. Let me check again. If 20^4 ≡ -1 mod29², then 20^4 +1 ≡0 mod841. Let's compute 20^4 +1=160000 +1=160001. Divide 160001 by841.

Wait, so maybe my earlier conclusion was wrong. So, perhaps 29 is not a prime where n^4 +1 is divisible by29².
But that contradicts the problem statement, which says there exists such a prime. So, perhaps my mistake is in assuming that 20 is a solution mod29². Let me check again.

Let's check if there's an n such that n^4 +1 ≡0 mod49. Let's check n from 1 to 48:

Again, this is tedious. Let's see if there's a smarter way. Suppose n^4 ≡ -1 mod49. Then, n^8 ≡1 mod49. So the order of n modulo 49 divides 8, but also divides φ(49)=42. So the order must divide gcd(8,42)=2. Therefore, the order is 1 or 2. If the order is 1, then n ≡1 mod49, but 1^4=1≡1≠-1. If the order is 2, then n^2≡1 mod49, so n≡±1 mod49. Then n^4≡1 mod49, which again contradicts n^4≡-1. Therefore, no solution for 7². So, 7 is out.

Let's check if there's an n such that n^4 ≡ -1 mod121. Let's check n from 1 to 120:

But again, this might take time. Alternatively, note that if n^4 ≡ -1 mod121, then n^8 ≡1 mod121. So, the order of n modulo 121 divides 8. The multiplicative group modulo 121 has order φ(121)=110. So, the order of n must divide gcd(8,110)=2. Therefore, possible orders 1 or 2. If order 1, then n ≡1 mod121, which would give n^4 ≡1 mod121, not -1. If order 2, then n^2 ≡1 mod121, so n^4 ≡1 mod121. Again, not -1. Therefore, there is no solution for n^4 ≡-1 mod121. So, 11 is not such a prime.

20^2=400. 400 mod841 is 400. Then 20^4=(400)^2=160000. Now, compute 160000 mod841. Let's divide 160000 by841.

First, 841*100=84100. 160000 -84100=75900. 841*90=75690. 75900 -75690=210. So, 160000=841*190 +210. Therefore, 20^4=160000≡210 mod841. Then 20^4 +1=211 mod841. So, 20^4 +1≡211 mod841, which is not 0. Therefore, 20 is not a solution. So, maybe my mistake was in the initial step where I thought 20^4≡-1 mod29². That was incorrect. Therefore, perhaps 29 is not such a prime. But the problem states there exists such a prime, so maybe I made a mistake in the modulo calculation.

Let me check 20 mod29. 20 is less than 29, so 20 mod29=20. Then 20^4 mod29. Let's compute 20^2=400≡400-13*29=400-377=23 mod29. Then 20^4=(23)^2=529≡529-18*29=529-522=7 mod29. Then 20^4 +1=7 +1=8 mod29. So, 20^4 +1≡8 mod29≠0. Therefore, 20 is not a solution mod29². Therefore, maybe there is no solution for 29. But this contradicts the problem statement. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in calculating 20^4 mod29².

Wait, let's compute 20^2=400. 400 mod29²=400 mod841=400. Then 20^4=(400)^2=160000. Now, divide 160000 by841. Let's see:

841*189=841*(200-11)=168200 -9251=168200-9251=158949. Then 160000 -158949=1051. 1051 divided by841=1*841=841, remainder 210. So 160000≡210 mod841. Then 20^4 +1=211 mod841. So, 20^4 +1≡211 mod841≠0. So, 20 is not a solution.

Therefore, maybe 29 is not such a prime. But the problem says there exists such a prime. So, perhaps my earlier assumption that 20 is a solution was wrong. Therefore, maybe the next prime to check is 13.

Wait, but 13 is smaller than 29, so if 13 works, then 29 wouldn't be the least prime. Therefore, maybe I made a mistake in checking previous primes. Let's go back.

Wait, maybe I need to check higher primes. Let's check p=13.

Wait, 13 is less than 17,19,23,29. But if 13 is a prime where there's an n with n^4 +1 divisible by13²=169. Let's check if such an n exists.

First, check if there's an n with n^4 ≡-1 mod13. Then, lift it to mod13² using Hensel's lemma if possible.

First, check mod13. Let's solve n^4 ≡12 mod13.

Compute n^4 mod13 for n=1 to 12.

1^4=1
2^4=16≡3
3^4=81≡3
4^4=256≡256-19*13=256-247=9
5^4=625≡625-48*13=625-624=1

7^4=2401≡2401-184*13=2401-2392=9
8^4=4096≡4096-315*13=4096-4095=1
9^4=6561≡6561-504*13=6561-6552=9
10^4=10000≡10000-769*13=10000-9997=3
11^4=14641≡14641-1126*13=14641-14638=3
12^4=20736≡20736-1595*13=20736-20735=1

Wait, so n=1:1, n=2:3, n=3:3, n=4:9, n=5:1, n=6:9, n=7:9, n=8:1, n=9:9, n=10:3, n=11:3, n=12:1.

So, n^4 mod13 can be 1,3,9. So, there is no n where n^4≡12 mod13. Therefore, there is no solution mod13. Therefore, 13 is out.

But wait, earlier we thought p=29 was the answer, but maybe 17 is smaller. So, let's check if p=17 is the least prime.

</Plan_6>

<Execution_6>
<execution_6.1>
First, check if there's a prime less than 17. The primes less than 17 are 2,3,5,7,11,13. We already checked 2,3,5,7,11,13. For 2,3,5,7,11,13, we saw either no solutions or that n^4 +1 can't be divisible by their squares. For 17, we found a solution. Therefore, p=17 is the least prime.

Wait, but the problem states that the least prime p is such that there's a positive integer n with n^4 +1 divisible by p². Then, find the least positive integer m with m^4 +1 divisible by p². So, if p=17, then m is the smallest positive integer such that m^4 +1 is divisible by 17²=289.

But wait, the problem says "Find the least positive integer m such that m^4 +1 is divisible by p²". So, once p is found (which is 17), then m is the smallest positive integer with m^4 +1≡0 mod289. So, once we know p=17, we need to find the minimal m.

But how do we find the minimal m? Since we know that n=2 mod17 is a solution to n^4≡-1 mod17, we can lift this solution to mod289 using Hensel's lemma. Let's try that.

Let’s use Hensel's lemma to lift the solution from mod17 to mod17²=289. We have f(n)=n^4 +1. We know that f(2)=16 +1=17≡0 mod17. The derivative f’(n)=4n³. At n=2, f’(2)=4*8=32≡15 mod17. Since 15≡-2 mod17, which is not 0 mod17, so Hensel's lemma tells us there's a unique lift. Therefore, the solution can be lifted to mod289.

Let’s denote the solution as n=2 +17k. Then, substitute into f(n)=0 mod289:

(2 +17k)^4 +1 ≡0 mod289.

Let’s expand (2 +17k)^4 using the binomial theorem:

=2^4 + 4*2^3*(17k) + 6*2^2*(17k)^2 + 4*2*(17k)^3 + (17k)^4

But since we're working mod289=17², any term with (17k)^2 or higher power will be 0 mod289. So, we can ignore those terms. Therefore,

(2 +17k)^4 ≡2^4 +4*2^3*17k mod289
=16 + 4*8*17k mod289
=16 + 544k mod289

But 544 mod289: 289*1=289, 544-289=255, 255-289=-34≡255 mod289. Wait, 544 divided by289: 289*1=289, 544-289=255. 255 is less than289, so 544≡255 mod289. Wait, but 255=289-34=255, so 544≡255 mod289.

But wait, 544=2*272=2*16*17=32*17. So, 544k=32*17k. So, mod289=17², 32*17k=544k≡544k -17*(32k)=544k -544k=0 mod289. Wait, no, 544=17*32, so 544k=17*32k. Since we are mod17², 17*32k≡0 mod17² only if 32k≡0 mod17. But 32≡15 mod17, so 15k≡0 mod17. Therefore, k≡0 mod17. Therefore, the term 544k is 17*32k=17*(15k + something). Wait, maybe I need to compute 544 mod289:

544 ÷289=1*289=289, remainder 544-289=255. So 544≡255 mod289. Therefore, 255k mod289. Therefore, the expansion is:

(2 +17k)^4 ≡16 +255k mod289.

Set this equal to -1 mod289:

16 +255k ≡-1 mod289

So, 255k ≡-17 mod289.

Simplify 255k ≡-17 mod289.

But 255 ≡255 -289= -34 mod289. So, -34k ≡-17 mod289.

Multiply both sides by -1: 34k ≡17 mod289.

Divide both sides by17: 2k≡1 mod17.

So, 2k≡1 mod17. Multiply both sides by the inverse of 2 mod17, which is 9, since 2*9=18≡1 mod17.

Therefore, k≡9*1≡9 mod17. So, k=9 +17m for some integer m.

Therefore, the solution is n=2 +17k=2 +17*(9 +17m)=2 +153 +289m=155 +289m. Therefore, the minimal positive integer m is 155. So, m=155.

Wait, but let me check if 155^4 +1 is divisible by289.

As before, expanding this, we can see that the linear term is 4*2^3*17*9=4*8*17*9=2304. Then 2304 mod289: 289*7=2023, 2304-2023=281, 281-289=-8. So, 2304≡-8 mod289. Then, 155^4≡16 + (-8)=8 mod289. Then 155^4 +1≡8 +1=9≡9 mod289≠0. Wait, that contradicts. What's wrong here?

<execution_7.1>
Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's recompute 155 mod17=2, so 155=2 +17*9. Then, (2 +17*9)^4. Expanding this:

=2^4 + 4*2^3*(17*9) + 6*2^2*(17*9)^2 + 4*2*(17*9)^3 + (17*9)^4

But modulo289=17², terms with (17*9)^2 or higher are 0 mod289. So, only the first two terms matter:

=16 + 4*8*(17*9) mod289

=16 + 32*(153) mod289

Compute 32*153: 32*150=4800, 32*3=96, total=4896. Now, 4896 divided by289: 289*16=4624, 4896-4624=272. So, 32*153=4896≡272 mod289. Therefore, 16 +272=288≡-1 mod289. Therefore, 155^4≡-1 mod289. Therefore, 155^4 +1≡0 mod289. So, m=155 is a solution. Therefore, the minimal m is 155.

Based on execution_7.1:
Wait, but how did we get m=155? Because when we lifted the solution from mod17 to mod289, we found that k=9 mod17, so k=9 +17m. Then n=2 +17k=2 +17*(9 +17m)=2 +153 +289m=155 +289m. Therefore, the minimal positive solution is 155. Therefore, m=155.

But wait, earlier when we tried m=20, we saw that 20^4 +1=160001≡211 mod841≠0. So, 20 isn't a solution. So, the minimal m is indeed 155.
