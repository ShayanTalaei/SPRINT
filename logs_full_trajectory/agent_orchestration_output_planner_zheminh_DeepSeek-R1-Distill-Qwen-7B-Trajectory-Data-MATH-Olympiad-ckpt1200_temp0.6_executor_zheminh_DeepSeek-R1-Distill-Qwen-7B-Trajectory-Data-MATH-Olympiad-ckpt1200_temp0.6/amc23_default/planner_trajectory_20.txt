<Question>
Janet rolls a standard $6$-sided die $4$ times and keeps a running total of the numbers she rolls. What is the probability that at some point, her running total will equal $3$? The final answer can be written in the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

<Plan_1>
Okay, so Janet is rolling a standard 6-sided die four times, and she's keeping a running total of the numbers she rolls. We need to find the probability that at some point during those four rolls, her total equals 3. Then express that probability as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and find m + n. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.

First, let me understand the problem. She rolls the die four times, each time adding the result to her total. We need to find the probability that at least once during these four rolls, the total is exactly 3. For example, after the first roll, the total is 3, or after the second, third, or fourth roll. So the running total could hit 3 at any of those points.

To find this probability, maybe it's easier to calculate the total number of possible sequences of four die rolls and then subtract the number of sequences where the running total never equals 3. Then the probability would be 1 minus the ratio of those two numbers.

The total number of possible sequences is 6^4, since each roll is independent and has 6 possible outcomes.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to model this using recursion or dynamic programming. Let me see.

Suppose we want to count the number of sequences where the running total never reaches 3. Let’s denote by f(k, s) the number of sequences of k rolls where the running total never equals 3 and the current total after k rolls is s. Then, the total number we need is f(4, s) for all s ≠ 3, summed over all possible s.

<prompt_1.2> Define a recursive function to count sequences where the running total never reaches 3. </prompt_1.2>
-----

Alternatively, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let’s consider the events A1, A2, A3, A4, where Ai is the event that the running total after the i-th roll is 3. We need to compute the probability of A1 ∪ A2 ∪ A3 ∪ A4. By inclusion-exclusion, this is equal to the sum of probabilities of Ai minus the sum of probabilities of intersections of two Ai's plus the sum of intersections of three Ai's, and so on.

<prompt_1.3> Use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to approximate the probability. </prompt_1.3>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
That's straightforward. So 6*6*6*6 = 1296 total possible outcomes.

Now, the tricky part is figuring out how many sequences never have a running total of 3. Let's denote that number as N. Then the probability we want is (1296 - N)/1296.
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
Wait, actually, f(k, s) would be the number of sequences of k rolls where the running total never hits 3, and after k rolls, the total is s. Then, the total number of such sequences is the sum over s ≠ 3 of f(4, s). Then, the probability we want is 1 - (sum f(4, s) for s ≠ 3)/6^4.

But building this recursively might be a bit involved, but let's try.

First, for k = 0, f(0, 0) = 1 (no rolls, total is 0), and f(0, s) = 0 for s ≠ 0.

For k = 1, f(1, s) is the number of sequences of 1 roll where the running total is s and s ≠ 3. Since each roll is 1-6, f(1, s) = 1 if s ∈ {1,2,4,5,6}, and 0 if s = 3. So there are 5 possibilities here.

For k = 2, f(2, s) is the sum over all possible previous totals s' ≠ 3 and current roll d such that s' + d = s. So for each s, f(2, s) = sum_{d=1}^6 f(1, s - d) if s - d ≠ 3.

Similarly, for k = 3 and k = 4, we can build up f(k, s) recursively, making sure that at each step, we never add a roll that would make the total equal to 3.

But this seems a bit tedious, but maybe manageable.
</execution_1.2>

<execution_1.3>
However, inclusion-exclusion can get complicated because the events are not independent. For example, if the running total after the first roll is 3, then the running total after the second roll can't be 3 again unless the second roll is 0, which isn't possible. Wait, but even if the first roll is 3, the second roll can't be negative, so the total after the second roll is at least 3. So actually, once the total reaches 3, it can't go back down. Therefore, the events Ai are nested: if the total reaches 3 at step i, then it can reach 3 again at a later step. Wait, no. If you reach 3 at step i, then the total at step i+1 is at least 3 + 1 = 4, so you can't reach 3 again. Similarly, if you reach 3 at step i, you can't reach 3 at step j > i. So the events Ai are mutually exclusive in the sense that once you hit 3 at step i, you can't hit it again. Therefore, the probability of the union is just the sum of the probabilities of each Ai.

Wait, is that true? Let me check. Suppose she rolls a 3 on the first roll, then her total is 3. Then, on the second roll, even if she rolls a 0 (which isn't possible), but since die rolls are at least 1, the total after the second roll is at least 3 + 1 = 4. So once you hit 3, you can't hit it again. So the events Ai are indeed mutually exclusive. Therefore, the probability that she hits 3 at some point is just the sum over i=1 to 4 of the probability that she hits 3 at the i-th roll.

But wait, is that correct? Let me think again. Suppose she doesn't hit 3 at the first roll, but hits it at the second roll. Then, the first roll must have been a number that doesn't make the total 3, and the second roll adds up with the first to 3. For example, first roll is 1, second is 2. Then total after first roll is 1, after second is 3. Similarly, first roll is 2, second is 1. So those are possible. So even if she doesn't hit 3 in the first roll, she can hit it in the second. So the events Ai are not mutually exclusive in the sense that hitting 3 at the second roll doesn't depend on not hitting it in the first. But in reality, if she didn't hit 3 in the first roll, she could still hit it in the second. So the events are not mutually exclusive. Therefore, the inclusion-exclusion principle is necessary.

But this seems complicated because the events are not independent. So maybe the first approach of calculating total sequences minus sequences where total never reaches 3 is better.

Based on execution_1.1:
So we need to compute N, the number of sequences where the running total never equals 3. Then subtract N from 1296 and divide by 1296 to get the probability.

To compute N, we can model this as a state machine where each state represents the current total, and we want to count the number of paths of length 4 that never visit the state 3.

<prompt_2.1> Plan to compute N by considering the state machine approach. </prompt_2.1>

Based on execution_1.2:
Let's see. Let's build a table for f(k, s) for k from 0 to 4 and s from 0 to 24 (since the maximum total after 4 rolls is 24).

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Wait, no, actually, each die roll can add 1 through 6 to the total. So the states are the possible totals, and transitions are adding 1 to 6. But we need to avoid the state 3 at any point.

But since we're starting at 0, the initial state is 0. Then each subsequent state is the previous state plus the die roll. But we need to ensure that none of the intermediate states (after 1 roll, after 2 rolls, etc. ) are equal to 3.

So this is similar to a constrained walk on the integers where we start at 0, take steps of 1-6, and never visit 3. How many such walks of length 4 are there?

This seems like a problem that can be solved with recursion or dynamic programming. Let's try to model it.

Let’s define f(n, s) as the number of sequences of n rolls where the running total after each roll never equals 3, and the total after n rolls is s. Then, the total number N is the sum over s ≠ 3 of f(4, s).

We need to compute f(4, s) for all s ≠ 3 and sum them up.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Starting with k=0:

- f(0, 0) = 1
- f(0, s) = 0 for s ≠ 0

For k=1:

- For each possible die roll (1-6), the total is that number. But we can't have a total of 3. So for each s in 1-6, except 3, f(1, s) = 1 if s ≠ 3, else 0. So f(1, 1)=1, f(1,2)=1, f(1,3)=0, f(1,4)=1, f(1,5)=1, f(1,6)=1. So 5 possibilities here.

For k=2:

Now, for each possible previous total s' (from 0 to 6, since k=1) that didn't reach 3, and each possible die roll d (1-6), we add to f(2, s' + d) the number of ways f(1, s'). But we have to make sure that s' + d ≠ 3.

Wait, but actually, we have to consider that in k=2, the total can be from 2 to 12 (since two dice rolls). But we need to exclude any sequences where at any point (after 1 or 2 rolls) the total was 3. So even if the total after two rolls is not 3, we have to check if any of the partial sums (after 1 or 2 rolls) was 3. Wait, but in k=2, the total after 1 roll is s', and after 2 rolls is s' + d. So in order for the running total to never reach 3, we need s' ≠ 3 and s' + d ≠ 3. But s' can't be 3, but s' + d could be 3 if s' = 2 and d = 1. So we need to ensure that neither s' nor s' + d is 3.

Therefore, when building f(2, s), we have to consider that the previous total s' (after 1 roll) was not 3, and the current total s' + d is also not 3.

So for k=2:

For each s' in 0 to 6 (from k=1), if s' ≠ 3, and for each die roll d=1 to 6:

- If s' + d ≠ 3, then f(2, s' + d) += f(1, s')

So let's compute f(2, s) for each possible s:

Possible s after 2 rolls: 2 to 12.

But we need to exclude any s where s' + d = 3. Since s' can be from 0 to 6 (but s' ≠ 3). So possible s' values are 0,1,2,4,5,6.

For each s' in {0,1,2,4,5,6}, and d=1-6:

- If s' + d ≠ 3, then add f(1, s') to f(2, s' + d).

Let's compute this step by step.

First, s' can be 0,1,2,4,5,6.

For s' = 0:

- d=1: 0+1=1 ≠3 → f(2,1) += f(1,0) = 1
- d=2: 0+2=2 ≠3 → f(2,2) +=1

Now, let's sum up all these contributions for each s:

Starting with s=1:

- Only from s'=0, d=1: 1
- Total: 1

s=2:

- From s'=0, d=2: 1
- From s'=1, d=1: 1
- Total: 2

s=3: Not possible, since s' can't be 3, and s' + d can't be 3.

s=4:

- From s'=0, d=4: 1
- From s'=1, d=3: 1
- From s'=2, d=2: 1
- From s'=4, d=1: 1
- Total: 4

s=5:

- From s'=0, d=5: 1
- From s'=1, d=4: 1
- From s'=2, d=3: 1
- From s'=4, d=2: 1
- From s'=5, d=1: 1
- Total: 5

s=6:

- From s'=0, d=6: 1
- From s'=1, d=5: 1
- From s'=2, d=4: 1
- From s'=4, d=3: 1
- From s'=5, d=2: 1
- From s'=6, d=1: 1
- Total: 6

s=7:

- From s'=1, d=6:1
- From s'=2, d=5:1
- From s'=4, d=4:1
- From s'=5, d=3:1
- From s'=6, d=2:1
- Total:5

s=8:

- From s'=2, d=6:1
- From s'=4, d=5:1
- From s'=5, d=4:1
- From s'=6, d=3:1
- Total:4

s=9:

- From s'=4, d=6:1
- From s'=5, d=5:1
- From s'=6, d=4:1
- Total:3

s=10:

- From s'=5, d=6:1
- From s'=6, d=5:1
- Total:2

s=11:

- From s'=6, d=6:1
- Total:1

s=12:

- From s'=6, d=6:1
- Total:1

Wait, let me check these totals again. Let me list them:

- s=1: 1
- s=2: 2
- s=4: 4
- s=5: 5
- s=6: 6
- s=7: 5
- s=8: 4
- s=9: 3
- s=10: 2
- s=11:1
- s=12:1

Wait, but s=3 and s=13-24 are excluded because s' + d can't be 3, and after k=2, the maximum total is 12, so higher than that isn't possible.

Therefore, f(2, s) is as above for s=1,2,4-12. The total number of sequences for k=2 is the sum of f(2, s) over all s, which should be equal to 5*5=25 (since each die roll has 5 possibilities that don't lead to 3). Wait, but let's check:

Sum of f(2, s):

1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 6 +5 +4 +3 +2 +1 +1 = Let's compute step by step:

1 + 2 = 3

3 + 4 =7

7 +5=12

12 +6=18

18 +5=23

23 +4=27

27 +3=30

30 +2=32

32 +1=33

33 +1=34

Wait, that sums to 34. But since k=2, there are 6^2=36 possible sequences. But we excluded sequences where the total after the first or second roll is 3. So the number of sequences where total never reaches 3 after 2 rolls is 34. Therefore, N (for k=2) is 34. But 34 is less than 36, which makes sense.

Based on execution_2.1:
s=1:1, s=2:2, s=4:4, s=5:5, s=6:6, s=7:5, s=8:4, s=9:3, s=10:2, s=11:1, s=12:1.

So f(2, s) = [1,2,0,4,5,6,0,5,4,3,2,1,1] for s=0 to 12. Wait, actually, s=0 is not possible here because the first die roll is at least 1, so after two rolls, the minimum is 2.

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Now, moving to k=3. For each previous total s' (from k=2, which are s=1,2,4-12), we need to add die rolls d=1-6 such that s' + d ≠ 3 and s' + d ≠ 3. Wait, but since s' is at least 1 (from k=2), adding d=1 would make s' + d ≥ 2. So s' + d can't be 3 unless s' = 2 and d=1. But we already excluded s' + d =3 in the previous step. So for k=3, we need to ensure that after three rolls, the total is not 3, and also that after two rolls, it wasn't 3. Wait, but we already ensured that after two rolls, the total isn't 3. So for k=3, we need to make sure that the total after three rolls isn't 3, given that the previous totals were already not 3.

So for k=3:

For each s' in {1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12}, and d=1-6:

- If s' + d ≠ 3, then f(3, s' + d) += f(2, s')

But since s' is at least 1, s' + d can be 3 only if s' = 2 and d=1. But we already excluded s' =2 in k=2. Wait, no. Wait, in k=2, we have s' as the total after two rolls, which are 1,2,4-12. So s' can be 1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12. So s' =2 is allowed in k=2, but when we add d=1, s' + d =3, which is excluded. So for k=3, we need to exclude any transitions that would lead to total 3.

Therefore, for each s' in {1,2,4-12}, and d=1-6:

- If s' + d ≠3, then add f(2, s') to f(3, s' + d)

But specifically, when s' =2 and d=1, we have to exclude that transition. Similarly, other s' values can't lead to 3 because they are already ≥1, and d is at least 1, so s' + d ≥1 +1=2, but s' can be 2, which with d=1 would be 3.

So let's compute f(3, s):

Initialize f(3, s) =0 for all s.

For each s' in {1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12}:

For each d=1-6:

- If s' + d ≠3, then f(3, s' + d) += f(2, s')

So let's go through each s':

Wait, but die rolls only go up to 6, so the maximum total after 3 rolls is 18, but we're only concerned up to 12. However, since we're tracking totals up to 12, we can cap it at 12, but actually, for the purposes of the DP, we can ignore totals beyond 12 because Janet only rolls four times, so maximum total is 24, but since we're tracking up to 12 for k=3, and beyond that for k=4, but wait, no. Wait, actually, for k=3, the possible totals can go up to 18 (6*3), but since we need to track totals up to 12 for k=4. But perhaps it's better to track up to 12 for all k.

Wait, maybe I should adjust the DP to track totals up to 24 for all k, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, since we're only concerned with totals up to 24, we can ignore totals beyond that. But for the sake of this problem, since Janet only rolls four times, the maximum total after four rolls is 24, but we only need to track up to 24. However, since we're calculating N as the number of sequences where the total never reaches 3 at any point, including after the first, second, third, or fourth rolls. Therefore, for each k, we need to ensure that the total after each roll is not 3. So for k=3, we need to make sure that the total after three rolls isn't 3, given that after two rolls, it wasn't 3. Similarly for k=4.

But perhaps it's getting too complicated. Let's proceed step by step.

Continuing:

s'=8:

- d=1: 8+1=9 ≠3 → f(3,9) +=1
- d=2: 8+2=10 ≠3 → f(3,10) +=1
- d=3: 8+3=11 ≠3 → f(3,11) +=1
- d=4: 8+4=12 ≠3 → f(3,12) +=1
- d=5: 8+5=13 → ignore
- d=6: 8+6=14 → ignore

So s'=8 contributions:
- f(3,9) +=1
- f(3,10) +=1
- f(3,11) +=1
- f(3,12) +=1

s'=9:

- d=1:9+1=10 ≠3 → f(3,10) +=1
- d=2:9+2=11 ≠3 → f(3,11) +=1
- d=3:9+3=12 ≠3 → f(3,12) +=1
- d=4:9+4=13 → ignore
- d=5:9+5=14 → ignore
- d=6:9+6=15 → ignore

s'=9 contributions:
- f(3,10) +=1
- f(3,11) +=1
- f(3,12) +=1

s'=10:

- d=1:10+1=11 ≠3 → f(3,11) +=1
- d=2:10+2=12 ≠3 → f(3,12) +=1
- d=3:10+3=13 → ignore
- d=4:10+4=14 → ignore
- d=5:10+5=15 → ignore
- d=6:10+6=16 → ignore

s'=10 contributions:
- f(3,11) +=1
- f(3,12) +=1

s'=11:

- d=1:11+1=12 ≠3 → f(3,12) +=1
- d=2:11+2=13 → ignore
- d=3:11+3=14 → ignore
- d=4:11+4=15 → ignore
- d=5:11+5=16 → ignore
- d=6:11+6=17 → ignore

s'=11 contributions:
- f(3,12) +=1

s'=12:

- d=1:12+1=13 → ignore
- d=2:12+2=14 → ignore
- d=3:12+3=15 → ignore
- d=4:12+4=16 → ignore
- d=5:12+5=17 → ignore
- d=6:12+6=18 → ignore

s'=12 contributions:
- None

Now, let's sum up all contributions for each s:

Starting with s=1:

- Only from s'=1, d=1:1

s=2:

- Only from s'=1, d=2:1

s=4:

- From s'=1, d=4:1
- From s'=2, d=2:1
- From s'=4, d=1:1
- Total:4

s=5:

- From s'=1, d=5:1
- From s'=2, d=3:1
- From s'=4, d=2:1
- From s'=5, d=1:1
- Total:5

s=6:

- From s'=1, d=6:1
- From s'=2, d=4:1
- From s'=4, d=3:1
- From s'=5, d=2:1
- From s'=6, d=1:1
- Total:5

s=7:

- From s'=1, d=6:1
- From s'=2, d=5:1
- From s'=4, d=4:1
- From s'=5, d=3:1
- From s'=6, d=2:1
- Total:5

s=8:

- From s'=1, d=6:1
- From s'=2, d=4:1
- From s'=4, d=5:1
- From s'=5, d=4:1
- From s'=6, d=3:1
- Total:5

s=9:

- From s'=2, d=6:1
- From s'=4, d=6:1
- From s'=5, d=5:1
- From s'=6, d=4:1
- Total:4

s=10:

- From s'=2, d=6:1
- From s'=4, d=6:1
- From s'=5, d=6:1
- From s'=6, d=5:1
- Total:4

s=11:

- From s'=4, d=6:1
- From s'=5, d=6:1
- From s'=6, d=6:1
- Total:3

s=12:

- From s'=1, d=6:1
- From s'=2, d=6:1
- From s'=4, d=6:1
- From s'=5, d=6:1
- From s'=6, d=6:1
- Total:5

So f(3, s) is as follows:

s=1:1

s=2:1

s=4:4

s=5:5

s=6:5

s=7:5

s=8:5

s=9:4

s=10:4

s=11:3

s=12:5

Now, sum these up to get total N for k=3:

1 +1 +4 +5 +5 +5 +5 +4 +4 +3 +5 = Let's compute step by step:

1 +1 =2

2 +4=6

6 +5=11

11 +5=16

16 +5=21

21 +5=26

26 +4=30

30 +4=34

34 +3=37

37 +5=42

So f(3, s) sums to 42. Therefore, N for k=3 is 42.

<Final_answer>
The probability is $\boxed{\frac{35}{36}}$, so $m+n = 35 + 36 = \boxed{71}$.
