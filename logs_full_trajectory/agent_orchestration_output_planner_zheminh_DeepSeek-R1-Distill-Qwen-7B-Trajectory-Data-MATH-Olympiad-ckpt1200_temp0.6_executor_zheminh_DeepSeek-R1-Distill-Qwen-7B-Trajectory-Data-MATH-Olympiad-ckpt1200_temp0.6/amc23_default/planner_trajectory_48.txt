How many nonempty subsets $B$ of ${0, 1, 2, 3, \cdots, 12}$ have the property that the number of elements in $B$ is equal to the least element of $B$? For example, $B = {4, 6, 8, 11}$ satisfies the condition.

Okay, so I need to figure out how many nonempty subsets B of the set {0, 1, 2, 3, ...., 12} satisfy the condition that the number of elements in B is equal to the least element of B. Let me start by understanding the problem properly.

<prompt_1.1> Understand the problem statement and clarify the condition that the number of elements in B equals the least element of B. </prompt_1.1>

First, the set given is {0, 1, 2, ...., 12}, which has 13 elements. A subset B is nonempty, so it must have at least one element. The condition is that the size of B (which is the number of elements in B) is equal to the smallest element in B. For example, they gave an example where B = {4, 6, 8, 11}, which has 4 elements, and the least element is 4. That works. So I need to count all such subsets where this condition holds.

Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can consider each possible least element k, and then count how many subsets have k as the smallest element and have exactly k elements. Then sum over all possible k. That makes sense. But what are the possible values of k? Since the least element has to be equal to the size of the subset, and the size of the subset must be at least 1 (since it's nonempty), the least element k must be at least 1. Also, the maximum possible size of the subset is 13 (the whole set), but since the least element can't be more than 12 (since the set goes up to 12), the maximum k is 12. However, can k be 12? Let's check.

If k = 12, then the subset must have 12 elements, and the smallest element is 12. But wait, the smallest element is 12, so all elements must be 12 or larger. But in the original set, the elements are 0, 1, ...., 12. So the only element that's 12 or larger is 12 itself. Therefore, the subset can only contain 12. But to have 12 elements, you need 12 distinct elements, but there's only one element (12) that's equal to or larger than 12. Therefore, it's impossible to have a subset of size 12 where the least element is 12. So k can't be 12. Similarly, maybe k can't be 11 either? Let's check.

If k = 11, then the subset must have 11 elements, and the smallest element is 11. So the subset would have to include 11 and then 10 other elements, all of which are greater than or equal to 11. But the elements greater than or equal to 11 in the original set are 11 and 12. So there are only two elements (11 and 12) that are >=11. Therefore, if we need a subset of size 11, starting with 11, we can only have 11 and 12, which is only 2 elements. But 2 is less than 11, so that's impossible. Therefore, k can't be 11 either. Hmm, so maybe there's a maximum k beyond which it's impossible.

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Let me see. Let's denote k as the least element and also the size of the subset. So for each k, we need to have a subset of size k, with the smallest element being k. So the elements of the subset must be {k, a1, a2, ...., a_{k-1} }, where each ai > k. Therefore, the ai's must be chosen from the elements greater than k, which are {k+1, k+2, ...., 12}.

<prompt_2.1> Determine the possible values of k such that the subset of size k with least element k is possible. </prompt_2.1>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
The number of elements available for choosing the ai's is (12 - k). Because from k+1 up to 12, there are 12 - k elements. So we need to choose (k - 1) elements from these (12 - k) elements. Therefore, the number of subsets for each k is C(12 - k, k - 1). But this is only possible if (12 - k) >= (k - 1), otherwise, we can't choose (k - 1) elements. So let's solve the inequality:

12 - k >= k - 1

12 + 1 >= k + k

13 >= 2k

So k <= 6.5. Since k is an integer, k <= 6. Therefore, k can be from 1 to 6. Wait, but earlier I thought k=12 is impossible, but according to this, k can go up to 6. Let me check with k=6.

If k=6, then the subset must have 6 elements, with the smallest element being 6. So the elements are {6, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5}, where each ai >6. The available elements are 7,8,9,10,11,12. That's 6 elements. So we need to choose 5 elements from these 6 elements. The number of subsets would be C(6,5)=6. Similarly, for k=5, elements greater than 5 are 6,7,8,9,10,11,12. That's 7 elements. We need to choose 4 elements from them. So C(7,4)=35. For k=4, elements greater than 4 are 5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12. That's 8 elements. We need to choose 3 elements. C(8,3)=56. For k=3, elements greater than 3 are 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12. That's 9 elements. We need to choose 2 elements. C(9,2)=36. For k=2, elements greater than 2 are 3,4,....,12. That's 10 elements. We need to choose 1 element. C(10,1)=10. For k=1, elements greater than 1 are 2,3,....,12. That's 11 elements. We need to choose 0 elements (since k-1=0). C(11,0)=1. So adding all these up: 1 + 10 + 36 + 56 + 35 + 6 = let's compute step by step.

1 + 10 = 11

11 + 36 = 47

47 + 56 = 103

103 + 35 = 138

138 + 6 = 144.

Based on execution_2.1:
Wait, but let me verify this. Let's check each k again to make sure.

<prompt_3.1> Verify the calculation for each k from 1 to 6 to ensure the counts are correct. </prompt_3.1>

Based on execution_2.1, execution_3.1:
Therefore, the total number of such subsets is 144.

But wait, let me check k=6 again. For k=6, the subset must have 6 elements starting with 6, and the other 5 elements must be chosen from {7,8,9,10,11,12}. There are 6 elements, so choosing 5 is 6 subsets. That's correct.

Similarly, for k=5, elements greater than 5 are 6 to 12, which is 7 elements. Choosing 4 elements from 7: C(7,4)=35. Correct.

<prompt_3.2> Verify the total sum of subsets for each k and confirm the final answer. </prompt_3.2>

But wait, let me check if there's a different approach. For example, maybe considering all possible subsets where the size equals the minimal element. Let's see.

<prompt_3.3> Consider an alternative approach to verify the solution and conclude the answer. </prompt_3.3>

But wait, let me check with k=6. If k=6, the subset has 6 elements, starting with 6, and then 5 elements from 7-12. So yes, 6 elements. So the count is 6. Similarly, for k=5, 5 elements, starting with 5, and 4 elements from 6-12, which is 7 elements. So C(7,4)=35. Correct.

<prompt_3.4> Perform a final verification of the counts for each k and confirm the solution. </prompt_3.4>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
For k=1: The subset must have 1 element, which is 1. So the only subset is {1}, which satisfies the condition. So 1 subset.

For k=2: The subset must have 2 elements, with the smallest being 2. So the elements are 2 and one other element from {3,4,....,12}. There are 10 elements greater than 2, so we need to choose 1 element from 10, which is C(10,1)=10. That seems correct.

For k=3: The subset must have 3 elements, starting with 3. The other two elements must be chosen from {4,5,....,12}, which are 9 elements. So C(9,2)=36. Correct.

For k=4: Starting with 4, need 4 elements total. So 3 elements from {5,6,....,12} (8 elements). C(8,3)=56. Correct.

For k=5: Starting with 5, need 5 elements total. So 4 elements from {6,7,....,12} (7 elements). C(7,4)=35. Correct.

For k=6: Starting with 6, need 6 elements total. So 5 elements from {7,8,....,12} (6 elements). C(6,5)=6. Correct.

So adding all these up: 1 + 10 + 36 + 56 + 35 + 6. Let's add them step by step:

1 + 10 = 11

11 + 36 = 47

47 + 56 = 103

103 + 35 = 138

138 + 6 = 144.

So the total number of subsets is 144.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
For k=4, elements greater than 4 are 5-12, which is 8 elements. Choosing 3: C(8,3)=56. Correct. For k=3, elements greater than 3 are 4-12, 9 elements, choosing 2: C(9,2)=36. Correct. k=2: elements greater than 2 are 3-12, 10 elements, choosing 1: C(10,1)=10. Correct. k=1: elements greater than 1 are 2-12, 11 elements, choosing 0: 1. Correct. So adding all these up: 1+10=11, 11+36=47, 47+56=103, 103+35=138, 138+6=144. So total 144 subsets.
</execution_3.2>

<execution_3.3>
Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or generating function. Let's see.

Alternatively, note that for each k from 1 to 6, the number of subsets is C(12 - k, k - 1). So the total number is sum_{k=1}^{6} C(12 - k, k - 1).

But let's compute that again:

For k=1: 12 -1=11, choose 0: C(11,0)=1

k=2: 12-2=10, choose 1: C(10,1)=10

k=3: 12-3=9, choose 2: C(9,2)=36

k=4: 12-4=8, choose 3: C(8,3)=56

k=5: 12-5=7, choose 4: C(7,4)=35

k=6: 12-6=6, choose 5: C(6,5)=6

Sum: 1 + 10 + 36 + 56 + 35 + 6 = 144.

Yes, same result. So the total number of subsets is 144.

But wait, let me check if there's any k beyond 6. For example, if k=7, then 12 -7=5, and we need to choose 6 elements (since k-1=6), but 5 <6, so impossible. Similarly, k=8: 12-8=4, need to choose 7 elements, which is impossible. So indeed, k can only go up to 6.

Therefore, the answer should be 144.
</execution_3.3>

<execution_3.4>
Similarly, for k=4, 4 elements starting with 4, then 3 elements from 5-12 (8 elements). C(8,3)=56. Correct. So adding all these gives 1 + 10 + 36 + 56 + 35 + 6 = 144. Hmm, but let me check if there's any mistake here. For example, when k=1, the subset must have 1 element, which is the smallest element. Since the smallest element is 1, the subset is {1}. But wait, the original set includes 0. So if the subset is {1}, then it's a subset with one element, which is 1. The smallest element is 1, which equals the size of the subset (1). So that's valid. So {1} is a valid subset. Similarly, {0} would be a subset of size 1, but the smallest element is 0, which is not equal to 1, so it's invalid. Therefore, only subsets starting with k=1 to k=6 are valid. So the count is indeed 1 + 10 + 36 + 56 + 35 + 6 = 144.

Wait, but let me check if there are any other k values. For example, k=0. But k=0 would mean the subset has 0 elements, which is not allowed since it's nonempty. So k starts at 1. So that's correct.
