Okay, so I need to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of four numbers a, b, c, d. All of them are positive integers, and they satisfy a bunch of least common multiple (lcm) conditions, along with their product abcd being equal to 2^6 * 3^9 * 5^7. Hmm, let me start by breaking down the problem step by step.

First, since the product of a, b, c, d is given, and their lcm conditions are given, maybe I can analyze each prime factor separately. Because gcd and lcm operations are multiplicative over prime factors, so I can handle each prime (2, 3, 5) independently and then combine the results.

Let me recall that for each prime, the exponent in the gcd of the numbers is the minimum exponent of that prime in each number, and the exponent in the lcm is the maximum exponent.

So, for each prime p, if I can find the minimum exponent across a, b, c, d, that will give me the exponent of p in gcd(a, b, c, d). Then, I can do this for primes 2, 3, and 5, and multiply them together to get the final gcd.

Let me start with prime 2.

<prompt_1.1> Analyze the prime factor 2 for the gcd of a, b, c, d. </prompt_1.1>

Moving on to prime 3.

<prompt_1.2> Analyze the prime factor 3 for the gcd of a, b, c, d. </prompt_1.2>

Now onto prime 5.

<prompt_1.3> Analyze the prime factor 5 for the gcd of a, b, c, d. </prompt_1.3>

<execution_1.1>
The exponents of 2 in the product abcd is 6. The lcm conditions for 2 are:

- lcm(a, b) has exponent 3
- lcm(a, c) has exponent 3
- lcm(a, d) has exponent 3
- lcm(b, c) has exponent 1
- lcm(b, d) has exponent 2
- lcm(c, d) has exponent 2

So, let's denote the exponents of 2 in a, b, c, d as a2, b2, c2, d2 respectively.

From the product, we have:

a2 + b2 + c2 + d2 = 6.

Now, the lcm conditions:

- max(a2, b2) = 3
- max(a2, c2) = 3
- max(a2, d2) = 3
- max(b2, c2) = 1
- max(b2, d2) = 2
- max(c2, d2) = 2

So, let's analyze these step by step.

First, from the last three lcm conditions (involving b, c, d):

max(b2, c2) = 1, so both b2 and c2 are ≤1, and at least one of them is 1.

Similarly, max(b2, d2) = 2, so at least one of b2 or d2 is 2. But since max(b2, c2) =1, b2 ≤1. Therefore, d2 must be 2 to satisfy max(b2, d2)=2. Because if d2 were ≤1, then max(b2, d2) ≤1, which contradicts the lcm being 2. Therefore, d2=2.

Similarly, max(c2, d2)=2. Since d2=2, regardless of c2, the max is 2. But from max(b2, c2)=1, c2 ≤1. So c2 can be 0 or 1, but since the lcm with b2 is 1, if c2 is 1, then b2 must be ≤1. If c2 is 0, then b2 must be 1. So c2 is either 0 or 1, and b2 is ≤1, with at least one of b2 or c2 being 1.

Now, going back to the first three lcm conditions:

max(a2, b2)=3

max(a2, c2)=3

max(a2, d2)=3

Since d2=2, max(a2, 2)=3, so a2 must be 3. Because if a2 were ≤2, then max(a2, 2) would be 2, which is less than 3. Therefore, a2=3.

So, a2=3. Then, from the first two lcm conditions:

max(3, b2)=3 ⇒ b2 ≤3

max(3, c2)=3 ⇒ c2 ≤3

But from the other conditions, we know b2 ≤1 and c2 ≤1 (since max(b2, c2)=1). Therefore, b2 and c2 are both ≤1, with at least one of them being 1.

So, summarizing exponents for 2:

a2=3

b2 ≤1, c2 ≤1, d2=2

And a2 + b2 + c2 + d2 =6 ⇒ 3 + b2 + c2 + 2 =6 ⇒ b2 + c2 =1.

Since b2 and c2 are non-negative integers (exponents), and their sum is 1. So possible pairs (b2, c2) are (1,0) or (0,1). But from the lcm conditions, at least one of b2 or c2 must be 1. So both possibilities are allowed.

Therefore, two cases:

Case 1: b2=1, c2=0

Case 2: b2=0, c2=1

Let me check both cases.

Case 1: b2=1, c2=0

Check max(b2, c2)=max(1,0)=1, which is correct.

max(b2, d2)=max(1,2)=2, correct.

max(c2, d2)=max(0,2)=2, correct.

Case 2: b2=0, c2=1

Check max(b2, c2)=max(0,1)=1, correct.

max(b2, d2)=max(0,2)=2, correct.

max(c2, d2)=max(1,2)=2, correct.

So both cases are possible. Therefore, we need to consider both possibilities.

The exponents of 3 in the lcm conditions:

lcm(a, b) has 3^2, so max(exponent in a, exponent in b) = 2

lcm(a, c) has 3^3, so max(a, c) = 3

lcm(a, d) has 3^3, so max(a, d) = 3

lcm(b, c) has 3^3, so max(b, c) = 3

lcm(b, d) has 3^3, so max(b, d) = 3

lcm(c, d) has 3^3, so max(c, d) = 3

So, let's denote the exponents of 3 in a, b, c, d as a_3, b_3, c_3, d_3 respectively.

From lcm(a, b): max(a_3, b_3) = 2

From lcm(a, c): max(a_3, c_3) = 3

From lcm(a, d): max(a_3, d_3) = 3

From lcm(b, c): max(b_3, c_3) = 3

From lcm(b, d): max(b_3, d_3) = 3

From lcm(c, d): max(c_3, d_3) = 3

Also, the product abcd has exponent of 3 equal to 9. So, a_3 + b_3 + c_3 + d_3 = 9.

We need to find min(a_3, b_3, c_3, d_3). Let's see.

From the lcm conditions, we can deduce some constraints.

First, since max(a_3, b_3) = 2, both a_3 and b_3 must be <= 2. Because if either was higher, the max would be higher. So a_3 <= 2, b_3 <= 2.

But then, looking at lcm(a, c): max(a_3, c_3) = 3. Since a_3 <= 2, then c_3 must be 3. Similarly, lcm(a, d) requires d_3 = 3. Similarly, lcm(b, c) requires c_3 = 3 (since b_3 <= 2), and lcm(b, d) requires d_3 = 3 (same reason). lcm(c, d) already has c_3 and d_3 both 3, so that's okay.

So, c_3 = 3 and d_3 = 3. Then, a_3 and b_3 are <= 2, but their sum with c_3 and d_3 is 9. So, a_3 + b_3 + 3 + 3 = 9 => a_3 + b_3 = 3.

But a_3 and b_3 are both <= 2. So the possible pairs (a_3, b_3) are (0, 3), (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 0). But wait, a_3 and b_3 must be <= 2. Therefore, the only possible pairs are (1, 2), (2, 1). Because 0 and 3 are excluded.

Wait, but 3 is not allowed for a_3 or b_3. So a_3 and b_3 can be 0, 1, or 2. But their sum must be 3. So possible combinations are (0, 3) invalid, (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 0) invalid. So only (1, 2) and (2, 1).

Therefore, either a_3 = 1 and b_3 = 2, or a_3 = 2 and b_3 = 1.

Now, let's check if these satisfy all lcm conditions.

Case 1: a_3 = 1, b_3 = 2

Then, max(a_3, b_3) = 2, which matches lcm(a, b) = 2^3 * 3^2 * 5^3. Wait, hold on, no. Wait, the exponent for 3 in lcm(a, b) is 2, which we already considered. So that's okay.

But then, for lcm(a, c): max(1, 3) = 3, which is correct. Similarly, lcm(a, d) is 3, which is correct. lcm(b, c): max(2, 3) = 3, which is correct. lcm(b, d): max(2, 3) = 3, correct. lcm(c, d): max(3, 3) = 3, correct.

So this case works.

Case 2: a_3 = 2, b_3 = 1

Similarly, max(a_3, b_3) = 2, which is okay. lcm(a, c): max(2, 3) = 3, which is okay. lcm(a, d): max(2, 3) = 3, okay. lcm(b, c): max(1, 3) = 3, okay. lcm(b, d): max(1, 3) = 3, okay. lcm(c, d): 3, okay.

So both cases are possible. Therefore, the exponents for 3 are either (a_3, b_3) = (1, 2) or (2, 1), and c_3 = d_3 = 3.

Therefore, in terms of gcd, the minimum exponent among a_3, b_3, c_3, d_3 is min(1, 2, 3, 3) = 1 or min(2, 1, 3, 3) = 1. Either way, the minimum is 1. So the exponent for 3 in gcd(a, b, c, d) is 1.

The lcm conditions for 5:

- lcm(a, b) = 2^3 * 3^2 * 5^3
- lcm(a, c) = 2^3 * 3^3 * 5^3
- lcm(a, d) = 2^3 * 3^3 * 5^3
- lcm(b, c) = 2^1 * 3^3 * 5^2
- lcm(b, d) = 2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2
- lcm(c, d) = 2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2

So, for prime 5, the exponents in the numbers a, b, c, d must be such that:

The maximum exponent in any pair is given by the lcm. Let's denote the exponents of 5 in a, b, c, d as w, x, y, z respectively.

From lcm(a, b) = 5^3: max(w, x) = 3

From lcm(a, c) = 5^3: max(w, y) = 3

From lcm(a, d) = 5^3: max(w, z) = 3

From lcm(b, c) = 5^2: max(x, y) = 2

From lcm(b, d) = 5^2: max(x, z) = 2

From lcm(c, d) = 5^2: max(y, z) = 2

So, we need to find exponents w, x, y, z such that:

1. max(w, x) = 3

2. max(w, y) = 3

3. max(w, z) = 3

4. max(x, y) = 2

5. max(x, z) = 2

6. max(y, z) = 2

Also, the product abcd = 2^6 * 3^9 * 5^7. So, the exponents of 5 in a, b, c, d must add up to 7. So, w + x + y + z = 7.

Let's analyze these conditions.

From conditions 4,5,6: max(x, y) = 2, max(x, z) = 2, max(y, z) = 2. This implies that x, y, z are all ≤ 2, and at least one of them is 2. Because if all were ≤1, then max(x, y) would be ≤1, which contradicts the lcm being 2. So, at least one of x, y, z is 2.

But from conditions 1,2,3: each of x, y, z must be ≤3 because max(w, x) = 3, etc. But since x, y, z are all ≤2 (from 4,5,6), then the max(w, x) = 3 implies that w must be 3. Similarly, w must be 3 because if w was less than 3, then max(w, x) would be x, which is ≤2, contradicting the lcm being 3. Therefore, w = 3.

So, w = 3. Then, conditions 1,2,3 become:

max(3, x) = 3 (which is always true, so no new info)

max(3, y) = 3

max(3, z) = 3

So, x, y, z can be anything as long as they are ≤2 (from 4,5,6). But we also have that x, y, z are ≤2 and at least one of them is 2 (since max(x, y) = 2, etc.).

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1, execution_1.2, execution_1.3:
Now, the product of the exponents for 5 is w + x + y + z = 7.

Since w = 3, then x + y + z = 4.

Given that x, y, z are non-negative integers, each ≤2, and at least one of them is 2.
Let me list all possible triples (x, y, z) where x, y, z ≤2, sum to 4, and at least one is 2.

Possible combinations:

<prompt_2.1> List all possible triples (x, y, z) for the exponents of 5 that satisfy the conditions. </prompt_2.1>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
- 2, 2, 0: sum 4

- 2, 1, 1: sum 4

- 2, 0, 2: same as first

- 1, 2, 1: same as second

- 1, 1, 2: same as second

But since x, y, z are ordered (they correspond to exponents in b, c, d), so the triples are:

(2, 2, 0), (2, 0, 2), (0, 2, 2), (2, 1, 1), (1, 2, 1), (1, 1, 2)

So six possibilities. Let's check each.

First, (2, 2, 0):

Then x=2, y=2, z=0.

Check conditions:

max(x, y) = max(2, 2) = 2: okay

max(x, z) = max(2, 0) = 2: okay

max(y, z) = max(2, 0) = 2: okay

So this works.

Second, (2, 0, 2):

x=2, y=0, z=2

max(x, y)=2, max(x, z)=2, max(y, z)=2: okay

Third, (0, 2, 2):

x=0, y=2, z=2

Same as above.

Fourth, (2, 1, 1):

x=2, y=1, z=1

max(x, y)=2, max(x, z)=2, max(y, z)=1: but wait, max(y, z)=1, but condition 6 requires max(y, z)=2. So this violates the condition. Therefore, this triple is invalid.

Similarly, (1, 2, 1):

x=1, y=2, z=1

max(x, y)=2, max(x, z)=1, which violates condition 5 (max(x, z)=2). So this is invalid.

Similarly, (1, 1, 2):

x=1, y=1, z=2

max(x, y)=1, which violates condition 4 (max(x, y)=2). So invalid.

Therefore, only the first three triples are valid: (2,2,0), (2,0,2), (0,2,2). Each of these corresponds to permutations where two of x, y, z are 2 and the third is 0. So, in each case, two of the numbers (b, c, d) have exponent 2 in 5, and one has exponent 0.
</execution_2.1>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Now, let's see how this affects the gcd.

The exponents for 5 in a, b, c, d are:

w=3, and then among x, y, z, two are 2 and one is 0.

Therefore, the exponents are:

a: 3

b: either 2, 2, or 0

c: same as b

d: same as b

So, the minimum exponent among a, b, c, d is min(3, 2, 2, 0) = 0. Wait, but that can't be right.

Wait, hold on. The gcd is the product of the minimum exponents for each prime. So for prime 5, the exponents in a, b, c, d are 3, 2, 2, 0. The minimum is 0. Therefore, the exponent of 5 in gcd(a, b, c, d) is 0. Therefore, 5^0 = 1.

Wait, but that would mean that the gcd doesn't have 5 as a factor. But is that possible?

Wait, but let's check again. If one of the numbers has exponent 0 in 5, then the gcd will have exponent 0 for 5. So, yes, if one of a, b, c, d is not divisible by 5, then the gcd won't have 5. But in our case, a has exponent 3, which is divisible by 5, but one of b, c, d has exponent 0, which is not divisible by 5. Therefore, the gcd will have 5^0 = 1.
So the exponent for 5 in gcd(a, b, c, d) is 0.
Therefore, the gcd is 2^1 * 3^1 * 5^0 = 2*3 = 6.

Wait, but let me confirm again. Because in the case where one of b, c, d has exponent 0, then the gcd will take the minimum exponent across all four numbers. Since a has exponent 3, b has 2, c has 2, d has 0. So the minimum is 0. Therefore, 5^0 is part of the gcd. So the gcd is 2^1 * 3^1 * 5^0 = 6. Therefore, the answer is 6.

Wait, but let me check if there's any mistake here. For example, is there a case where even if one of b, c, d has exponent 0, but maybe the gcd could still have 5?

No, because gcd takes the minimum exponent for each prime. If any number has exponent 0, then the gcd will have exponent 0. So, yes, 5^0 is correct.

But let me check again if all the lcm conditions are satisfied for each case.

Let's take one of the valid triples, say (2, 2, 0). So x=2, y=2, z=0. Then:

<prompt_4.1> Verify the lcm conditions for one of the valid triples for the exponents of 5. </prompt_4.1>

Similarly, the other triples would also satisfy the lcm conditions.

Therefore, the exponents for 5 in the gcd are 0, so the gcd doesn't include 5. Therefore, the gcd is 2^1 * 3^1 = 6.

lcm(c, d): max(y, z) = max(2, 0) = 2: correct.

All other lcm conditions are satisfied as well, since a has exponent 3, so lcm with any other number will be max(3, something) = 3 where needed, and for the other primes, we already considered their exponents.
