\[(1+2a)(2+2b)(2a+b) = 32ab?\]
</Question>

<think>
<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to find the number of ordered pairs of positive real numbers (a, b) that satisfy the equation (1 + 2a)(2 + 2b)(2a + b) = 32ab. Hmm, let's start by understanding what the equation is saying and how I can approach solving it.

First, since we're dealing with positive real numbers, all variables a and b are greater than zero. The equation is a product of three terms on the left side equal to 32ab. Maybe expanding the left side would help, but that might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to use substitution or apply inequalities like AM-GM to simplify things.

Let me first try expanding the left-hand side (LHS) to see if that can be simplified.

<prompt_1.1> Expand the left-hand side (LHS) of the equation (1 + 2a)(2 + 2b)(2a + b) and simplify as much as possible. </prompt_1.1>
-----

Wait, but before I conclude that there's only one ordered pair, maybe I should check if there are other solutions by considering different substitutions or approaches. Let me try another method.

Alternatively, let's consider substituting variables to reduce the equation to a single variable.

<prompt_1.2> Consider alternative substitutions to reduce the equation to a single variable and verify the solution. </prompt_1.2>

Alternatively, let's try to find if there's a symmetry or if variables can be swapped. Suppose we swap a and b, does the equation remain the same?

<prompt_1.3> Check if swapping variables a and b leaves the equation unchanged and analyze the implications. </prompt_1.3>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
Let's break it down step by step.

First, multiply the first two terms: (1 + 2a)(2 + 2b). Let's compute that:

(1)(2) + (1)(2b) + (2a)(2) + (2a)(2b) = 2 + 2b + 4a + 4ab.

So, the first two terms multiply to 2 + 2b + 4a + 4ab. Now, we need to multiply this result by the third term (2a + b). Let's do that:

[2 + 2b + 4a + 4ab] * (2a + b). Let's distribute each term in the first bracket over the second bracket.

First, multiply 2 by (2a + b): 4a + 2b.

Next, multiply 2b by (2a + b): 4ab + 2b².

Then, multiply 4a by (2a + b): 8a² + 4ab.

Finally, multiply 4ab by (2a + b): 8a²b + 4ab².

Now, let's add all these terms together:

4a + 2b + 4ab + 2b² + 8a² + 4ab + 8a²b + 4ab².

Combine like terms:

- Constant terms: None.
- Terms with a: 4a.
- Terms with b: 2b.
- Terms with ab: 4ab + 4ab = 8ab.
- Terms with a²: 8a².
- Terms with b²: 2b².
- Terms with a²b: 8a²b.
- Terms with ab²: 4ab².

So, the expanded LHS is:

8a² + 2b² + 4a + 2b + 8ab + 8a²b + 4ab².
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
Let me set x = 2a and y = 2b. Then, since a and b are positive, x and y are also positive. Let's rewrite the equation in terms of x and y.

Original equation: (1 + 2a)(2 + 2b)(2a + b) = 32ab

Substituting x = 2a and y = 2b:

First term: (1 + x)
Second term: (2 + y/2) = (4 + y)/2
Third term: (x + y/2) = (2x + y)/2

So the LHS becomes: (1 + x) * (4 + y)/2 * (2x + y)/2

Multiply them together: (1 + x)(4 + y)(2x + y) / 4

RHS: 32ab. Since x = 2a and y = 2b, then ab = (x/2)(y/2) = xy/4. Therefore, RHS is 32*(xy/4) = 8xy.

So the equation becomes:

(1 + x)(4 + y)(2x + y)/4 = 8xy

Multiply both sides by 4:

(1 + x)(4 + y)(2x + y) = 32xy

Hmm, this seems similar to the original equation but in terms of x and y. Maybe this substitution doesn't help much. Let's see if we can find another substitution.

Alternatively, let's take the original equation:

(1 + 2a)(2 + 2b)(2a + b) = 32ab

Divide both sides by ab (since a and b are positive, ab ≠ 0):

(1 + 2a)/a * (2 + 2b)/b * (2a + b) = 32

Simplify each term:

(1/a + 2) * (2/b + 2) * (2a + b) = 32

Hmm, this might not be directly helpful. Let me compute each term:
</execution_1.2>

<execution_1.3>
Let's see:

Original equation: (1 + 2a)(2 + 2b)(2a + b) = 32ab.

If we swap a and b, the equation becomes (1 + 2b)(2 + 2a)(2b + a) = 32ab. 

Which is the same as the original equation, so swapping a and b gives the same equation. Therefore, if (a, b) is a solution, then (b, a) is also a solution. However, in our previous analysis, we found a solution where a = 1 and b = 1, which is symmetric. So, in this case, swapping doesn't give a new solution. But maybe there are other solutions where a ≠ b, but their swap is also a solution. However, in our previous case, a = 1 and b = 1 is the only solution. So perhaps there's only one ordered pair.

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
So, the equation simplifies to:

8a² + 2b² + 4a + 2b + 8ab + 8a²b + 4ab² = 32ab

<prompt_2.1> Set the expanded left-hand side equal to the right-hand side and rearrange the equation to one side. </prompt_2.1>
-----

Based on execution_1.2:
First term: (1 + 2a)/a = 1/a + 2

Second term: (2 + 2b)/b = 2/b + 2

Third term: (2a + b)

So the equation becomes:

(1/a + 2)(2/b + 2)(2a + b) = 32

Let me denote variables to simplify. Let x = 1/a and y = 1/b. Then, since a and b are positive, x and y are positive as well.

<prompt_2.2> Use substitutions x = 1/a and y = 1/b to simplify the equation and analyze the resulting expression. </prompt_2.2>
-----

Based on execution_1.3:
Let me check if there's another solution where a ≠ b. Suppose a = 2, then maybe b can be something else. Let's try plugging in a = 2 and see if we can solve for b.

<prompt_2.3> Test specific values for a (e.g., a=2, a=0.5) to check for other solutions and verify the uniqueness of the solution. </prompt_2.3>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Bring all terms to one side:

8a² + 2b² + 4a + 2b + 8ab + 8a²b + 4ab² - 32ab = 0

Combine like terms:

8a² + 2b² + 4a + 2b + (8ab - 32ab) + 8a²b + 4ab² = 0

Simplify:

8a² + 2b² + 4a + 2b - 24ab + 8a²b + 4ab² = 0
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Then, the equation becomes:

(x + 2)(2y + 2)(2*(1/x) + (1/y)) = 32

Wait, hold on. Let's check:

First term: (1/a + 2) = x + 2

Second term: (2/b + 2) = 2y + 2

Third term: (2a + b) = 2/x + 1/y

So, the equation is:

(x + 2)(2y + 2)(2/x + 1/y) = 32

Hmm, this might not necessarily make it easier. Let me compute this:

First, compute (x + 2)(2y + 2):

(x + 2)(2y + 2) = 2xy + 2x + 4y + 4

Then multiply by (2/x + 1/y):

[2xy + 2x + 4y + 4] * (2/x + 1/y)

Let's distribute each term:

First term: 2xy * 2/x = 4y

Second term: 2xy * 1/y = 2x

Third term: 2x * 2/x = 4

Fourth term: 2x * 1/y = 2x/y

Fifth term: 4y * 2/x = 8y/x

Sixth term: 4y * 1/y = 4

Seventh term: 4 * 2/x = 8/x

Eighth term: 4 * 1/y = 4/y

So, adding all these up:

4y + 2x + 4 + 2x/y + 8y/x + 4 + 8/x + 4/y

Combine like terms:

- Constants: 4 + 4 = 8
- Terms with x: 2x
- Terms with y: 4y
- Terms with x/y: 2x/y
- Terms with y/x: 8y/x
- Terms with 1/x: 8/x
- Terms with 1/y: 4/y

So, the equation becomes:

8 + 2x + 4y + 2x/y + 8y/x + 8/x + 4/y = 32

Subtract 32 from both sides:

-24 + 2x + 4y + 2x/y + 8y/x + 8/x + 4/y = 0

Hmm, this seems more complicated. Maybe this substitution isn't helpful. Let me think of another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps using substitution variables to reduce the number of variables. Let me set t = a/b or something like that.
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
If a = 2, then the original equation becomes:

(1 + 4)(2 + 2b)(4 + b) = 32*2*b

Compute each term:

(5)(2 + 2b)(4 + b) = 64b

Simplify (2 + 2b) = 2(1 + b), so:

5 * 2(1 + b)(4 + b) = 64b

10(1 + b)(4 + b) = 64b

Divide both sides by 2:

5(1 + b)(4 + b) = 32b

Expand (1 + b)(4 + b) = 4 + 5b + b²

So:

5(4 + 5b + b²) = 32b

20 + 25b + 5b² = 32b

Bring all terms to left:

5b² + 25b + 20 - 32b = 0

Simplify:

5b² - 7b + 20 = 0

Quadratic equation: 5b² -7b +20=0. Discriminant D=49 - 400 = -351 <0. No real solutions. So a=2 is invalid.

How about a=0.5?

Original equation:

(1 + 1)(2 + 2b)(1 + b) = 32*0.5*b

Compute:

2*(2 + 2b)*(1 + b) = 16b

Simplify (2 + 2b) = 2(1 + b), so:

2*2(1 + b)*(1 + b) = 16b

4(1 + b)^2 = 16b

Divide both sides by 4:

(1 + b)^2 = 4b

Expand:

1 + 2b + b² = 4b

Bring all terms to left:

b² - 2b +1 =0

Which factors as (b -1)^2 =0. So b=1. Thus, a=0.5 and b=1 is a solution. Wait, but earlier we had a=1 and b=1. So this is a different solution. So here, when a=0.5, b=1 is a solution. So that's another ordered pair: (0.5, 1). But wait, earlier we thought there was only one solution. Hmm, this suggests that there might be more solutions.

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
This looks quite messy. Maybe there's a smarter way to factor or simplify the original equation before expanding. Let me revisit the original equation:

(1 + 2a)(2 + 2b)(2a + b) = 32ab

<prompt_3.1> Re-express the original equation in terms of fractions and factor where possible to simplify the equation. </prompt_3.1>
-----

Based on execution_2.2:
Another approach: Let's see if we can apply AM-GM inequality here. Since the equation is a product of terms equal to 32ab, which is a product involving a and b. Let's try to manipulate the equation to see if AM-GM can be applied.

<prompt_3.2> Use the AM-GM inequality on the terms of the equation to find a lower bound and check for equality conditions. </prompt_3.2>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
Let me see if I can factor any terms or simplify the expression before expanding. Let's look at each term:

1. (1 + 2a)
2. (2 + 2b) = 2(1 + b)
3. (2a + b)

So, the equation can be written as:

(1 + 2a) * 2(1 + b) * (2a + b) = 32ab

Divide both sides by 2:

(1 + 2a)(1 + b)(2a + b) = 16ab

Hmm, this seems a bit simpler. Maybe this is a better form to work with.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
First, note that all terms in the product (1 + 2a), (2 + 2b), (2a + b) are positive, as a and b are positive. Let's see if we can write each term in a form that allows AM-GM.

For example, take the term (1 + 2a). Since 1 and 2a are positive, by AM-GM:

1 + 2a ≥ 2√(1 * 2a) = 2√(2a)

Similarly, for (2 + 2b):

2 + 2b = 2(1 + b) ≥ 2 * 2√(1 * b) = 4√b

Wait, no. Wait, (1 + b) ≥ 2√b, so 2(1 + b) ≥ 4√b. So (2 + 2b) ≥ 4√b.

Similarly, for (2a + b), let's apply AM-GM:

2a + b ≥ 2√(2a * b) = 2√(2ab)

So now, multiplying these inequalities together:

(1 + 2a)(2 + 2b)(2a + b) ≥ [2√(2a)] * [4√b] * [2√(2ab)]

Multiply the constants:

2 * 4 * 2 = 16

Multiply the radicals:

√(2a) * √b * √(2ab) = √(2a * b * 2ab) = √(4a²b²) = 2ab

So the RHS is 16 * 2ab = 32ab

Therefore, the left-hand side is greater than or equal to 32ab, and the equation is (1 + 2a)(2 + 2b)(2a + b) = 32ab. Therefore, equality holds when each of the AM-GM inequalities used becomes equality. 

For AM-GM, equality holds when the terms are equal. So:

1. For (1 + 2a) ≥ 2√(2a): equality holds when 1 = 2a. So 2a = 1 => a = 1/2.
2. For (2 + 2b) ≥ 4√b: equality holds when 2 = 2b => b = 1.
3. For (2a + b) ≥ 2√(2ab): equality holds when 2a = b.

Wait, but let's check the third inequality. The third term was (2a + b) ≥ 2√(2ab). For equality, 2a = b. But from the first equality, we have a = 1/2, so b = 2a = 1. So if a = 1/2 and b = 1, then 2a = 1 = b. So all three equalities hold when a = 1/2 and b = 1. Therefore, the only solution is a = 1/2 and b = 1. 

Therefore, there is only one ordered pair (a, b) = (1/2, 1).

</Execution_3>

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
Let me write that down:

(1 + 2a)(1 + b)(2a + b) = 16ab

Now, maybe we can use substitution here. Let me set x = a and y = b, but that might not help. Alternatively, perhaps express some variables in terms of others. Let's see.

<prompt_4.1> Use substitution variables and expand the left-hand side to simplify the equation. </prompt_4.1>
-----

Based on execution_3.2:
Wait, but earlier when I tried a = 0.5 and b = 1, that worked. Let me verify if that's the only solution.

Given that equality in AM-GM holds only when all the terms are equal in each inequality, and we saw that for equality in all three steps, we must have a = 1/2 and b = 1. Therefore, that's the only solution. Hence, there is only one ordered pair (a, b) = (1/2, 1).

<prompt_4.2> Confirm the uniqueness of the solution by analyzing the equality conditions of the AM-GM inequalities. </prompt_4.2>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
Let's expand the left-hand side. First, multiply (1 + 2a) and (1 + b):

(1 + 2a)(1 + b) = 1*1 + 1*b + 2a*1 + 2a*b = 1 + b + 2a + 2ab

So, the left-hand side becomes:

(1 + b + 2a + 2ab)(2a + b)

Now, let's multiply this out:

First, multiply 1 by (2a + b): 2a + b

Then, multiply b by (2a + b): 2ab + b²

Then, multiply 2a by (2a + b): 4a² + 2ab

Then, multiply 2ab by (2a + b): 4a²b + 2ab²

So, adding all these terms together:

2a + b + 2ab + b² + 4a² + 2ab + 4a²b + 2ab²

Combine like terms:

- Constant terms: None.
- Terms with a: 2a
- Terms with b: b
- Terms with ab: 2ab + 2ab = 4ab
- Terms with a²: 4a²
- Terms with b²: b²
- Terms with a²b: 4a²b
- Terms with ab²: 2ab²

So, the expanded left-hand side is:

4a² + b² + 2a + b + 4ab + 4a²b + 2ab²
</execution_4.1>

<execution_4.2>
Therefore, the answer should be \boxed{1}.

But wait, let me check again. When we applied AM-GM, we had three inequalities, each equality giving a condition. Then, solving those conditions gives a unique solution. Therefore, there is only one solution.

First term: 1*(2a + b) = 2a + b

Second term: b*(2a + b) = 2ab + b²

Third term: 2a*(2a + b) = 4a² + 2ab

Based on execution_7.1:
Hmm, this still looks complicated. Maybe there's a substitution or factoring trick here. Let me see if I can factor this expression.

Looking at the terms, perhaps grouping terms with similar degrees or variables. Let's try grouping terms with a², b², ab, etc.:

4a² + 4a²b + 2ab² + b² + 2a + b - 12ab = 0

Factor terms where possible:

Factor 4a²(1 + b) + 2ab² + b² + 2a + b - 12ab = 0

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps factor terms with a², ab, etc.:

Group terms with a²: 4a²(1 + b)

Terms with ab: 2ab² -12ab

Terms with a: 2a

Terms with b: b

Terms with b²: b²

So, rewrite:

4a²(1 + b) + 2ab(b - 6) + 2a + b + b² = 0

Still not obvious. Maybe we can factor in terms of a or b. Let's try to treat this as a polynomial in a and see if we can factor it.

Alternatively, let's consider that since we have two variables, perhaps we can fix one variable and solve for the other. Let's try solving for a in terms of b or vice versa.

<prompt_8.1> Treat the equation as a polynomial in one variable and attempt to factor or solve for the other variable. </prompt_8.1>

<Execution_8>
<execution_8.1>
Let's try solving for a. Let's rewrite the equation:

4a² + 4a²b + 2ab² + b² + 2a + b - 12ab = 0

This is a quadratic in a. Let's rearrange terms:

(4 + 4b)a² + (2b² + 2 - 12b)a + (b² + b) = 0

So, in the form:

A a² + B a + C = 0

Where:

A = 4 + 4b

B = 2b² + 2 - 12b

C = b² + b

Now, if we can factor this quadratic, we might be able to find solutions. Let's try to factor it.
</execution_8.1>
</Execution_8>

<Plan_9>
Based on execution_8.1:
Let's check if (2a + b) is a factor. Let me perform polynomial division or factorization.

Suppose 2a + b is a factor. Let's see if when we divide the quadratic by 2a + b, we get a linear term.

<prompt_9.1> Perform polynomial division to check if 2a + b is a factor of the quadratic expression. </prompt_9.1>
</Plan_9>

<Execution_9>
<execution_9.1>
Alternatively, since we know from AM-GM that a = 1/2 and b = 1 is a solution, perhaps this quadratic factors with (2a + b) as one of the roots. Let's check.

If a = 1/2 and b = 1, then 2a + b = 1 + 1 = 2. Let's plug a = 1/2 into the quadratic equation:

A = 4 + 4b = 4 + 4*1 = 8

B = 2*1² + 2 - 12*1 = 2 + 2 - 12 = -8

C = 1² + 1 = 2

So the quadratic becomes 8a² -8a +2 =0. Let's see if a=1/2 is a root:

8*(1/2)^2 -8*(1/2) +2 = 8*(1/4) -4 +2 = 2 -4 +2 =0. Yes, a=1/2 is a root. Therefore, (a -1/2) is a factor. Let's factor the quadratic:

8a² -8a +2 = 0

We can write this as 2(4a² -4a +1) =0. The quadratic inside the parentheses is 4a² -4a +1, which factors as (2a -1)^2. Therefore, the quadratic is 2*(2a -1)^2 =0. Therefore, the equation is satisfied when 2a -1 =0 => a=1/2.

So, the quadratic equation in a factors as 2*(2a -1)^2 =0, which gives a=1/2 as a double root. Therefore, the only solution for a is 1/2. Then, substituting back into the original equation, we can find b.

Wait, but this seems conflicting with our earlier conclusion where we had a=1/2 and b=1. Wait, let's check.

If a=1/2, then the quadratic equation in a gives a=1/2. Then, from the original equation, we can solve for b. Wait, but when we set a=1/2, we can substitute back into the original equation to find b. Let's do that.

Original equation:

(1 + 2*(1/2))(2 + 2b)(2*(1/2) + b) = 32*(1/2)*b

Simplify each term:

(1 +1)(2 + 2b)(1 + b) = 16b

Which is:

2*(2 + 2b)*(1 + b) =16b

Simplify:

2*2*(1 + b)*(1 + b) =16b

4*(1 + b)^2 =16b

Divide both sides by 4:

(1 + b)^2 =4b

Expand left side:

1 + 2b + b² =4b

Bring all terms to left:

b² -2b +1 =0

Which factors as (b -1)^2=0, so b=1. Therefore, the only solution is a=1/2 and b=1. Hence, there is only one ordered pair (a, b) = (1/2, 1).

But earlier, when I tried a=0.5 and b=1, it worked. So that's the only solution. Therefore, the number of ordered pairs is 1.

<Plan_10>
Based on execution_9.1:
But let me check once more to ensure there are no other solutions. Suppose there's another solution where a ≠1/2 or b ≠1. Let's suppose there exists another solution where a ≠1/2 and b ≠1. But according to the quadratic equation, when we set a=1/2, it's the only solution for a. Therefore, there are no other solutions. Hence, the only solution is a=1/2 and b=1.
