<Question>
Let $K$ be the number of sequences $A_1$, $A_2$, $\dots$, $A_n$ such that $n$ is a positive integer less than or equal to $10$, each $A_i$ is a subset of $\{1, 2, 3, \dots, 10\}$, and $A_{i-1}$ is a subset of $A_i$ for each $i$ between $2$ and $n$, inclusive. For example, $\{\}$, $\{5, 7\}$, $\{2, 5, 7\}$, $\{2, 5, 7\}$, $\{2, 5, 6, 7, 9\}$ is one such sequence, with $n = 5$.What is the remainder when $K$ is divided by $10$?

Okay, so I need to find the number of sequences of subsets where each subset is contained within the next one, and the length of the sequence is a positive integer up to 10. Then, I have to find the remainder when that number is divided by 10. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, let me understand the problem properly. We have sequences A₁, A₂, ...., Aₙ where n can be any integer from 1 to 10. Each Aᵢ is a subset of {1, 2, 3, ...., 10}, and for each i from 2 to n, A_{i-1} is a subset of A_i. So, each subsequent set in the sequence must include all the elements of the previous one. The question is asking for the total number of such sequences across all possible n from 1 to 10, and then the remainder when that total is divided by 10.

Let me start by considering what a single such sequence looks like. If n is fixed, say n = k, then the number of sequences of length k where each set is a subset of the next is equal to 2^{10*(k-1)}. Wait, is that right?

<prompt_1.1> Explain the reasoning behind the formula 2^{10*(k-1)} for the number of sequences of subsets where each subset is contained in the next, and verify if this formula is correct. </prompt_1.1>
-----

But wait, let me check if this reasoning is correct. Let's take a small example.

<prompt_1.2> Verify the formula for small values of n (n=1, 2, 3) and confirm if the formula holds. </prompt_1.2>
-----

But let me check for n=1. For n=1, the number of sequences is 2^10 = 1024. So the total K would be 1024 + 2048 + ... + 2^{10*9}.

But perhaps there's a smarter way to compute this sum. Let me think about the sum S = 2^{10*0} + 2^{10*1} + 2^{10*2} + ... + 2^{10*9} }.

<prompt_1.3> Express the total number of sequences K as a geometric series and find a closed-form formula for the sum. </prompt_1.3>
-----

But let me confirm with another approach. Let's think of each element in {1,2,...,10} independently.

<prompt_1.4> Consider each element in the set {1,2,...,10} independently and analyze how it contributes to the total number of sequences. </prompt_1.4>

<execution_1.1>
For each element in the universal set {1, 2, ...., 10}, there are k choices: it can be introduced at any of the k positions (including not being introduced at all). Wait, no, actually, since each subset must be a subset of the next, each element can be added at most once, and once added, it remains. So for each element, the number of ways it can be introduced is the number of ways to choose the first position where it appears. For example, it can appear in none of the subsets, or it can first appear in the first subset, or second, ...., up to the nth subset. So for each element, there are (k + 1) choices: either it's never included, or it's first included in the first subset, second, ...., up to the kth subset. Wait, no, if it's first included in the first subset, then it's in all subsets from A₁ onwards. If it's first included in the second subset, then it's not in A₁ but in A₂, A₃, ...., Aₙ. Similarly, if it's never included, then it's not in any. So for each element, the number of choices is (k + 1). Therefore, for each element, there are (k + 1) options. Since there are 10 elements, the total number of sequences of length k is (k + 1)^10. Wait, but in the problem statement, n is the length of the sequence, which can be from 1 to 10. So for each n from 1 to 10, the number of sequences is (n + 1)^10? Wait, hold on, but when n=1, the number of sequences should be 2^10, since each subset is a subset of itself. But according to the formula (n + 1)^10, when n=1, it would be 2^10, which matches. When n=2, the formula gives 3^10. But earlier, I thought it was 2^{10*(k-1)}. Hmm, conflicting results here. Which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I need to clarify. Let's take n=2. How many sequences are there? The first set A₁ can be any subset, and the second set A₂ must contain A₁. So for each element, once it's in A₁, it must be in A₂. So for each element, the choices are: either it's in neither A₁ nor A₂, or it's in both A₁ and A₂, or it's in A₂ but not in A₁. Wait, but if it's in A₁, it must be in A₂. So for each element, the possibilities are: not in A₁ and not in A₂, or not in A₁ but in A₂, or in both A₁ and A₂. So that's 3 choices per element. Therefore, for n=2, the number of sequences is 3^10. Similarly, for n=3, each element can be in none, in A₁ and the rest, or in A₂ and the rest, or in A₃ and the rest. Wait, no. Wait, if the sequence is A₁, A₂, A₃, each subsequent set must include the previous. So for each element, once it's added in A_i, it must be in all A_j for j ≥ i. Therefore, for each element, the number of choices is the number of possible positions it can first appear, including never appearing. So for n subsets, each element can first appear in A₁, A₂, ...., A_n, or never. So that's n + 1 choices per element. Therefore, for n subsets, the number of sequences is (n + 1)^10. Therefore, for n=1, it's 2^10, which is correct. For n=2, 3^10. For n=3, 4^10, etc. So the total K is the sum from n=1 to 10 of (n + 1)^10.
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
Suppose n = 1. Then there's only one set, which can be any subset of {1, 2, ...., 10}. So that's 2^10 = 1024 sequences.

If n = 2, then we need two subsets A₁ ⊆ A₂. The number of such sequences is the number of pairs (A₁, A₂) where A₁ ⊆ A₂. For each element, it can be in neither A₁ nor A₂, just in A₂, or in both. So for each element, there are 3 choices. Hence, 3^10 sequences. Wait, but 3^10 is 59049. But according to the previous formula, 2^{10*(2-1)} = 2^10 = 1024, which is different. So my initial assumption was wrong.
</execution_1.2>

<execution_1.3>
That's a geometric series with ratio 2^{10} and 10 terms. The formula for the sum of a geometric series is S = a₁*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1), where a₁ is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms. Here, a₁ = 1, r = 2^{10}, and n = 10. So, S = (2^{10*10} - 1)/(2^{10} - 1) = (2^{100} - 1)/(2^{10} - 1).

Therefore, K = (2^{100} - 1)/(2^{10} - 1).
</execution_1.3>

<execution_1.4>
For each element, we can think about how it behaves across the subsets in the sequence. Since each subset must be contained within the next, once an element is included in a subset, it must be included in all subsequent subsets. So, for each element, the choice is when to first include it in the sequence. It can be first included at any position from 1 to n, or not included at all.

Wait, but n varies here. Wait, no. Because n is the length of the sequence, which also varies. So for each element, the number of ways it can be included in the sequence is the number of possible positions where it first appears. But since n can vary from 1 to 10, we need to consider all possible sequences lengths and for each length, the number of ways the element is included.

But maybe there's a better way to model this. Let's think of the entire sequence. For each element, the positions where it appears must form an interval from some start position to the end of the sequence. So, for each element, the possible choices are: either it is never included (1 way), or it is included starting at position 1, 2, ...., up to position n. But since n can vary, this complicates things.

Alternatively, consider that for each element, the number of sequences where it is included starting at position k is equal to the number of sequences of length >= k. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Alternatively, if we fix an element, say element x, then for each sequence of subsets, the element x can be introduced at some position i (from 1 to n), or not introduced at all. However, since the sequence is of length n, if x is introduced at position i, then it must be present in all subsets from A_i to A_n. If x is never introduced, then it's not in any subset.

But since n can vary, we have to account for all possible n from 1 to 10. So, for each element x, the number of choices is the number of possible positions it can be introduced (including not being introduced). But since n is variable, the maximum position for introduction is 10 (since n can be up to 10). Wait, but for each element x, the number of choices is the number of possible n (from 1 to 10) and for each n, the number of positions to introduce x (from 1 to n) plus the option of not introducing x at all.

But this seems complicated. Maybe another approach.

Wait, perhaps the total number of sequences is the product over each element of (number of ways the element can be introduced in the sequence). Since each element is independent, the total number of sequences would be the product of the number of ways each element can be handled.

For each element, how many ways can it be introduced in a sequence of subsets where each subset is contained in the next? The element can either not be in any subset, or first appear in A_i for some i from 1 to n, and then stay in all subsequent subsets. But n can vary. Wait, but n is the length of the sequence, so for each element, the number of ways to decide when it first appears is the number of possible n (from 1 to 10) times the number of positions within that n where it first appears.

But this seems tricky. Let me think differently.

Suppose for each element, we decide the last position in the sequence where it is included. Wait, no, because once it's included, it must stay. So actually, for each element, the number of ways is the number of possible positions where it first appears (from 1 to 10) plus the option of never appearing.

Wait, but if the sequence can be of length up to 10, then for each element, the number of choices is 11 (position 1 to 10, or never). But wait, if the sequence is of length n, then for each element, the number of choices is n + 1 (n positions to first appear, or never). But since n can vary, this complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps for each element, the number of choices is the number of possible "intervals" it can cover in the sequence. Since the sequence can be of any length up to 10, and the element can be in any suffix of the sequence (including the entire sequence or none). So for each element, the number of ways is the number of possible suffixes. For a sequence of length n, the number of suffixes is n (from position 1 to n). But since n can be up to 10, the total number of suffixes across all possible n is the sum from n=1 to 10 of n = 55. Plus 1 for never being included. So total 56.

But wait, that seems too high. Wait, no. Because for each element, the number of ways it can be introduced is the number of possible positions it can first appear (from 1 to 10) or never. So for each element, there are 10 (positions 1 to 10) + 1 (never) = 11 choices. Therefore, since there are 10 elements, the total number of sequences would be 11^10. But wait, that can't be right because the total number of sequences is 11^10, but the original problem counts sequences of varying lengths up to 10. Wait, but 11^10 is actually the number of sequences where each element can be introduced at any position or never, but the sequence can be of any length. Wait, maybe that's exactly the case.

Wait, let's think again. For each element, the number of ways it can be handled is 11: either never included, or included starting at position 1, 2, ...., 10. But if the sequence can be of any length up to 10, then for each element, the number of choices is 11 (including never). Therefore, since there are 10 elements, the total number of sequences is 11^10. But wait, the problem states that n is a positive integer less than or equal to 10. So n can be 1, 2, ...., 10. So the total number of sequences is the sum over n=1 to 10 of 2^{10*(n-1)}. But according to this other approach, it's 11^10. Which one is correct?

Wait, let's calculate both. For n=1, the number of sequences is 2^10 = 1024. For n=2, it's 2^{10*1} = 2048. For n=3, 2^{10*2} = 4096. So the total sum S is 2^0 + 2^10 + 2^20 + ... + 2^{90}.

But according to the other approach, it's 11^10. Let's compute 11^10.

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.2:
Wait, but 11^10 is 25937424601, which is way larger than 2^100. So that can't be. There must be a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps the two approaches are conflicting because they model the problem differently. Let me check again.

<prompt_2.1> Compare the two approaches and clarify which one correctly models the problem. </prompt_2.1>
-----

Let me verify with n=2. If n=2, according to the first approach, the number of sequences is 3^10. According to the second approach, it's 11^10. But 3^10 is 59049, which is much smaller than 11^10. So clearly, the first approach is correct because 3^10 is the number for n=2.

<prompt_2.2> Verify the correctness of the first approach by comparing the results for small values of n and conclude which approach is correct. </prompt_2.2>

Based on execution_1.4:
Let me compute 2^100 modulo 10. Since 2^10 = 1024, which is 4 mod 10. Then 2^10 ≡ 4 mod 10.

<prompt_2.3> Calculate the sum S modulo 10 using the formula S = (2^{100} - 1)/(2^{10} - 1) and find the remainder when K is divided by 10. </prompt_2.3>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Wait, in the first approach, for each element, the number of choices is n + 1, so for n=10, it's 11^10. But in the problem statement, n can be from 1 to 10. So if we fix n=10, the number of sequences is 11^10. But the problem is summing over all n from 1 to 10. So the total K is sum_{n=1}^{10} 11^n. Because for each n, the number of sequences is 11^n. Wait, but that contradicts the earlier analysis where for each n, it's (n + 1)^10. Wait, no. Wait, if for each element, the number of choices is n + 1, then for each n, the number of sequences is (n + 1)^10. Therefore, K = sum_{n=1}^{10} (n + 1)^10 = sum_{k=2}^{11} k^10. But that can't be, because when n=1, (n + 1)^10 = 2^10, which matches. When n=2, 3^10, etc. So K is the sum from k=2 to k=11 of k^10. But this contradicts the earlier conclusion that K is 11^10. So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps the confusion is between fixing n and considering all sequences for all n. Let me think. For each n, the number of sequences of length n is (n + 1)^10. Therefore, the total K is sum_{n=1}^{10} (n + 1)^10. So that's 2^10 + 3^10 + 4^10 + ... + 11^10. But according to the other approach, where each element can be in any suffix (including none), the total number of sequences is 11^10. But that would be if we had fixed n=10. But in this problem, n can vary from 1 to 10. So the total number of sequences is the sum over n=1 to 10 of (n + 1)^10. So that's 2^10 + 3^10 + ... + 11^10.

But this seems conflicting with the other approach. Wait, maybe the other approach is wrong because it's not considering that the sequence can be of varying lengths. Let's clarify. If we consider each sequence as having a certain length n (from 1 to 10), then for each such n, the number of sequences is (n + 1)^10. Therefore, the total K is sum_{n=1}^{10} (n + 1)^10. Therefore, K = 2^10 + 3^10 + 4^10 + ... + 11^10.

But then, how does this relate to the other approach where each element can be in any suffix or not? If n is fixed, then for each element, the number of choices is n + 1, hence (n + 1)^10. But if n is variable, then the total number of sequences is the sum over n=1 to 10 of (n + 1)^10. So that's correct. Therefore, K is the sum from n=1 to 10 of (n + 1)^10.

Therefore, K = sum_{k=2}^{11} k^10. So that's the same as sum_{k=2}^{11} k^10. Therefore, K = 2^10 + 3^10 + ... + 11^10.

But the problem is asking for the remainder when K is divided by 10. So we need to compute sum_{k=2}^{11} k^10 mod 10.

But how do we compute k^10 mod 10 for k from 2 to 11, then sum them up mod 10.

First, note that k and k mod 10 are congruent modulo 10. So k^10 mod 10 is equivalent to (k mod 10)^10 mod 10. So we can compute (k mod 10)^10 mod 10 for k from 2 to 11. Since 11 mod 10 is 1, so k from 2 to 11 corresponds to k mod 10 from 2 to 1 (since 11 mod 10 = 1). Therefore, the exponents for each k mod 10 would be:

For k ≡ 0 mod 10: 10^10 mod 10 = 0^10 mod 10 = 0

For k ≡ 1 mod 10: 1^10 mod 10 = 1

For k ≡ 2 mod 10: 2^10 mod 10 = (2^4)^2 * 2^2 mod 10. 2^4=16≡6, so 6^2=36≡6, 6*4=24≡4 mod 10. Wait, 2^10=1024≡4 mod 10.

Similarly:
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
But according to the second approach, each element can be introduced at positions 1 or 2, or never. For each element, that's 3 choices. So 3^10 for n=2. So that's correct. So the general formula for the number of sequences of length n is (n + 1)^10. Therefore, the total K is the sum from n=1 to 10 of (n + 1)^10. So K = 2^10 + 3^10 + 4^10 + ... + 11^10.
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
Then 2^20 ≡ (2^10)^2 ≡ 4^2 = 16 ≡ 6 mod 10. 2^30 ≡ 4*6 = 24 ≡ 4 mod 10. 2^40 ≡ 6 mod 10. 2^50 ≡ 4 mod 10. 2^60 ≡ 6 mod 10. 2^70 ≡ 4 mod 10. 2^80 ≡ 6 mod 10. 2^90 ≡ 4 mod 10. Then 2^100 ≡ 6 mod 10. Therefore, 2^100 - 1 ≡ 5 mod 10. Then, 2^{10} - 1 = 1024 - 1 = 1023, which is 3 mod 10. So we have 5 divided by 3 mod 10. To divide 5 by 3 mod 10, we need the modular inverse of 3 mod 10, which is 7, since 3*7=21≡1 mod10. Therefore, 5/3 mod10 ≡5*7=35≡5 mod10. Therefore, the remainder is 5.
</execution_2.3>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.2:
But then the problem says that n can be any positive integer up to 10, so n=1 to 10. Therefore, K is the sum from n=1 to 10 of (n + 1)^10 = sum_{k=2}^{11} k^10.

But calculating this sum modulo 10. Let's compute each term k^10 mod 10 for k from 2 to 11.

<execution_3.1>
First, note that 11 mod 10 is 1, so 11^10 mod 10 is the same as 1^10 mod 10 = 1.

Then, for k from 2 to 10, we can compute k^10 mod 10.

But we can use the fact that for any integer k, k^φ(10) ≡ 1 mod 10 if k and 10 are coprime. φ(10) = 4. So Euler's theorem tells us that k^4 ≡ 1 mod 10 when k is coprime to 10. Therefore, k^10 = k^(4*2 + 2) = (k^4)^2 * k^2 ≡ 1^2 * k^2 ≡ k^2 mod 10. Therefore, for k coprime to 10, k^10 ≡ k^2 mod 10.

But for k not coprime to 10, we have to compute directly.

Let's list k from 2 to 11:

k=2: 2^10 mod 10. Since 2 and 10 are not coprime. 2^10 = 1024, 1024 mod 10 = 4.

k=3: 3 and 10 are coprime. So 3^10 ≡ 3^2 = 9 mod 10.

k=4: 4 and 10 are not coprime. 4^10. Let's compute 4^1=4, 4^2=16≡6, 4^3=24≡4, 4^4=16≡6, so it cycles every 2. 10 is even, so 4^10 ≡ 6 mod 10.

k=5: 5 and 10 are not coprime. 5^10 ≡ 5 mod 10.

k=6: 6 and 10 are not coprime. 6^10. Any power of 6 ends with 6, so 6 mod 10.

k=7: 7 and 10 are coprime. 7^10 ≡ 7^2 = 49 ≡ 9 mod 10.

k=8: 8 and 10 are not coprime. 8^10. Let's compute 8^2=64≡4, 8^4=4^2=16≡6, 8^8=6^2=36≡6, 8^10=8^8 * 8^2 ≡ 6 * 4 = 24≡4 mod 10.

k=9: 9 and 10 are coprime. 9^10 ≡ 9^2 = 81 ≡ 1 mod 10.

k=10: 10 and 10 are not coprime. 10^10 ≡ 0 mod 10.

k=11: 11 mod 10 = 1, so 1^10 ≡ 1 mod 10.

Now, let's list all these:

k=2: 4

k=3: 9

k=4: 6

k=5: 5

k=6: 6

k=7: 9

k=8: 4

k=9: 1

k=10: 0

k=11: 1

Now, sum these up:

Let's add them step by step:

Start with 0.

Add 4 (k=2): total 4

Add 9 (k=3): total 13

Add 6 (k=4): total 19

Add 5 (k=5): total 24

Add 6 (k=6): total 30

Add 9 (k=7): total 39

Add 4 (k=8): total 43

Add 1 (k=9): total 44

Add 0 (k=10): total 44

Add 1 (k=11): total 45

So the total sum of k^10 mod 10 for k from 2 to 11 is 45.

Therefore, K ≡ 45 mod 10 ≡ 5 mod 10.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. Let me recount the sum:
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
We have S = (2^100 - 1) / (2^10 - 1). We need S mod 10. But 2^10 ≡ 4 mod 10, so 2^10 - 1 ≡ 3 mod 10. Then 2^100 ≡ (2^10)^10 ≡ 4^10 mod 10. 4^1 = 4, 4^2 = 16 ≡ 6, 4^3 = 24 ≡ 4, 4^4 = 16 ≡ 6, etc. So 4^10 ≡ 6 mod 10. Therefore, 2^100 - 1 ≡ 6 - 1 = 5 mod 10. Then S ≡ 5 / 3 mod 10. Since 3*7=21≡1 mod 10, the inverse of 3 is 7. So 5*7=35≡5 mod 10. Therefore, S ≡ 5 mod 10.

Therefore, the remainder when K is divided by 10 is 5.

But let me check once more with the sum of k^10 mod 10. The sum was 4 + 9 + 6 + 5 + 6 + 9 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 45, which is 5 mod 10. So the answer should be 5.

But wait, let me check if there's a mistake in the initial assumption. The problem states that each A_i is a subset of {1, 2, 3, ...., 10}, and the sequence length n is a positive integer less than or equal to 10. So n can be from 1 to 10. For each n, the number of sequences is (n + 1)^10, so sum_{n=1}^{10} (n + 1)^10 = sum_{k=2}^{11} k^10. Then, sum_{k=2}^{11} k^10 mod 10. As we computed, that's 45 mod 10 = 5. Therefore, the remainder is 5.

Yes, that seems correct. So the final answer is 5.
