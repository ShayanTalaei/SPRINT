Okay, let's see. The problem is about Jackson's paintbrush and figuring out how many square centimeters of paper he can cover with the paint he has. Hmm. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the paintbrush makes a narrow strip that's 6.5 millimeters wide. So, that's the width of the strip. Then, Jackson has enough paint to make a strip 25 meters long. So, the length of the strip is 25 meters. The question is asking for the area covered in square centimeters. Alright, so we need to calculate the area of this strip and convert it to square centimeters.

Wait, area is length multiplied by width, right? So, if we have the length and the width, we can multiply them to get the area. But the units here are different: the width is in millimeters and the length is in meters. So, I need to convert them to the same unit before multiplying. Then, convert the result to square centimeters.

Let me plan this out.

First, convert the width from millimeters to meters because the length is already in meters. Alternatively, convert the length from meters to centimeters and the width from millimeters to centimeters.

<prompt_1.1> Convert the width from millimeters to meters and the length from meters to centimeters, then multiply to find the area in square meters. </prompt_1.1>

But the question asks for square centimeters. So, I need to convert 1625 square meters to square centimeters. Since 1 meter is 100 centimeters, 1 square meter is (100 cm)^2 = 10,000 square centimeters. Therefore, 1625 square meters is 1625 * 10,000 square centimeters. Let me calculate that.

<prompt_1.2> Convert 1625 square meters to square centimeters by multiplying by 10,000. </prompt_1.2>

<execution_1.1>
Let me think. Let's see. There are 1000 millimeters in a meter, right? So, 6.5 millimeters is 6.5 / 1000 meters. Let me compute that. 6.5 divided by 1000 is 0.0065 meters. So, the width is 0.0065 meters, and the length is 25 meters. Then, the area in square meters would be 25 * 0.0065.

Let me do that multiplication. 25 times 0.0065. Hmm. 25 * 0.006 is 0.15, and 25 * 0.0005 is 0.0125. Adding those together: 0.15 + 0.0125 = 0.1625 square meters.
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
1625 * 10,000 is 16,250,000. So, 16,250,000 square centimeters. That seems like a lot, but let's check.

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Wait, but let me verify that.

<prompt_2.1> Verify the area calculation by converting the width to centimeters, the length to centimeters, and then multiplying. </prompt_2.1>

But let me check again. If 1 meter is 100 cm, then 25 meters is 2500 cm.
Width is 6.5 mm, which is 0.65 cm. Then, area is 2500 cm * 0.65 cm = 1625 cm².
That's the same result. So, that seems correct.

But wait, the original problem says "Jackson's paintbrush makes a narrow strip with a width of 6.5 millimeters. Jackson has enough paint to make a strip 25 meters long".

<prompt_2.2> Summarize the problem and confirm the calculations for converting units and calculating the area. </prompt_2.2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Let me recalculate the area. If the width is 0.0065 meters and the length is 25 meters, then 25 * 0.0065. Let's compute 25 * 0.0065. 25 * 0.006 is 0.15, and 25 * 0.0005 is 0.0125. Adding those gives 0.1625 square meters.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
So, the area covered would be the area of the strip. The strip is a rectangle, right? So, length times width. So, the dimensions are 25 meters by 6.5 millimeters. To get the area in square centimeters, we need both dimensions in centimeters.

Alternatively, convert both to meters and then to centimeters. Let's do both ways to check.

First method: Convert width to meters. 6.5 mm is 0.0065 meters. Length is 25 meters. Area in square meters: 25 * 0.0065 = 0.1625 m². Then, convert to square centimeters. Since 1 m² = 10,000 cm², so 0.1625 * 10,000 = 1,625 cm².

Second method: Convert both to centimeters. 25 meters is 2500 cm. 6.5 mm is 0.65 cm. Area: 2500 cm * 0.65 cm = 1,625 cm².

Same result. So, the answer is 1,625 cm².

Based on execution_2.1, execution_2.2:
Therefore, Jackson could cover 1,625 square centimeters of paper with the paint he has.

But wait, let me just make sure there are no unit conversion mistakes. Sometimes when converting, it's easy to mix up the number of zeros or decimal places.

Let me check the first method again. 6.5 mm is 0.0065 meters. 25 meters is 25. Multiply them: 25 * 0.0065. Let's do it another way. 0.0065 * 25. 0.0065 * 10 is 0.065, so 0.0065 * 20 is 0.13, and 0.0065 * 5 is 0.0325. Adding 0.13 + 0.0325 gives 0.1625. Correct. Then, converting to cm²: 0.1625 m² * 10,000 cm²/m² = 1,625 cm². Yep.

Alternatively, if I had converted the width to centimeters first: 6.5 mm is 0.65 cm. Then, the length is 25 meters, which is 2500 cm. So, 2500 cm * 0.65 cm = 1,625 cm². Same answer. So, both methods confirm the same result.

<Final_answer>
Thus, the final answer is \boxed{1625} square centimeters.
