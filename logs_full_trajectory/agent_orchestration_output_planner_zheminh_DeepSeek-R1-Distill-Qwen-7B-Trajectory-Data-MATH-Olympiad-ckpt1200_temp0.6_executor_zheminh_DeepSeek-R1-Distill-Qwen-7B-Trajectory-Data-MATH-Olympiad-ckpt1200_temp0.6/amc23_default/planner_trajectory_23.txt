<Question>
Maureen is keeping track of the mean of her quiz scores this semester. If Maureen scores an $11$ on the next quiz, her mean will increase by $1$. If she scores an $11$ on each of the next three quizzes, her mean will increase by $2$. What is the mean of her quiz scores currently?

Okay, let's see. The problem is about Maureen tracking the mean of her quiz scores. There are two scenarios: one where if she scores 11 on the next quiz, her mean increases by 1. Another where if she scores 11 on each of the next three quizzes, her mean increases by 2. We need to find the current mean of her quiz scores.

Hmm, so let's break this down step by step. Let me start by defining some variables to represent the unknowns here.

<prompt_1.1> Define variables to represent the unknowns in the problem and explain their significance. </prompt_1.1>
-----

Let's check if this makes sense with the second condition.

If she takes three more quizzes, all scored 11, and her mean increases by 2. Let's compute the new mean.

<prompt_1.2> Verify the solution by checking if the second condition (scoring 11 on three quizzes) results in a mean increase of 2. </prompt_1.2>

Is there another way to approach this problem?

Maybe using algebra without assuming the number of quizzes. Let's try that.

Let’s suppose the current number of quizzes is n, and the current mean is m. So total points are n*m.

<prompt_1.3> Use an alternative algebraic approach to verify the solution without assuming a specific number of quizzes. </prompt_1.3>

Another way: think in terms of total points.

Let's say the current total is T, and the current number of quizzes is k. Then the mean is T/k.

First scenario: next quiz score is 11. New total is T + 11, new number of quizzes is k + 1. The new mean is (T + 11)/(k + 1) = (T/k) + 1.

<prompt_1.4> Use an alternative algebraic approach to verify the solution without assuming a specific number of quizzes. </prompt_1.4>

Therefore, the answer is 8. So, after going through multiple approaches and verifying each step, I can confidently say the mean of her current quiz scores is 8.

<execution_1.1>
Let's say currently she has taken 'n' quizzes, and the current mean of those quizzes is 'm'. So, the total points she has right now would be n * m. That makes sense because mean is total divided by the number of items.

Now, the first condition is that if she scores an 11 on the next quiz, her mean increases by 1. So, after taking one more quiz, the total number of quizzes becomes n + 1, and the new mean is m + 1. The total points would then be (n + 1) * (m + 1). But this total is also equal to her current total plus 11, which is n * m + 11. So, we can set up an equation here:

n * m + 11 = (n + 1) * (m + 1)
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
The original mean is 8, so the original total is 8k. Adding three more quizzes with 11 each, the new total is 8k + 11*3 = 8k + 33. The new number of quizzes is k + 3. The new mean is (8k + 33)/(k + 3). According to the problem, this new mean should be 10 (since original mean 8 increased by 2). So:

(8k + 33)/(k + 3) = 10

Multiply both sides by (k + 3):

8k + 33 = 10(k + 3)

8k + 33 = 10k + 30

Subtract 8k from both sides:

33 = 2k + 30

Subtract 30:

3 = 2k

k = 1.5

Wait, that's not possible. The number of quizzes should be an integer. Hmm, that's a problem. Did I do something wrong here?
</execution_1.2>

<execution_1.3>
If she takes three more quizzes, all 11, total quizzes become n + 3. The new mean is (T + 3*11)/(n + 3). According to the problem, this new mean is m + 2.

So, we have two equations:

1) (T + 11)/(n + 1) = m + 1

2) (T + 33)/(n + 3) = m + 2

And we also know that T = m*n.

So substituting T = m*n into both equations:

First equation: (m*n + 11)/(n + 1) = m + 1

Second equation: (m*n + 33)/(n + 3) = m + 2

So now we have two equations with two variables, m and n. Let's solve them.
</execution_1.3>

<execution_1.4>
This gives us the equation:

(T + 11)/(k + 1) = (T/k) + 1

Multiply both sides by k(k + 1):

k(T + 11) = (k + 1)(T) + k(k + 1)

Expand both sides:

kT + 11k = kT + T + k² + k

Subtract kT from both sides:

11k = T + k² + k

So T = 11k - k² - k = 10k - k²

Now, the second condition: three more quizzes of 11 each. New total is T + 33, number of quizzes is k + 3. New mean is (T + 33)/(k + 3) = (T/k) + 2

So:

(T + 33)/(k + 3) = (T/k) + 2

Multiply both sides by k(k + 3):

k(T + 33) = (k + 3)(T) + 2k(k + 3)

Expand:

kT + 33k = kT + 3T + 2k² + 6k

Subtract kT from both sides:

33k = 3T + 2k² + 6k

Bring all terms to left:

33k - 6k - 2k² - 3T = 0

27k - 2k² - 3T = 0

But from the first condition, we have T = 10k - k². Substitute that into this equation:

27k - 2k² - 3(10k - k²) = 0

Expand:

27k - 2k² - 30k + 3k² = 0

Combine like terms:

(27k - 30k) + (-2k² + 3k²) = 0

-3k + k² = 0

Factor:

k(-3 + k) = 0

Solutions: k = 0 or k = 3

But k can't be 0 because she has taken some quizzes. So k = 3.

Then T = 10k - k² = 10*3 - 9 = 30 - 9 = 21

Therefore, current mean is T/k = 21/3 = 7. Wait, this contradicts the previous answer.

Based on execution_1.1:
Let me expand the right-hand side: (n + 1)(m + 1) = n*m + n + m + 1. So the equation becomes:

n*m + 11 = n*m + n + m + 1

<prompt_2.1> Solve the first equation derived from the problem statement to find the relationship between n and m. </prompt_2.1>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Subtract n*m from both sides:

11 = n + m + 1

So, simplifying:

n + m = 10

Okay, so that's the first equation: n + m = 10.
</execution_2.1>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Now, moving on to the second condition.

<prompt_3.1> Solve the second equation derived from the problem statement to find the relationship between n and m. </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
If she scores 11 on each of the next three quizzes, her mean increases by 2. So, after three more quizzes, total quizzes become n + 3, and the new mean is m + 2. The total points would be (n + 3)(m + 2). But this total is also equal to her current total plus 3*11, which is n*m + 33. So:

n*m + 33 = (n + 3)(m + 2)

Expanding the right-hand side: (n + 3)(m + 2) = n*m + 2n + 3m + 6. So:

n*m + 33 = n*m + 2n + 3m + 6

Subtract n*m from both sides:

33 = 2n + 3m + 6

Simplify:

2n + 3m = 27
</execution_3.1>
</Execution_3>

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
So now we have two equations:

1) n + m = 10

2) 2n + 3m = 27

We can solve this system of equations. Let's use substitution. From the first equation, n = 10 - m.

<prompt_4.1> Solve the system of equations derived from the problem conditions to find the values of n and m. </prompt_4.1>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
Substitute into the second equation:

2(10 - m) + 3m = 27

20 - 2m + 3m = 27

20 + m = 27

m = 27 - 20

m = 7

So, the mean of her current quiz scores is 7.
</execution_4.1>
</Execution_4>

<Plan_5>
Based on execution_4.1:
Wait, but let me check if this makes sense with the first condition.

If the current mean is 7, then the current number of quizzes is n = 10 - m = 10 - 7 = 3.

<prompt_5.1> Verify the solution by checking if the first condition (scoring 11 on one quiz) results in a mean increase of 1. </prompt_5.1>

But wait, let me verify again with the second condition to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

<prompt_5.2> Verify the solution by checking if the second condition (scoring 11 on three quizzes) results in a mean increase of 2. </prompt_5.2>

So, the mean of her quiz scores currently is 7.

But wait, let me go through the steps again to ensure there's no mistake.

First equation: n + m = 10

Second equation: 2n + 3m = 27

Solving:

From first equation, n = 10 - m

Substitute into second equation:

2*(10 - m) + 3m = 27

20 - 2m + 3m = 27

20 + m = 27

m = 7

Yes, that's correct. Then n = 10 - 7 = 3.

So, current total is 3*7 = 21. If she scores 11, total becomes 32, number of quizzes 4, mean 8. Which is 1 more. Correct.

If she scores 11 three times, total becomes 21 + 33 = 54, number of quizzes 6, mean 9. Which is 2 more. Correct.

Therefore, the answer is 7.

But wait, the problem says "the mean of her quiz scores currently". So, current mean is 7. But let me check the problem statement again to make sure I didn't misinterpret anything.

The problem states: "If Maureen scores an 11 on the next quiz, her mean will increase by 1. If she scores an 11 on each of the next three quizzes, her mean will increase by 2. What is the mean of her quiz scores currently?"

Yes, that's exactly what we solved. So, the current mean is 7. Therefore, the answer is 7.
</Plan_5>

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
Adding 1 score be be 3boxed. If she scores 11 on the next quiz, total becomes 3*7 + 11 = 21 + 11 = 32. Number of quizzes becomes 4. The new mean is 32/4 = 8, which is indeed 1 more than 7. That checks out.

For the second condition, adding three 11s. Current total is 21. Adding 33 gives 54. Number of quizzes is 6. Mean is 54/6 = 9. Original mean was 7, so 9 - 7 = 2. That also checks out.
</execution_5.1>

<execution_5.2>
If the current is score 7 current her 11, so total becomes 21 + 11 = 32, number of quizzes 4. The new mean is 32/4 = 8, which is 1 more than the original mean of 7. That checks out.

If she takes three more quizzes, each 11, so total becomes 21 + 33 = 54, number of quizzes 6. The new mean is 54/6 = 9, which is 2 more than the original mean of 7. That also checks out.
</execution_5.2>
</Execution_5>

<Final_answer>
Thus, the final answer is \boxed{7}.
