Okay, so I need to find the maximum area of an isosceles trapezoid with legs of length 1, and one base is twice as long as the other. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m² + n². Hmm, let me start by recalling what an isosceles trapezoid is. It's a quadrilateral with a pair of parallel sides (the bases) and the non-parallel sides (the legs) being equal in length.

<prompt_1.1> Recall the definition of an isosceles trapezoid and note the given conditions: legs of length 1 and one base twice as long as the other. Define variables for the lengths of the bases and express the height in terms of these variables. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
In this case, the legs are given as length 1. One base is twice as long as the other. Let me denote the lengths of the bases. Let’s say the shorter base is of length x, then the longer base would be 2x. That makes sense. So the two bases are x and 2x, and the legs are both length 1.

Now, the area of a trapezoid is given by the formula: (1/2) * (sum of the bases) * height. So, Area = (1/2)(x + 2x) * h = (3x/2) * h. So if I can express h in terms of x, then I can write the area as a function of x and then maximize it.

But how do I find the height h in terms of x? Since it's an isosceles trapezoid, the legs are equal, and when you drop perpendiculars from the ends of the shorter base to the longer base, you form two right triangles on either side. The height h is the leg of those right triangles, and the base of each right triangle is (2x - x)/2 = x/2. Wait, let me check that.

If the longer base is 2x and the shorter base is x, then the difference in length is 2x - x = x. Since the trapezoid is isosceles, this difference is split equally between the two sides. So each of those right triangles at the sides has a base of x/2 and hypotenuse of length 1 (the leg of the trapezoid). Then, using the Pythagorean theorem, h² + (x/2)² = 1². So h² = 1 - (x²/4). Therefore, h = sqrt(1 - x²/4).

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
So the area is (3x/2) * sqrt(1 - x²/4). Now, I need to maximize this area with respect to x. But what is the domain of x? Since the height must be real, the expression under the square root must be non-negative.

<prompt_2.1> Determine the domain of x such that the height h is real and positive, and identify the maximum possible value of x. </prompt_2.1>
-----

But let me verify this result step by step to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

First, defining the bases as x and 2x, with legs of length 1. Then, the difference in the bases is x, so each side extension is x/2. Then, the height is sqrt(1 - (x/2)^2). Then, area is (3x/2)*sqrt(1 - x²/4). Then, taking derivative, setting to zero, solving for x, getting x = sqrt(2)/2. Then, substituting back into h, getting sqrt(1 - (2)/16) = sqrt(14/16) = sqrt(14)/4.

<prompt_2.2> Verify the steps by re-deriving the height, area, derivative, critical point, and maximum area. </prompt_2.2>

But let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using trigonometry. Since the trapezoid is isosceles, the legs make equal angles with the longer base. Let me denote the angle between the leg and the longer base as θ.

<prompt_2.3> Use trigonometry to express the height and bases in terms of an angle θ, then express the area as a function of θ and find its maximum. </prompt_2.3>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
So 1 - x²/4 ≥ 0 => x² ≤ 4 => x ≤ 2. Since x is a length, it must be positive, so x ∈ (0, 2]. Therefore, x can range from just above 0 up to 2.

So now, the area is a function of x: A(x) = (3x/2) * sqrt(1 - x²/4). To find its maximum, we can take the derivative of A with respect to x, set it equal to zero, and solve for x. Then check if that critical point is a maximum.

Let me compute the derivative A'(x). Let’s denote f(x) = (3x/2) and g(x) = sqrt(1 - x²/4). Then A(x) = f(x) * g(x). The derivative A’(x) = f’(x) * g(x) + f(x) * g’(x).

First, compute f’(x). f(x) = (3/2)x, so f’(x) = 3/2.

Next, compute g’(x). g(x) = sqrt(1 - x²/4) = (1 - x²/4)^(1/2). The derivative is (1/2)(1 - x²/4)^(-1/2) * (-x/2) = (-x/4) / sqrt(1 - x²/4).
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Then area is (3*(sqrt(2)/2)/2) * sqrt(14)/4 = (3*sqrt(2)/4) * sqrt(14)/4 = 3*sqrt(28)/16 = 3*2*sqrt(7)/16 = 3*sqrt(7)/8. Which is the same as before. So that seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe using calculus. Let me set up the area function A(x) = (3x/2) * sqrt(1 - x²/4). To find maximum, take derivative A’(x). Let me compute that.

Let’s denote f(x) = (3x/2) * sqrt(1 - x²/4). Let’s write sqrt(1 - x²/4) as (1 - x²/4)^(1/2). Then, derivative is f’(x) = (3/2) * sqrt(1 - x²/4) + (3x/2) * (1/2) * (1 - x²/4)^(-1/2) * (-x/2). Let me compute that step by step.

First term: (3/2) * sqrt(1 - x²/4).

Second term: (3x/2) * (1/2) * (-x/2) * (1 - x²/4)^(-1/2) = (3x/2) * (-x/4) / sqrt(1 - x²/4) = (-3x²/8) / sqrt(1 - x²/4).

So total derivative:

f’(x) = (3/2) sqrt(1 - x²/4) - (3x²/8) / sqrt(1 - x²/4).

To combine terms, multiply numerator and denominator:

= [ (3/2)(1 - x²/4) - 3x²/8 ] / sqrt(1 - x²/4)

Compute numerator:

(3/2)(1 - x²/4) - 3x²/8 = 3/2 - 3x²/8 - 3x²/8 = 3/2 - 6x²/8 = 3/2 - 3x²/4.

Set numerator equal to zero:

3/2 - 3x²/4 = 0

Multiply both sides by 4:

6 - 3x² = 0 => 3x² = 6 => x² = 2 => x = sqrt(2). But x was defined as the shorter base, which must be positive, so x = sqrt(2). Wait, but earlier I had x = sqrt(2)/2. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, hold on. Let me check my derivative again. Maybe I messed up the algebra.

Wait, let's start over. Let me compute the derivative again.

f(x) = (3x/2) * sqrt(1 - x²/4)

Let’s write f(x) = (3x/2)(1 - x²/4)^(1/2)

Then, f’(x) = (3/2)(1 - x²/4)^(1/2) + (3x/2) * (1/2)(1 - x²/4)^(-1/2) * (-2x/4)

Simplify term by term:

First term: (3/2)(1 - x²/4)^(1/2)

Second term: (3x/2) * (1/2) * (-2x/4) * (1 - x²/4)^(-1/2)

Simplify the second term:

(3x/2) * (1/2) * (-2x/4) = (3x/2) * (-x/4) = -3x²/8

So the second term is (-3x²/8) / sqrt(1 - x²/4)

Therefore, total derivative:

f’(x) = (3/2) sqrt(1 - x²/4) - (3x²/8) / sqrt(1 - x²/4)

Combine terms:

Multiply numerator and denominator appropriately:

= [ (3/2)(1 - x²/4) - 3x²/8 ] / sqrt(1 - x²/4)

Compute numerator:

3/2*(1 - x²/4) - 3x²/8 = 3/2 - 3x²/8 - 3x²/8 = 3/2 - 6x²/8 = 3/2 - 3x²/4

Set numerator equal to zero:

3/2 - 3x²/4 = 0

Multiply both sides by 4:

6 - 3x² = 0 => 3x² = 6 => x² = 2 => x = sqrt(2)

Wait, but earlier when I solved for x, I had x = sqrt(2)/2. That was a mistake. Wait, let me check again.

Wait, in the initial steps, when I set the derivative to zero, I had:

(3/2)(1 - x²/4) - (3x²)/8 = 0

Multiply both sides by 8 to eliminate denominators:

12(1 - x²/4) - 3x² = 0

12 - 3x² - 3x² = 0 => 12 - 6x² = 0 => 6x² = 12 => x² = 2 => x = sqrt(2)

But in the previous calculation, I had x = sqrt(2)/2. That was incorrect. Wait, where did that come from? Wait, when I set h² = 1 - x²/4, then h = sqrt(1 - x²/4). Then, when I set up the area as (3x/2)*h, but when I took the derivative, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra. Wait, no, the derivative steps seem correct. So the critical point is at x = sqrt(2). But wait, if x = sqrt(2), then the longer base is 2x = 2*sqrt(2). But then, the difference in the bases is 2x - x = x = sqrt(2). Then, each right triangle has base (sqrt(2))/2. Then, the hypotenuse is 1, so h = sqrt(1 - (sqrt(2)/2)^2) = sqrt(1 - (2/4)) = sqrt(1 - 1/2) = sqrt(1/2) = 1/√2. Then, the area would be (3x/2)*h = (3*sqrt(2)/2)*(1/√2) = (3*sqrt(2)/2)*(sqrt(2)/2) = (3*2)/4 = 3/2.



But let me think again. If x = sqrt(2), then the longer base is 2*sqrt(2). The difference between the bases is sqrt(2), so each side extension is sqrt(2)/2. Then, the leg is 1, so h = sqrt(1 - (sqrt(2)/2)^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.5) = sqrt(0.5) = 1/√2. Then, the area is ( (sqrt(2) + 2*sqrt(2)) / 2 ) * (1/√2) = (3*sqrt(2)/2) * (1/√2) = 3/2. So that's correct. But the problem states that the legs are length 1. So if the height is 1/√2, then the legs would indeed be 1, because the legs are the hypotenuse of the right triangles with base sqrt(2)/2 and height 1/√2. Let's check that: (sqrt(2)/2)^2 + (1/√2)^2 = (2/4) + (1/2) = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1. So yes, the legs are length 1. So that checks out.

But in the previous calculation, I thought x was sqrt(2)/2, but that was incorrect. So the maximum area is 3/2, which is 3/2, so m=3, n=2, m² + n²=9 +4=13. So that's the answer. Therefore, the final answer is 13.
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
Then, the height h = 1 * sinθ, and the projection of the leg onto the base is 1 * cosθ. The difference in the bases is 2x - x = x, which is equal to 2 * (1 * cosθ). Therefore, x = 2 cosθ. Then, the area is (1/2)(x + 2x) * h = (3x/2) * h = (3*(2 cosθ)/2) * sinθ = 3 cosθ * sinθ = (3/2) sin(2θ). The maximum of sin(2θ) is 1, so maximum area is 3/2 * 1 = 3/2. Wait, that's different from the previous answer. Hmm, that suggests a contradiction. Which one is correct?

Wait, maybe I messed up the trigonometric approach. Let's check again. If we denote θ as the angle between the leg and the longer base, then the height h = 1*sinθ, and the horizontal component of the leg is 1*cosθ. Since the trapezoid is isosceles, the two sides extend the base by the same amount. So the difference in the bases is x = 2*(1 - cosθ)? Wait, no. Wait, the longer base is 2x, and the shorter base is x. The difference between the two bases is 2x - x = x. This difference is equal to 2*(1*cosθ), since each side projects a length of cosθ. Therefore, x = 2 cosθ. Then, the area is (x + 2x)/2 * h = (3x/2) * h = (3*(2 cosθ)/2) * sinθ = 3 cosθ * sinθ. So 3 cosθ sinθ = (3/2) sin(2θ). The maximum value of sin(2θ) is 1, so maximum area is 3/2. But this contradicts the previous answer of 3√14 / 8 ≈ 1.43.

Wait, so which one is correct? There must be a mistake here. Let me check both approaches again.

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.2:
Wait, but according to the trigonometric approach, the area is (3/2) sin(2θ), which is maximized at θ = 45 degrees, giving maximum area 3/2. So which one is correct?

Hmm, maybe there's a mistake in the trigonometric approach. Let me check. In the trigonometric approach, if θ is the angle between the leg and the longer base, then the height is h = 1*sinθ, and the horizontal component is 1*cosθ. Since the trapezoid is isosceles, the two sides extend the shorter base by the same amount. The longer base is 2x, the shorter is x, so the difference is x. This difference is equal to 2*(1*cosθ), because each side extends by 1*cosθ. Therefore, x = 2 cosθ. Then, the area is (x + 2x)/2 * h = (3x/2) * h = (3*(2 cosθ)/2) * sinθ = 3 cosθ * sinθ = (3/2) sin(2θ). So the maximum area is 3/2. But according to the calculus approach, the maximum area is 3/2 as well? Wait, but in the calculus approach, when x = sqrt(2), the area is (3*sqrt(2)/2)*(1/√2) = 3/2. So both methods give the same answer, 3/2. So then why did I get confused earlier?

Because in the calculus approach, x was the shorter base, so x = sqrt(2), which is approximately 1.414. Then, the longer base is 2x ≈ 2.828. The difference is x ≈ 1.414, so each side extension is x/2 ≈ 0.707. Then, h = sqrt(1 - (0.707)^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.5) = sqrt(0.5) ≈ 0.707. Then, area is (3*1.414/2)*0.707 ≈ (2.121)/2 * 0.707 ≈ 1.060 * 0.707 ≈ 0.75, but wait, that's not 3/2. Wait, this is conflicting.

Wait, hold on. Wait, if x = sqrt(2), then the shorter base is sqrt(2) ≈ 1.414, longer base is 2*sqrt(2) ≈ 2.828. The difference is 1.414, so each side extension is 0.707. Then, h = sqrt(1 - (0.707)^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.5) = sqrt(0.5) ≈ 0.707. Then, area is ( (sqrt(2) + 2*sqrt(2)) / 2 ) * h = (3*sqrt(2)/2) * 0.707 ≈ (3*1.414/2) * 0.707 ≈ (2.121) * 0.707 ≈ 1.5, which is 3/2. So that's correct. But when I thought x was sqrt(2)/2, that was a miscalculation. So both methods agree that the maximum area is 3/2.

But why did I think earlier that when x = sqrt(2)/2, the area was 3*sqrt(14)/8? Because in the calculus approach, I thought x was sqrt(2)/2, but actually, the critical point is at x = sqrt(2). Therefore, that was a mistake. So the correct maximum area is 3/2, which is 3/2, so m = 3, n = 2, so m² + n² = 9 + 4 = 13.

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
Wait, but let me check the problem statement again. It says "one base twice as long as the other". So if the shorter base is x, the longer is 2x. Then, the difference is x, so each side extension is x/2. Then, h = sqrt(1 - (x/2)^2). Then, area = (3x/2)*sqrt(1 - x²/4). Then, taking derivative, set to zero, get x = sqrt(2). Then, area is (3*sqrt(2)/2)*sqrt(1 - (sqrt(2)/2)^2) = (3*sqrt(2)/2)*sqrt(1 - 0.5) = (3*sqrt(2)/2)*(sqrt(0.5)) = (3*sqrt(2)/2)*(sqrt(2)/2) = (3*2)/4 = 3/2. So that's correct.
