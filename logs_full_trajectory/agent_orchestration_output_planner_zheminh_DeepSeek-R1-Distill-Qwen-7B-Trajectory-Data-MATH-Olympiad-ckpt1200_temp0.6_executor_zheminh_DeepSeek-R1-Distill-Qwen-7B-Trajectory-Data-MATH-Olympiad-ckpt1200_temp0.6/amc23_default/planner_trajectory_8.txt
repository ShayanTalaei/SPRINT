<Question>
Flora the frog starts at 0 on the number line and makes a sequence of jumps to the right. In any one jump, independent of previous jumps, Flora leaps a positive integer distance $m$ with probability $\frac{1}{2^m}$.
What is the probability that Flora will eventually land at 10? Write the answer as a simplified fraction $\frac{m}{n}$, find $m+n$
</Question>

<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to find the probability that Flora the frog will eventually land on 10. She starts at 0 and each time she jumps a positive integer distance m with probability 1/(2^m). The jumps are independent, so each jump doesn't depend on the previous ones. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. Flora starts at 0. Each jump she makes is some positive integer m, chosen with probability 1/2^m. So the possible jumps are 1, 2, 3, etc. , each with probabilities 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, and so on. The question is asking for the probability that at some point in the sequence of jumps, she lands exactly on 10. So we need the probability that there exists some finite number of jumps such that the sum of those jumps is 10.

Wait, but since the frog can keep jumping forever, even if she doesn't land on 10 initially, she might land there in some later jump.

So the probability is not just the probability that she reaches 10 in one jump, but the probability that she ever reaches 10 at some point, regardless of how many jumps it takes. That makes sense.

So how do we model this? It seems like a problem that might involve recursion or generating functions. Maybe we can model the probability of reaching 10 from any position k, and then set up recursive equations for those probabilities.

Based on execution_1.1:
Let's denote P(k) as the probability that Flora eventually reaches 10 starting from position k. Then, we want to find P(0).

<prompt_2.1> Define the recursive relationship for the probability of reaching position 10 from any position k. </prompt_2.1>
-----

But let me check with another approach. Maybe using generating functions or expectation.

Alternatively, think of it as the expected number of times she visits 10. But since we only need the probability that she visits 10 at least once, which is 1 minus the probability that she never visits 10. So maybe we can compute the probability that she never reaches 10 and subtract that from 1. But how?

<prompt_2.2> Consider an alternative approach to calculate the probability of never visiting 10 and subtract it from 1. </prompt_2.2>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
For position k = 10, P(10) = 1, because she's already there. For position k > 10, P(k) = 0, because she can't go backwards, and once she's past 10, she can't land on 10. For positions k < 10, the probability P(k) is the sum over all possible jumps m from k to some position k + m, weighted by their probabilities. So, for k < 10, we have:

P(k) = sum_{m=1}^{âˆž} [ (1/2^m) * P(k + m) ]

But wait, if she jumps from k to k + m, and k + m might be less than, equal to, or greater than 10.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
If we let Q(k) be the probability that starting from position k, she never reaches 10. Then the desired probability is 1 - Q(0). So maybe computing Q(k) is easier?

But how do we compute Q(k)? If we start at k, the frog can jump some m, landing at k + m. If k + m = 10, then Q(k) = 0. If k + m < 10, then she has to never reach 10 from k + m. If k + m > 10, then she also never reaches 10. Wait, but if k + m > 10, then she overshoots 10, so she can't reach 10 anymore, right? Because she's jumping to the right each time. So if she jumps over 10, she can't come back. Therefore, once she jumps over 10, she can't reach 10. So for k >= 10, Q(k) = 0. For k < 10, Q(k) is the probability that she either jumps over 10 or lands exactly on 10. But since she can't jump left, once she goes past 10, she can't come back. Therefore, for k < 10, Q(k) = probability that she never reaches 10, which would be the probability that her first jump is m such that k + m > 10, plus the probability that she jumps to k + m < 10 and then never reaches 10 from there.

Wait, that seems similar to the original recursion. So Q(k) = sum_{m=1}^{10 - k - 1} Q(k + m) * (1/2^m) + sum_{m=10 - k + 1}^\infty (1/2^m). But the second sum is the probability that she jumps over 10, which is 1 - sum_{m=1}^{10 - k} (1/2^m). But since once she jumps over, she can't reach 10, so Q(k) = sum_{m=1}^{10 - k - 1} Q(k + m) * (1/2^m) + sum_{m=10 - k + 1}^\infty (1/2^m). But this seems recursive and complicated.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that the probability of eventually reaching 10 is the sum over all possible numbers of jumps that add up to 10, each multiplied by their probabilities. But that seems difficult because there are infinitely many ways to sum to 10 with positive integers. For example, 1+1+...+1 ten times, or 2+8, etc. , each with different probabilities.

Wait, but maybe there's a generating function approach here. Let's recall that generating functions can be used for sums of independent random variables. The generating function for a single jump is G(x) = sum_{m=1}^\infty (x^m)/2^m = x/(2 - x). Then, the generating function for the sum of n jumps would be G(x)^n. However, we want the probability that the sum of some number of jumps equals 10. So the generating function for all possible sums is the sum over n >=1 of G(x)^n = G(x)/(1 - G(x)) = [x/(2 - x)] / [1 - x/(2 - x)] = [x/(2 - x)] / [(2 - x - x)/(2 - x)] = x/(2 - 2x). Therefore, the generating function for the sum of any number of jumps is x/(2 - 2x). But the coefficient of x^10 in this generating function would be the probability that the sum of some number of jumps is exactly 10. But let's check:

Wait, the generating function for the sum of n jumps is G(x)^n. The total generating function for all possible numbers of jumps is sum_{n=1}^\infty G(x)^n = G(x)/(1 - G(x)) = (x/(2 - x))/(1 - x/(2 - x)) = (x/(2 - x)) / ((2 - x - x)/(2 - x)) ) = x/(2 - 2x). So the coefficient of x^10 in x/(2 - 2x) is the probability that the sum is 10. Let's compute that.

The generating function x/(2 - 2x) can be written as (1/2)x * sum_{k=0}^\infty (2x/2)^k = (1/2)x * sum_{k=0}^\infty x^k = (1/2)x * [1/(1 - x)] for |x| < 1. Therefore, the coefficient of x^10 is (1/2) * 1 = 1/2. Wait, but that can't be. The coefficient of x^10 in x/(2 - 2x) is (1/2) times the coefficient of x^9 in 1/(1 - x), which is (1/2)*1 = 1/2. But that would imply the probability is 1/2, which contradicts our earlier result of 10/31. So something is wrong here.

Based on execution_2.1:
So P(k) = sum_{m=1}^{10 - k} [ (1/2^m) * P(k + m) ] + sum_{m=10 - k + 1}^\infty [ (1/2^m) * 0 ]

<prompt_3.1> Set up the recursive equation for P(k) and simplify it. </prompt_3.1>
-----

Based on execution_2.2:
Wait, but that seems conflicting. Maybe the generating function approach is incorrect here. Let me think again. The generating function G(x) = x/(2 - x) is the generating function for a single jump. Then, the generating function for the sum of any number of jumps is indeed G(x)/(1 - G(x)).

<prompt_3.2> Re-evaluate the generating function approach and identify the error. </prompt_3.2>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
Because for m from 1 to 10 - k, she jumps to k + m, which is less than 10, and then from there she needs to reach 10. For m >= 10 - k + 1, she jumps over 10, so she can't reach 10 anymore, hence those terms contribute 0. So the equation simplifies to:

P(k) = sum_{m=1}^{10 - k} [ (1/2^m) * P(k + m) ]

for k = 0, 1, 2, ...., 9

And for k >= 10, P(k) = 1 if k = 10, else 0.

Wait, but actually, when k + m = 10, then P(k + m) = 1. So maybe we can write the equation as:

For k < 10:

P(k) = sum_{m=1}^{10 - k} [ (1/2^m) * P(k + m) ] + sum_{m=10 - k + 1}^\infty [ (1/2^m) * 0 ]

But the second sum is zero, so it's just the first sum. However, when k + m = 10, then P(k + m) = 1. So more precisely:

For k < 10:

P(k) = sum_{m=1}^{10 - k} [ (1/2^m) * P(k + m) ]

But when m = 10 - k, then k + m = 10, so P(k + m) = 1. So:

P(k) = sum_{m=1}^{10 - k - 1} [ (1/2^m) * P(k + m) ] + (1/2^{10 - k}) * 1

That's a more accurate expression. So each P(k) is the sum of the probabilities of jumping to positions k + m (for m from 1 to 9 - k) multiplied by their respective P(k + m) values, plus the probability of jumping exactly to 10, which is 1/2^{10 - k}.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
So that is x/(2 - x) divided by 1 - x/(2 - x) = x/(2 - x - x) = x/(2 - 2x). So the generating function is x/(2 - 2x). Then, the coefficient of x^10 in this generating function would be the probability that the sum is 10. Let's compute that. The generating function x/(2 - 2x) can be written as (1/2)x * sum_{k=0}^\infty (x)^k = (1/2)x/(1 - x). So the coefficient of x^10 is (1/2)*1 = 1/2. But that contradicts our earlier result. So there must be a mistake here. Maybe the generating function approach isn't directly applicable here because the problem is about the sum being exactly 10 in some number of steps, but the generating function x/(2 - 2x) actually represents the generating function for the sum of any number of jumps, but perhaps we need to consider the probability generating function for the first passage time to 10.

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
This seems recursive. Let's start from k = 9 and work our way down to k = 0.

<prompt_4.1> Calculate P(9), P(8), and so on down to P(0) using the recursive formula. </prompt_4.1>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
Starting with k = 9:

P(9) = sum_{m=1}^{10 - 9 - 1} [ (1/2^m) * P(9 + m) ] + (1/2^{10 - 9}) * 1

But 10 - 9 - 1 = 0, so the first sum is from m=1 to 0, which is empty. So P(9) = 0 + (1/2^1) * 1 = 1/2.

Similarly, for k = 8:

P(8) = sum_{m=1}^{10 - 8 - 1} [ (1/2^m) * P(8 + m) ] + (1/2^{10 - 8}) * 1

10 - 8 - 1 = 1, so m=1:

P(8) = (1/2^1) * P(9) + (1/2^2) * 1 = (1/2)*(1/2) + (1/4)*1 = 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2.

Wait, that's interesting. Let's check:

Wait, 10 - 8 - 1 = 1, so m can be 1. So:

P(8) = (1/2^1)*P(9) + (1/2^{2})*1 = (1/2)*(1/2) + (1/4) = 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2.

Similarly, for k = 7:

10 - 7 - 1 = 2, so m = 1 and 2.

P(7) = (1/2^1)*P(8) + (1/2^2)*P(9) + (1/2^3)*1

= (1/2)*(1/2) + (1/4)*(1/2) + (1/8)*1

= 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/8 = 1/4 + 2/8 = 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2.

Wait, again 1/2? Hmm, let me check again.

Wait, 10 - 7 - 1 = 2, so m = 1 and 2. Then the sum is (1/2^1)*P(8) + (1/2^2)*P(9). Then adding the term for m=3, which is 10 - 7 = 3, so m=3: (1/2^3)*1.

So total:

(1/2)*(1/2) + (1/4)*(1/2) + (1/8)*1 = 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/8 = 1/4 + 2/8 = 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2.

So P(7) = 1/2.

Wait, this seems like a pattern. Let's test another one. For k = 6:

10 - 6 - 1 = 3, so m=1,2,3.

P(6) = (1/2^1)*P(7) + (1/2^2)*P(8) + (1/2^3)*P(9) + (1/2^4)*1

= (1/2)*(1/2) + (1/4)*(1/2) + (1/8)*(1/2) + (1/16)*1

= 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + 1/16

= 1/4 + 1/8 + 2/16 = 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/8 = 1/4 + 2/8 = 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2.

Again 1/2. Hmm, so is this a pattern that P(k) = 1/2 for all k < 10? Let's check for k=0.

If this pattern holds, then P(0) should also be 1/2. But wait, let's verify with k=5:

10 - 5 - 1 = 4, so m=1,2,3,4.

P(5) = sum_{m=1}^4 (1/2^m)*P(5 + m) + (1/2^5)*1

So compute each term:

m=1: (1/2)*P(6) = (1/2)*(1/2) = 1/4

m=2: (1/4)*P(7) = (1/4)*(1/2) = 1/8

m=3: (1/8)*P(8) = (1/8)*(1/2) = 1/16

m=4: (1/16)*P(9) = (1/16)*(1/2) = 1/32

Then add the term for m=5: (1/32)*1 = 1/32

Total:

1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + 1/32 + 1/32

Convert to 32 denominators:

8/32 + 4/32 + 2/32 + 1/32 + 1/32 = (8 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 1)/32 = 16/32 = 1/2.

So P(5) = 1/2. Hmm, this seems to hold. So is it possible that for all k < 10, P(k) = 1/2?

<Plan_5>
Based on execution_4.1:
Then P(0) = 1/2.

But that seems counterintuitive. Intuitively, if the frog can jump over 10 with some probability, then the probability of landing on 10 should be less than 1. But here, according to this recursion, it's 1/2.

<prompt_5.1> Verify the recursive formula and check if the pattern P(k) = 1/2 for all k < 10 holds. </prompt_5.1>

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
Let me check for k=10: P(10)=1. For k=11: P(11)=0. So for k=9, m can only be 1, which jumps to 10, so P(9) = 1/2. For k=8, m=1 jumps to 9 (P=1/2) and m=2 jumps over to 10 (1/4). So total P(8) = 1/2*(1/2) + 1/4*1 = 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2. Similarly for k=7, m=1 jumps to 8 (1/2), m=2 jumps to 9 (1/2), m=3 jumps over (1/8). So P(7) = 1/2*(1/2) + 1/4*(1/2) + 1/8*1 = 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/8 = 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2. So this pattern seems to hold.

Therefore, if this pattern is correct, then P(k) = 1/2 for all k < 10. Therefore, P(0) = 1/2.

</Execution_5>

<Plan_6>
Based on execution_5.1:
Therefore, the probability is 1/2, so m + n = 1 + 2 = 3.

But wait, this seems too simple. Let me verify again.

Wait, but when k=9, she can jump 1 to reach 10 with probability 1/2, or jump 2 to reach 11 with probability 1/4, or jump 3 to reach 12 with probability 1/8, etc. , each time summing to 1/2. So the probability of reaching 10 is 1/2, and the probability of jumping over is also 1/2. Similarly, for k=8, half the time she jumps to 9 (which has P=1/2) and half the time she jumps over to 10 or beyond. So recursively, each P(k) = 1/2. Therefore, the answer is 1/2, so 1 + 2 = 3.

But let me check with another approach. Let's consider that for any k < 10, the probability of eventually reaching 10 is 1/2. Then, starting from 0, the probability is 1/2. Alternatively, maybe there's a symmetry here. Since each jump is memoryless, the process is a Markov chain, and the probability of reaching 10 before jumping over is 1/2. Maybe that's why it's 1/2.

<prompt_6.1> Reflect on the recursive pattern and verify if the probability of reaching 10 is indeed 1/2 for all k < 10. </prompt_6.1>
</Plan_6>

<Execution_6>
<execution_6.1>
Alternatively, think of it as a fair game where each jump has a certain probability to land on 10 or to overshoot. If each jump has a 1/2 chance to land on 10 from any position below 10, then the probability is 1/2. But that seems too simplistic.

Alternatively, consider that the process is equivalent to a fair game where the frog either reaches 10 with probability 1/2 or overshoots with probability 1/2. Therefore, the answer is 1/2. But I need to be careful here. Let me think again.

Wait, when k=9, the probability to reach 10 is 1/2. When k=8, the probability is 1/2. Similarly, for all k < 10, it's 1/2. Therefore, starting from 0, which is k=0, the probability is 1/2. Therefore, the answer is 1/2, so m + n = 3.

Based on execution_6.1:
But let me check with another value. Let's take k=1. Then P(1) = sum_{m=1}^{9} (1/2^m)*P(1 + m) + (1/2^{10})*1.

<prompt_7.1> Verify the recursive formula for P(k) with k=1 and calculate the probability of reaching 10. </prompt_7.1>

But since P(k) = 1/2 for all k < 10, then:

P(1) = sum_{m=1}^9 (1/2^m)*(1/2) + (1/2^{10})*1

= (1/2) * sum_{m=1}^9 (1/2^m) + 1/2^{10}

Compute sum_{m=1}^9 (1/2^m) = 1 - 1/2^9. Therefore:

P(1) = (1/2)*(1 - 1/512) + 1/1024

= (1/2) - 1/1024 + 1/1024 = 1/2.

So that's correct. Similarly, for any k < 10, P(k) = 1/2.

Therefore, the answer is 1/2, so m + n = 1 + 2 = 3.

<execution_8.1>
Suppose the frog starts at position 0. The probability that she reaches 10 is 1/2. Let me think of it as a fair game. Each time she jumps, there's a 1/2 chance she reaches 10 on that jump, and a 1/2 chance she jumps over. But this is not exactly fair because the probability of jumping over depends on the current position. Wait, but according to the recursion, regardless of the current position (as long as it's less than 10), the probability is 1/2. So starting from any position k < 10, the probability is 1/2. Therefore, starting from 0, the probability is 1/2.

But let me think of it differently. The expected number of times she reaches 10 is something else, but we're only interested in whether she reaches it at least once. So the probability is 1/2. Therefore, the answer is 1/2, so m + n = 3.

<Plan_9>
Based on execution_8.1:
But wait, this seems counterintuitive. Let me test with a smaller number. Suppose instead of 10, we have target 1. Then, starting at 0, the probability of landing on 1 is 1/2 (jump 1) + 1/4 (jump 2) + 1/8 (jump 3) + ... = sum_{m=1}^\infty (1/2^m) = 1. So the probability is 1. So that makes sense. If the target is 1, she will eventually land on it with probability 1. Wait, but according to our previous formula, P(0) = 1/2 for target 10. But for target 1, it's 1. Hmm, so there's a discrepancy here. Wait, no. Wait, in the case of target 1, starting at 0, the probability to land on 1 is 1. Because in one jump, she can jump 1 with probability 1/2, or jump higher with probability 1/2, but if she jumps higher, she can't go back. Wait, but according to the previous recursion, P(0) would be sum_{m=1}^0 ... which is not defined. Wait, maybe the recursion is different for target 1.

Wait, in the case of target 1, starting at 0, the probability to reach 1 is 1/2 (jump 1) + sum_{m=2}^\infty 1/2^m * 0 = 1/2. But actually, if she jumps 2 or higher from 0, she can't reach 1 anymore. So the probability should be 1/2, not 1. Wait, this contradicts my previous thought. Wait, let's recalculate.

If the target is 1, starting at 0:

P(0) = sum_{m=1}^{1} (1/2^m) * P(0 + m) + sum_{m=2}^\infty (1/2^m) * 0

But P(1) = 1, so P(0) = (1/2)*1 + sum_{m=2}^\infty (1/2^m)*0 = 1/2. So the probability is 1/2, not 1. So my initial thought was wrong. So the probability of reaching 1 is 1/2, not 1. So that corrects my previous misunderstanding.

Therefore, going back to the original problem, the probability of reaching 10 is 1/2. So the answer is 1/2, so m + n = 3.
