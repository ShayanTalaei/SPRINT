Each row after the first row is formed by placing a 1 at each end of the row, and each interior entry is 1 greater than the sum of the two numbers diagonally above it in the previous row. What is the units digits of the sum of the 2023 numbers in the 2023rd row?

<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to figure out the units digit of the sum of the numbers in the 2023rd row of this triangular array. Let me start by understanding the problem better.

<prompt_1.1> Analyze the problem statement and understand the structure of the triangular array. Determine what needs to be found (the units digit of the sum of the 2023rd row). </prompt_1.1>

<execution_1.1>
First, the rows given are:

Row 1: 1

Row 2: 1 1

Row 3: 1 3 1

Row 4: 1 5 5 1

Row 5: 1 7 11 7 1

Each row starts and ends with 1. The interior entries are formed by a rule: each interior entry is 1 greater than the sum of the two numbers diagonally above it in the previous row. Let me verify this with the given rows. For example, in Row 3, the middle entry is 3. According to the rule, the two numbers diagonally above would be the entries in Row 2: 1 and 1. Their sum is 2, and adding 1 gives 3, which matches. Similarly, in Row 4, the two interior entries are 5 and 5. The numbers diagonally above in Row 3 are 1 and 3 for the first 5, and 3 and 1 for the second 5. The sums are 4 and 4, adding 1 gives 5 each. That works too. So the rule seems to hold.

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Now, the question is about the sum of the numbers in the 2023rd row, specifically the units digit of that sum.

First, let's try to find a pattern in the sums of the rows. Let me compute the sums for the first few rows and see if there's a pattern.

<prompt_2.1> Compute the sums of the first few rows and look for a pattern in the sums to possibly generalize for larger rows. </prompt_2.1>
-----

But let me verify this with the given rows to make sure.

<prompt_2.2> Verify the pattern for the sum of the first few rows and confirm the general formula for the sum of the nth row. </prompt_2.2>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Row 1: 1 → sum = 1

Row 2: 1 + 1 = 2

Row 3: 1 + 3 + 1 = 5

Row 4: 1 + 5 + 5 + 1 = 12

Row 5: 1 + 7 + 11 + 7 + 1 = 27

Let me write down these sums:

Row 1: 1

Row 2: 2

Row 3: 5

Row 4: 12

Row 5: 27

Hmm, let's see if there's a pattern here. Let me check the differences between consecutive sums:

Row 2 - Row 1: 2 - 1 = 1

Row 3 - Row 2: 5 - 2 = 3

Row 4 - Row 3: 12 - 5 = 7

Row 5 - Row 4: 27 - 12 = 15

So the differences are 1, 3, 7, 15. These numbers look familiar. Each difference is 2^n - 1. Let's check:

For difference after Row 1 (which is between Row 2 and Row 1): 2^1 - 1 = 1, which matches.

After Row 2: 2^2 - 1 = 3, which matches.

After Row 3: 2^3 - 1 = 7, yes.

After Row 4: 2^4 - 1 = 15, correct.

So the difference between the sum of row n and row n-1 is 2^(n-1) - 1. Wait, let's check:

Wait, the difference after Row 1 (sum of Row 2 - Row1) is 1, which is 2^1 -1. Then difference after Row2 (Row3 - Row2) is 3 = 2^2 -1. Then 7 = 2^3 -1, 15=2^4 -1. So in general, the difference between sum of row n and row n-1 is 2^(n-1) -1. Therefore, the sum of row n can be expressed as the sum of row 1 plus the sum of the differences up to that point.

So sum(n) = sum(n-1) + (2^(n-1) -1). But this is a recursive relation. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for sum(n).

Alternatively, let's compute the sum(n) directly.

Given the recursive relation:

sum(n) = sum(n-1) + 2^(n-1) -1

With sum(1) = 1.

Let's compute sum(n) step by step:

sum(1) = 1

sum(2) = 1 + (2^1 -1) = 1 +1 =2

sum(3) = 2 + (2^2 -1) = 2 +3=5

sum(4) =5 + (2^3 -1)=5 +7=12

sum(5)=12 + (2^4 -1)=12 +15=27

Which matches the given rows. So this recursive formula is correct.

But to get a closed-form formula, let's expand the recursion.

sum(n) = sum(1) + sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (2^k -1)

Because each step from 2 to n adds 2^(k) -1 where k is from 1 to n-1.

So sum(n) = 1 + sum_{k=1}^{n-1} 2^k - sum_{k=1}^{n-1} 1

Compute each part:

sum_{k=1}^{n-1} 2^k is a geometric series. The sum of 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^{n-1} = 2(2^{n-1} -1)/(2 -1) )= 2^{n} - 2.

sum_{k=1}^{n-1} 1 = (n-1)

Therefore, sum(n) = 1 + (2^{n} - 2) - (n -1) = 1 +2^n -2 -n +1 = 2^n - n

Wait, let me check:

sum(n) =1 + (2^{n} -2) - (n -1)

Compute:

1 +2^n -2 -n +1 = (1 -2 +1) +2^n -n = 0 +2^n -n =2^n -n

Yes, that's correct.

So sum(n) =2^n -n

Sum of Row 1: 1

Sum of Row 2: 1 + 1 = 2

Sum of Row 3: 1 + 3 + 1 = 5

Sum of Row 4: 1 + 5 + 5 + 1 = 12

Sum of Row 5: 1 + 7 + 11 + 7 + 1 = 27

Wait, let me check these sums again:

Row 1: 1

Row 2: 1+1=2

Row 3: 1+3+1=5

Row 4: 1+5+5+1=12

Row 5: 1+7+11+7+1=27

Hmm, 1, 2, 5, 12, 27. Let me see if these numbers follow a pattern. Let's look at the differences between consecutive terms:

From 1 to 2: +1

From 2 to 5: +3

From 5 to 12: +7

From 12 to 27: +15

Ah, the differences are 1, 3, 7, 15. These numbers are one less than powers of 2: 2^1 -1=1, 2^2 -1=3, 2^3 -1=7, 2^4 -1=15. So the difference between the sum of row n and row n-1 is 2^{n-1} -1.

Wait, let's check:

Difference between Row 2 and Row 1: 2 - 1 =1=2^1 -1=1. Correct.

Difference between Row 3 and Row 2:5 -2=3=2^2 -1=3. Correct.

Difference between Row 4 and Row 3:12 -5=7=2^3 -1=7. Correct.

Difference between Row 5 and Row 4:27 -12=15=2^4 -1=15. Correct.

So the difference between the sum of row n and row n-1 is 2^{n-1} -1. Therefore, the sum of row n can be expressed as the sum of row 1 plus the sum of all these differences up to row n-1.

But maybe there's a closed-form formula for the sum of the nth row. Let's see.

Alternatively, let's denote S(n) as the sum of the nth row. Then, according to the differences:

S(n) = S(n-1) + 2^{n-1} -1

With S(1)=1.

This is a recursive relation. Let's try to solve it.

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Therefore, the sum of the 2023rd row is 2^2023 - 2023. We need the units digit of this number.

So the problem reduces to finding the units digit of 2^2023 - 2023.

<prompt_3.1> Using the formula sum(n) = 2^n - n, find the units digit of the sum of the 2023rd row. </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
To find the units digit, we can compute 2^2023 modulo 10 and 2023 modulo 10, then subtract the two results modulo 10.

First, let's compute the units digit of 2^2023. The units digits of powers of 2 cycle every 4:

2^1 = 2 → units digit 2

2^2 = 4 → units digit 4

2^3 = 8 → units digit 8

2^4 = 16 → units digit 6

2^5 = 32 → units digit 2

... and so on. The cycle is 2, 4, 8, 6, repeating every 4. So the units digit of 2^n depends on n modulo 4.

2023 divided by 4: 2023 ÷ 4 = 505 * 4 + 3. So 2023 ≡ 3 mod 4. Therefore, the units digit of 2^2023 is the same as 2^3, which is 8.

Next, compute the units digit of 2023. That's 3.

Therefore, the units digit of 2^2023 - 2023 is (8 - 3) mod 10 = 5 mod 10 = 5. However, we need to be careful here. If the subtraction results in a negative number, we have to add 10. For example, if we had 2^1 - 2023, which is 2 - 2023 = -2021, units digit would be 9 (since -2021 ≡ -1 mod 10 ≡ 9 mod 10). But in our case, 8 - 3 = 5, which is positive, so the units digit is 5.

Wait, but let me double-check. Let's verify with smaller n to see if the formula holds.

For example, let's check n=1:

sum(1)=1=2^1 -1=2-1=1. Correct.

n=2: sum=2=2^2 -2=4-2=2. Correct.

n=3: sum=5=8 -3=5. Correct.

n=4: sum=12=16 -4=12. Correct.

n=5: sum=27=32 -5=27. Correct.

So the formula works. Therefore, the formula sum(n)=2^n -n is correct. Therefore, the sum of the 2023rd row is 2^2023 -2023. So the units digit is (2^2023 mod10) - (2023 mod10) mod10. As we calculated, 2^2023 mod10=8, 2023 mod10=3, so 8 -3=5. Therefore, units digit is 5.

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
Wait, but let me check another example to ensure that the formula works.

<prompt_4.1> Verify the formula sum(n) = 2^n - n with the given examples and confirm the units digit of the sum of the 2023rd row. </prompt_4.1>

But let me check again with the formula.

sum(n) =2^n -n.

<prompt_4.2> Re-confirm the formula sum(n) = 2^n - n and verify the units digit of the sum of the 2023rd row. </prompt_4.2>

But wait, let me check if the formula is correct for another row. Let's take row 6.

<prompt_4.3> Use the formula sum(n) = 2^n - n to compute the sum of the 6th row and verify it using the given rule for the triangle. </prompt_4.3>

But just to be thorough, let me think if there's any other aspect I might have missed.

<prompt_4.4> Reflect on the problem and confirm the solution for the units digit of the sum of the 2023rd row. </prompt_4.4>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
For example, n=5: sum=27. 2^5=32, 32 -5=27. Correct.

n=4: 16 -4=12. Correct.

So the formula seems valid. Therefore, applying it for n=2023 should be correct.

Therefore, the units digit is 5.
</execution_4.1>

<execution_4.2>
For n=1: 2 -1=1. Correct.

n=2:4 -2=2. Correct.

n=3:8 -3=5. Correct.

n=4:16 -4=12. Correct.

n=5:32 -5=27. Correct.

So the formula holds. Therefore, for n=2023, sum=2^2023 -2023. Units digit is (2^2023 mod10) - (2023 mod10) mod10.

2^2023 mod10: as we said, cycle of 2,4,8,6 every 4. 2023 divided by4 is 505*4 +3, so remainder 3. So 2^3=8. So 8 mod10=8.

2023 mod10=3.

Therefore, 8 -3=5. Since 5 is positive, the units digit is 5.
</execution_4.2>

<execution_4.3>
According to the formula, sum(6)=2^6 -6=64 -6=58.

Let's compute the 6th row. Wait, the problem only gives up to row 5. Let me try to compute row 6 using the given rule.

Row 5: 1 7 11 7 1

To compute row 6, we start and end with 1. The interior entries are each 1 greater than the sum of the two numbers diagonally above in the previous row.

So the interior entries in row 6 will be:

First interior: 1 +7 +1=9? Wait, no. Wait, the rule is each interior entry is 1 greater than the sum of the two numbers diagonally above it in the previous row. So in row 5, each pair of adjacent numbers is (1,7), (7,11), (11,7), (7,1). So for row 6, the first interior entry is above the first two numbers of row 5: 1 and 7. Their sum is 8, add 1 gives 9.

Second interior entry: 7 and 11. Sum is 18, add 1 gives 19.

Third interior entry: 11 and 7. Sum is 18, add 1 gives 19.

Fourth interior entry:7 and 1. Sum is 8, add 1 gives 9.

So row 6: 1,9,19,19,9,1. Sum is 1+9+19+19+9+1= 1+9=10, 10+19=29, 29+19=48, 48+9=57, 57+1=58. Which matches the formula sum(6)=2^6 -6=64-6=58.

So the formula works for row 6. Therefore, the formula sum(n)=2^n -n is correct.
</execution_4.3>

<execution_4.4>
For example, does the formula hold for all n? Let's check n=6.

If we can compute the 6th row, then we can check the sum.

But the problem is that generating the 6th row would take time, but let's try.

Row 6:

Starts and ends with 1. The interior entries (positions 2,3,4,5) are each 1 greater than the sum of the two numbers diagonally above in the previous row. The previous row (Row5) is 1 7 11 7 1.

So for position 2 in Row6: diagonally above is 1 (from Row5, position1) and 7 (from Row5, position2). Sum is 1+7=8, plus 1 is 9.

Position3 in Row6: diagonally above is 7 (Row5, position2) and 11 (Row5, position3). Sum is 7+11=18, plus 1 is 19.

Position4 in Row6: diagonally above is 11 (Row5, position3) and 7 (Row5, position4). Sum is 11+7=18, plus 1 is 19.

Position5 in Row6: diagonally above is 7 (Row5, position4) and 1 (Row5, position5). Sum is 7+1=8, plus 1 is 9.

So Row6 is 1 9 19 19 9 1. Sum is 1+9+19+19+9+1= 1+9=10, 10+19=29, 29+19=48, 48+9=57, 57+1=58. So sum=58.

According to the formula sum(6)=2^6 -6=64 -6=58. Correct.

Therefore, the formula holds. So sum(n)=2^n -n. Therefore, the units digit of sum(2023) is (2^2023 mod10) - (2023 mod10) mod10. As we calculated, 2^2023 mod10=8, 2023 mod10=3, so 8-3=5. Therefore, the units digit is 5.
</execution_4.4>
</Execution_4>

<Plan_5>
Based on execution_4.2, execution_4.4:
Therefore, the units digit of the sum of the 2023rd row is 5.

But just to be thorough, let me check another example.

<prompt_5.1> Verify the units digit of the sum of the 2023rd row with another example and confirm the final answer. </prompt_5.1>
</Plan_5>

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
Take n=6, sum=58. 2^6=64, 64-6=58. Correct. Units digit 8. 2023 mod10=3, 8-3=5. Correct.

Another example, n=7.

sum(7)=2^7 -7=128 -7=121. Units digit 1.

Let's compute the sum of the 7th row using the rule. Previous row (Row6):1 9 19 19 9 1.

Row7: starts and ends with 1. Interior entries:

Position2: 1+9 +1=11? Wait, no. Wait, the rule is each interior entry is 1 greater than the sum of the two numbers diagonally above it in the previous row.

So for Row7, the interior entries are:

Position2: sum of Row6 positions1 and2:1 +9=10, +1=11.

Position3: sum of Row6 positions2 and3:9 +19=28, +1=29.

Position4: sum of Row6 positions3 and4:19 +19=38, +1=39.

Position5: sum of Row6 positions4 and5:19 +9=28, +1=29.

Position6: sum of Row6 positions5 and6:9 +1=10, +1=11.

So Row7:1 11 29 39 29 11 1. Sum is 1+11=12, 12+29=41, 41+39=80, 80+29=109, 109+11=120, 120+1=121. Correct. Units digit 1. Which matches 2^7 -7=128-7=121, units digit 1. Correct.

Therefore, the formula works. Therefore, for n=2023, the units digit is 5.
</execution_5.1>

<Plan_6>
Based on execution_5.1:
Therefore, the answer is 5.

But just to be absolutely sure, let me check the cycle of 2^n mod10 again.

<prompt_6.1> Verify the cycle of 2^n mod 10 and confirm the final answer for the units digit of the sum of the 2023rd row. </prompt_6.1>
</Plan_6>

<Execution_6>
<execution_6.1>
2^1=2, 2^2=4, 2^3=8, 2^4=6, 2^5=2, and so on. So cycle length 4. 2023 divided by 4: 2023 ÷4=505*4 +3. So remainder 3. Therefore, 2^3=8. So units digit of 2^2023 is 8. Correct.

2023 mod10=3. Therefore, 8-3=5. Correct.

Therefore, the units digit is 5. I think that's solid.
