Okay, so I need to figure out how many positive perfect squares less than 2023 are divisible by 5. Hmm, let's start by breaking down the problem step by step.

First, a perfect square is a number that's the square of an integer. So, numbers like 1, 4, 9, 16, etc. Now, the question is asking for those perfect squares that are less than 2023 and also divisible by 5.

Alright, so first, maybe I should recall that if a number is divisible by 5, it must end with a 0 or 5. But since we're dealing with perfect squares, the last digit of the square can only be certain digits. Let me think. The possible last digits of perfect squares are 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9. So, if a perfect square is divisible by 5, its last digit must be 0 or 5. Because 5 is already a prime number, and for a number to be divisible by 5, it must have 5 as a factor. So, the square root of such a number must also be divisible by 5, right? Because if a square is divisible by 5, then its square root must be divisible by 5 as well. Let me confirm that.

Yes, if n² is divisible by 5, then n must be divisible by 5. Because 5 is prime, so if 5 divides n², then 5 divides n. So, that means n is a multiple of 5. Therefore, the square of a multiple of 5 will end with 0 or 5. For example, 10² = 100, 15² = 225, 20² = 400, etc. So, that seems to check out.

Based on execution_1.1:
So, maybe the problem reduces to finding all multiples of 5 whose squares are less than 2023. Let me formalize that.

Let’s denote the perfect square as (5k)², where k is a positive integer. Then, we need (5k)² < 2023.

<prompt_2.1> Using the above plan, express the perfect square as (5k)² and derive the inequality (5k)² < 2023. Then solve for k to find the range of valid k values. </prompt_2.1>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Let's expand that: 25k² < 2023. Then, solving for k², we get k² < 2023 / 25. Let me compute 2023 divided by 25. 25 times 80 is 2000, so 2023 - 2000 = 23. So, 2023 / 25 = 80.92. Therefore, k² < 80.92. Since k must be an integer, k² ≤ 80. So, k can be at most the integer part of sqrt(80). What's sqrt(80)? That's approximately 8.944. So, the largest integer k is 8. Therefore, k can be 1, 2, 3, ...., 8. So, there are 8 possible values of k. Therefore, there are 8 perfect squares that are multiples of 25 (since (5k)² = 25k²) and less than 2023.

Based on execution_2.1:
Wait, but let me check if this is correct. Let me verify by calculating each (5k)² for k from 1 to 8 and see if they are less than 2023.

<prompt_3.1> Using the above plan, calculate (5k)² for k = 1 to 8 and verify if each is less than 2023. </prompt_3.1>

But wait, let me check if k=8 gives (5*8)^2 = 40^2 = 1600, which is indeed less than 2023. Then k=9 would be 45^2=2025, which is more than 2023. So, yes, k can only go up to 8.

But hold on, is that all?

<prompt_3.2> Using the above plan, verify that the squares of multiples of 5 less than 2023 are indeed 1600 and 2025, and confirm the number of such squares. </prompt_3.2>

But wait, let me make sure there's no other way a perfect square less than 2023 could be divisible by 5. For example, could a square number divisible by 5 be something other than (5k)^2?

<prompt_3.3> Using the above plan, discuss whether other perfect squares divisible by 5 exist and confirm that all such squares are multiples of 25. </prompt_3.3>

Let's compute:

For k=1: (5*1)^2 = 25. 25 < 2023. Yes.
k=2: 10² = 100. 100 < 2023.
k=3: 15² = 225. 225 < 2023.
k=4: 20² = 400. 400 < 2023.
k=5: 25² = 625. 625 < 2023.
k=6: 30² = 900. 900 < 2023.
k=7: 35² = 1225. 1225 < 2023.
k=8: 40² = 1600. 1600 < 2023.
k=9: 45² = 2025. 2025 is greater than 2023, so we stop here.

Wait, but maybe there's another angle. The problem says "positive perfect squares less than 2023 divisible by 5". So, perhaps there are perfect squares divisible by 5 that are not necessarily multiples of 25? But no, because 5 is prime. If a square is divisible by 5, then 5 must divide the number, and since it's a square, 5^2 must divide the number. Therefore, the number must be a multiple of 25. Therefore, all such squares must be of the form (5k)^2. Therefore, my initial approach is correct.

Wait, but let me double-check. Suppose n² is divisible by 5. Then 5 divides n². Since 5 is prime, 5 divides n. Therefore, n is a multiple of 5, so n=5k for some integer k. Therefore, n²=25k². So, indeed, all perfect squares divisible by 5 must be multiples of 25. Therefore, the squares we need are exactly the multiples of 25 that are less than 2023. So, the number of such squares is the number of integers k such that 25k² < 2023. Which is k previous 1 floor, is 8.

<execution_3.3>
Let me think. Suppose a number n² is divisible by 5. Then, as we said before, 5 divides n, so n=5k, so n²=25k². Therefore, all perfect squares divisible by 5 must be multiples of 25. Therefore, all such squares are of the form 25k², where k is a positive integer. Therefore, the squares we're looking for are exactly those numbers. Therefore, the count is the number of k such that 25k² < 2023. Which is the same as k² < 2023/25 ≈ 80.92, so k ≤8. Therefore, 8 numbers. So, the answer is 8.

Based on execution_3.1, execution_3.2, execution_3.3:
But let me check with another approach. Let's list all perfect squares less than 2023 and count those divisible by 5. But that would be tedious, but maybe for a few numbers.

<prompt_4.1> Using the above plan, list all perfect squares less than 2023 and count how many are divisible by 5. </prompt_4.1>

Alternatively, maybe compute the largest integer m such that m² < 2023. Let's see. sqrt(2023) ≈ 44.98, so m=44. Therefore, the perfect squares less than 2023 are 1², 2², ...., 44². Now, among these, how many are divisible by 5? A square is divisible by 5 if and only if the number itself is divisible by 5, as we discussed. So, the numbers from 1 to 44 that are divisible by 5 are 5,10,15,....,40. Wait, 40 is 5*8, next would be 45, but 45 is 5*9, but 45²=2025 which is over 2023. So, the numbers are 5,10,....,40. So, how many terms is that? The numbers are 5*1, 5*2, ....,5*8. So, 8 numbers. Therefore, their squares are 25, 100, 225, ...., 1600. Which is exactly the same as before. Therefore, 8 perfect squares. Therefore, the answer is 8.

Wait, but let me check the squares of 5 to 40 in steps of 5. 5²=25, 10²=100, 15²=225, 20²=400, 25²=625, 30²=900, 35²=1225, 40²=1600. Then 45²=2025 which is over 2023. So, yes, exactly 8 numbers. Therefore, the answer is 8.
