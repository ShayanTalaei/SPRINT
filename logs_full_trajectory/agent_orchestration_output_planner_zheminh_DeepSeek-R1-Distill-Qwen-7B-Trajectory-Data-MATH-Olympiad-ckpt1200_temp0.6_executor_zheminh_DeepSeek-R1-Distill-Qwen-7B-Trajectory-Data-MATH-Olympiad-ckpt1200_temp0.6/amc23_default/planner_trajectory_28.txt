<Question>
For complex number $u = a+bi$ and $v = c+di$ (where $i=\sqrt{-1}$), define the binary operation
$u \otimes v = ac + bdi$
Suppose $z$ is a complex number such that $z\otimes z = z^{2}+40$. What is $|z|^2$?

Okay, let's see. I need to find |z|² where z is a complex number such that z⊗z = z² + 40. The operation ⊗ is defined as u⊗v = ac + bdi for complex numbers u = a + bi and v = c + di. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

<prompt_1.1> Understand the definition of the operation ⊗ and express u and v in terms of their real and imaginary parts. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
First, let me parse the definition of the operation ⊗. It says for u = a + bi and v = c + di, u⊗v is equal to ac + bdi. Wait, that seems a bit unusual. Normally, complex multiplication is (a + bi)(c + di) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i. But this operation is different. Let me write it out:

u⊗v = ac + bdi. So, the real part is ac, and the imaginary part is bd multiplied by i. So, if I have two complex numbers u and v, their ⊗ product has real part equal to the product of their real coefficients and imaginary part equal to the product of their imaginary coefficients times i. Interesting. So, unlike regular complex multiplication, here the real part is the product of the real parts, and the imaginary part is the product of the imaginary parts. Wait, let me confirm:

If u = a + bi and v = c + di, then u⊗v = ac + (bd)i. So, yes, real part is ac, imaginary part is bd. So, in other words, u⊗v = (a*c) + (b*d)i. Got it. So, this is a different multiplication operation. Not standard complex multiplication.

So, given that, we need to compute z⊗z where z is a complex number. Let's denote z = x + yi, where x and y are real numbers. Then, according to the definition, z⊗z would be (x*x) + (y*y)i. Wait, is that right?

But let me check with another approach. Let's suppose that z⊗z = z² + 40. Let's compute both sides using standard complex multiplication and see if we can relate them.


-----

Wait, but let me check with another example. Let's suppose z = 2 + 3i.



Another example: z = 0 + 0i. Then z⊗z = 0⊗0 = 0 + 0i. z² + 40 = 0 + 40 = 40. So 0 + 0i ≠ 40. So, z = 0 is not a solution. Another example: z = 1 + 0i. Then z⊗z = 1*1 + 0*0i = 1. z² + 40 = 1 + 40 = 41. 1 ≠ 41. So, not a solution. z = 0 + 1i. Then z⊗z = 0*0 + 1*1i = i. z² + 40 = (0 + 1i)² + 40 = (-1) + 40 = 39. So, i ≠ 39. So, not a solution.

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Alternatively, if we take z = a + bi, then z⊗z = a² + b²i. On the other hand, z² = (a + bi)² = a² - b² + 2abi. Then, z² + 40 = (a² - b² + 40) + 2abi. So, setting z⊗z equal to z² + 40:

<prompt_2.1> Set up the equation z⊗z = z² + 40 and separate real and imaginary parts to find equations involving a and b. </prompt_2.1>

Let's check if these values satisfy the equations. From equation 1: a² - b² = 40. From equation 2: 2ab = 0. If 2ab = 0, then either a = 0 or b = 0.

<prompt_2.2> Analyze the cases where a = 0 or b = 0 to find possible solutions. </prompt_2.2>

But let's check if these solutions satisfy the original equation z⊗z = z² + 40.

First, take z = 0 + 0i. Then z⊗z = 0*0 + 0*0i = 0. z² + 40 = (0 + 0i)² + 40 = 0 + 40 = 40.
0 ≠ 40, so this is not a solution. Similarly, z = 0 + 0i is invalid.

<prompt_2.3> Verify the solutions z = sqrt(40) and z = -sqrt(40) by checking if they satisfy z⊗z = z² + 40. </prompt_2.3>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
a² + b²i = (a² - b² + 40) + 2abi.

Therefore, equating the real and imaginary parts:

Real: a² = a² - b² + 40 ⇒ 0 = -b² + 40 ⇒ b² = 40.

Imaginary: b² = 2ab.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Case 1: a = 0. Then, from equation 1: 0 - b² = 40 ⇒ -b² = 40 ⇒ b² = -40. But b is a real number, so b² cannot be negative. Therefore, no solution in this case.

Case 2: b = 0. Then, from equation 1: a² - 0 = 40 ⇒ a² = 40 ⇒ a = ±√40. Then, |z|² = a² + b² = 40 + 0 = 40. So, this is a possible solution.
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
Wait, but maybe z = 0 + 0i is not allowed because z⊗z would be 0, but z² +40 is 40. So 0 ≠ 40. So, z = 0 is not a solution. So, even though a = 0 gives b² = 40, which would be z = 0 + sqrt(40)i or z = 0 - sqrt(40)i, but let's check if those work.

Take z = 0 + sqrt(40)i. Then z⊗z = 0*0 + (sqrt(40)*sqrt(40))i = 40i. z² +40 = (0 + sqrt(40)i)^2 +40 = (-40) + 40 = 0. So, 40i ≠ 0. Similarly, z = 0 - sqrt(40)i would also give z⊗z = 40i ≠ 0. So, those are not solutions either.

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Therefore, b² = 2ab.

So, we have two equations:

1. b² = 40

<prompt_3.1> Solve the system of equations for a and b to find the possible values. </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
2. b² = 2ab

From equation 2, since b² = 2ab, and from equation 1, b² = 40, then 40 = 2ab ⇒ 2ab = 40 ⇒ ab = 20.
</execution_3.1>
</Execution_3>

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
But from equation 1, b² = 40. So, b = ±√40. Therefore, substituting into ab = 20:

a = 20 / b = 20 / (±√40) = ±20 / √40 = ±20 / (2√10) = ±10 / √10 = ±√10.

Therefore, a = ±√10 and b = ±√40. Wait, but we need to check the signs here. Let's see.

<prompt_4.1> Determine the possible values of a and b considering the signs and verify if they satisfy the original equations. </prompt_4.1>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
From equation 2: ab = 20. If b is positive, then a must be positive, and if b is negative, a must be negative. So, the possible solutions are:

Case 1: b = √40, then a = 20 / √40 = √10 (since 20 / √40 = 20 / (2√10) = 10 / √10 = √10).

Case 2: b = -√40, then a = 20 / (-√40) = -√10.

So, the possible complex numbers z are:

z = √10 + √40 i

and

z = -√10 - √40 i

<Plan_5>
Based on execution_4.1:
Therefore, |z|² = a² + b² = ( (√10)^2 + (√40)^2 ) = 10 + 40 = 50.

Wait, but let me check if these values actually satisfy the original equation z⊗z = z² + 40.

Let's take z = √10 + √40 i.

<prompt_5.1> Verify that the complex numbers z = √10 + √40i and z = -√10 - √40i satisfy the equation z⊗z = z² + 40. </prompt_5.1>

Alternatively, if we compute |z|², which is a² + b². Since a² = 10 and b² = 40, then |z|² = 10 + 40 = 50.

Therefore, the answer is 50.

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
Compute z⊗z:

z⊗z = (√10)(√10) + (√40)(√40) i = 10 + 40i.

Compute z² + 40:

z² = (√10 + √40 i)^2 = (√10)^2 + 2*(√10)*(√40)i + (√40 i)^2 = 10 + 2*√400*i + 40 i² = 10 + 2*20*i + 40*(-1) = 10 + 40i - 40 = -30 + 40i.

Then, z² + 40 = (-30 + 40i) + 40 = 10 + 40i. Which matches z⊗z = 10 + 40i. So, that works.

Similarly, if we take z = -√10 - √40 i, then z⊗z = (-√10)(-√10) + (-√40)(-√40)i = 10 + 40i. Similarly, z² = (-√10 - √40 i)^2 = (-√10)^2 + 2*(-√10)*(-√40)i + (-√40 i)^2 = 10 + 2*√400 i + 40 i² = 10 + 40i - 40 = -30 + 40i. Then, z² + 40 = -30 + 40i + 40 = 10 + 40i. So, same result. So, both solutions satisfy the equation.

Therefore, |z|² is 10 + 40 = 50.
