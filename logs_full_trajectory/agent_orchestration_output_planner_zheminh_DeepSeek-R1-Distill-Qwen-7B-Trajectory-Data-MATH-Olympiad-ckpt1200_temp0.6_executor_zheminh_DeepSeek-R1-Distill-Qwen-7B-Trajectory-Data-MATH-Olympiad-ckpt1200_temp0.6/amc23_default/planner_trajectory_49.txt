Okay, so I need to find the area of the region defined by the inequality ||x| - 1| + ||y| - 1| ≤ 1. Hmm, this looks a bit complicated with all the absolute value signs. Let me try to break it down step by step.

<prompt_1.1> Analyze the given inequality ||x| - 1| + ||y| - 1| ≤ 1 and plan to break it down step-by-step to understand the region it defines. </prompt_1.1>

<execution_1.1>
First, I remember that absolute value equations often define regions that are symmetric in some way. Since there are absolute values around x and y, maybe the region is symmetric across both the x-axis and y-axis. That might simplify things because I can just analyze one quadrant and multiply the area by 4. Let me check if that's the case.

The inequality involves ||x| - 1| and ||y| - 1|. Let me consider what the expressions inside the absolute values look like. For example, |x| is the absolute value of x, which is symmetric about the y-axis. Then |x| - 1 would shift that graph down by 1 unit. Taking the absolute value of that result again, ||x| - 1|, would create another V-shape or maybe some other shape. Similarly, the same applies to y.

So maybe I can start by analyzing the equation in different regions based on the values of x and y. Since absolute value functions can change their behavior depending on whether the argument is positive or negative, I should consider different cases for x and y.

Let me start with x. The expression |x| can be written as x if x ≥ 0 and -x if x < 0. Similarly for y. But because of the symmetry, maybe I can just consider the first quadrant where x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0, find the area there, and then multiply by 4. Let me try that approach.

In the first quadrant, x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0. So |x| = x and |y| = y. Then the inequality becomes |x - 1| + |y - 1| ≤ 1. Wait, is that right? Let me check:

Original inequality: ||x| - 1| + ||y| - 1| ≤ 1

In the first quadrant, |x| = x, so ||x| - 1| becomes |x - 1|. Similarly, ||y| - 1| becomes |y - 1|.

So the inequality simplifies to |x - 1| + |y - 1| ≤ 1 in the first quadrant. That seems manageable. Now, I need to graph this in the first quadrant and find the area.

The equation |x - 1| + |y - 1| ≤ 1 is similar to the equation of a diamond or a square rotated by 45 degrees. The general form |x - a| + |y - b| ≤ c represents a diamond centered at (a, b) with vertices at a distance c along the axes. So in this case, it's a diamond centered at (1, 1) with vertices 1 unit away along the x and y axes. But since we're in the first quadrant, we need to consider how this diamond intersects with the first quadrant.

Wait, but actually, the center is at (1, 1), which is already in the first quadrant. So the diamond will extend from (1 - 1, 1) to (1 + 1, 1) in the x-direction, and similarly from (1, 1 - 1) to (1, 1 + 1) in the y-direction. So the diamond's vertices are at (0, 1), (2, 1), (1, 0), and (1, 2). But since we are in the first quadrant, all these points are valid. However, the original inequality is only in the first quadrant, so the diamond is entirely in the first quadrant?
Wait, no. Because the diamond is centered at (1,1), and its vertices are at (0,1), (2,1), (1,0), and (1,2). But in the first quadrant, x and y are both non-negative.

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
So the diamond in the first quadrant would have vertices at (0,1), (2,1), (1,2), and (1,0). But in the first quadrant, (1,0) is on the x-axis, and (0,1) is on the y-axis. Wait, but the diamond in the first quadrant would actually be bounded by these four points. However, the diamond is a square rotated 45 degrees. The area of such a diamond is 2 * c^2, where c is the distance from the center to the vertices along the axes. Wait, in this case, c is 1, so the area would be 2 * 1^2 = 2.

<prompt_2.1> Calculate the area of the diamond defined by |x - 1| + |y - 1| ≤ 1 in the first quadrant using the diamond area formula. </prompt_2.1>

But wait, let me verify that. Let me plot the diamond in the first quadrant. The equation |x - 1| + |y - 1| ≤ 1.

<prompt_2.2> Verify the area of the diamond defined by |x - 1| + |y - 1| ≤ 1 in the first quadrant by analyzing the shape and its vertices. </prompt_2.2>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
But let me check again. The standard formula for the area of a diamond defined by |x - a| + |y - b| ≤ c is 2c^2. So here, c is 1, so the area is 2*1^2 = 2. But since we are in the first quadrant, and the diamond is entirely within the first quadrant, right? Wait, no. The diamond is centered at (1,1), and its vertices are at (0,1), (2,1), (1,0), and (1,2). But in the first quadrant, (0,1) is on the boundary, (2,1) is also on the boundary, (1,0) is on the boundary, and (1,2) is also on the boundary. So in the first quadrant, the diamond is a square with vertices at those four points, forming a diamond shape. However, since we are in the first quadrant, the area is indeed 2. But wait, the diamond is entirely in the first quadrant? Wait, no. The diamond is centered at (1,1), and its vertices are at (0,1), (2,1), (1,0), and (1,2). So in the first quadrant, the diamond would be the entire diamond, but since we are restricted to x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0, the diamond is split by the axes. Wait, but the diamond is symmetric across both axes. So in the first quadrant, the diamond is a quarter of the entire diamond. Wait, no. Wait, the entire diamond is in all four quadrants, but since we are only considering x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0, the part of the diamond in the first quadrant is a quarter of the diamond. Wait, but the center is at (1,1), which is in the first quadrant, but the diamond extends into other quadrants as well.

Wait, maybe I need to visualize this more carefully. The equation |x - 1| + |y - 1| ≤ 1. Let's consider different cases for x and y.

Case 1: x ≥ 1 and y ≥ 1.

Then |x - 1| = x - 1 and |y - 1| = y - 1. So the inequality becomes (x - 1) + (y - 1) ≤ 1 ⇒ x + y - 2 ≤ 1 ⇒ x + y ≤ 3. But since x ≥ 1 and y ≥ 1, the line x + y = 3 intersects the first quadrant at (3,0) and (0,3), but in this case, x and y are both ≥ 1, so the intersection points would be (2,1) and (1,2). Wait, but that seems inconsistent. Wait, if x ≥ 1 and y ≥ 1, then x + y ≤ 3. So in this region, the inequality is x + y ≤ 3. But the diamond's equation in this region is x + y ≤ 3, but the diamond is supposed to have vertices at (2,1) and (1,2). Wait, maybe I need to check this.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to sketch the graph. Let's consider the equation |x - 1| + |y - 1| ≤ 1.

The graph is a diamond centered at (1,1) with vertices 1 unit away along the x and y axes. So the vertices are at (1 + 1, 1) = (2,1), (1 - 1,1) = (0,1), (1,1 + 1) = (1,2), and (1,1 - 1) = (1,0). So in the first quadrant, the diamond has vertices at (0,1), (2,1), (1,2), and (1,0). But (1,0) is on the x-axis, which is part of the first quadrant boundary. Similarly, (0,1) is on the y-axis. So in the first quadrant, the diamond is bounded by these four points. So the shape is a square rotated 45 degrees, with its center at (1,1), and vertices at those four points. The area of this diamond is 2, as per the formula.

But wait, if the diamond is centered at (1,1) and has vertices 1 unit away, then the distance between the center and each vertex is 1. The area of a diamond (which is a rhombus) is (d1 * d2)/2, where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals. In this case, the diagonals are 2 units each: one diagonal is from (0,1) to (2,1), which is 2 units long, and the other diagonal is from (1,0) to (1,2), which is also 2 units long. Therefore, the area is (2 * 2)/2 = 2. So that's correct.

Therefore, in the first quadrant, the area defined by the inequality is 2. Since the original inequality is symmetric across both axes, the total area would be 4 times that, right? Wait, no. Wait, the original inequality is ||x| - 1| + ||y| - 1| ≤ 1. Because of the absolute values, the equation is symmetric with respect to both x and y axes. So whatever shape we get in the first quadrant is mirrored in all four quadrants. Therefore, if the area in the first quadrant is 2, then the total area is 4 * 2 = 8.

<execution_2.2>
Let's break down the equation into different regions based on the signs of (x - 1) and (y - 1).

Case 1: x - 1 ≥ 0 and y - 1 ≥ 0 (i.e., x ≥ 1 and y ≥ 1). Then the equation becomes (x - 1) + (y - 1) ≤ 1, which simplifies to x + y ≤ 3. But since x ≥ 1 and y ≥ 1, the line x + y = 3 intersects the region x ≥ 1, y ≥ 1. The intersection points would be at (1, 2) and (2, 1). So in this case, the region is a triangle with vertices at (1, 1), (1, 2), and (2, 1).

Case 2: x - 1 ≥ 0 and y - 1 ≤ 0 (i.e., x ≥ 1 and y ≤ 1). Then the equation becomes (x - 1) + (1 - y) ≤ 1, which simplifies to x - y ≤ 1. But since x ≥ 1 and y ≤ 1, let's see where this line intersects. At y = 1, x ≤ 2. At x = 1, 1 - y ≤ 1 ⇒ y ≥ 0. So the line x - y = 1 intersects the region x ≥ 1, y ≤ 1 at (1, 0) and (2, 1). But since y ≤ 1, the region here is a quadrilateral? Wait, maybe a triangle. Wait, when x ≥ 1 and y ≤ 1, the inequality x - y ≤ 1. The line x - y = 1 intersects the x-axis at (1, 0) and the line x = 2 at (2, 1). So the region is bounded by x = 1, y = 1, and x - y = 1. So the vertices are (1, 0), (1, 1), and (2, 1). But wait, (2,1) is already part of the previous case. Hmm, maybe overlapping.

Case 3: x - 1 ≤ 0 and y - 1 ≥ 0 (i.e., x ≤ 1 and y ≥ 1). Then the equation becomes (1 - x) + (y - 1) ≤ 1, which simplifies to y - x ≤ 1. Since x ≤ 1 and y ≥ 1, the line y - x = 1 intersects at y = 1 when x = 0, and at x = 1, y = 2. So the region here is bounded by x = 1, y = 1, and y - x = 1. The vertices would be (0, 1), (1, 1), and (1, 2).

Case 4: x - 1 ≤ 0 and y - 1 ≤ 0 (i.e., x ≤ 1 and y ≤ 1). Then the equation becomes (1 - x) + (1 - y) ≤ 1, which simplifies to 2 - x - y ≤ 1 ⇒ x + y ≥ 1. So the region here is above the line x + y = 1, within x ≤ 1 and y ≤ 1. The vertices of this region would be at (1, 0), (0, 1), and (1, 1).

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe instead of breaking into cases, I can sketch the graph.

The equation |x - 1| + |y - 1| ≤ 1 is a diamond (a square rotated by 45 degrees) centered at (1, 1) with vertices 1 unit away in each direction. So the vertices are at (1 + 1, 1) = (2, 1), (1 - 1, 1) = (0, 1), (1, 1 + 1) = (1, 2), and (1, 1 - 1) = (1, 0). So in the first quadrant, the diamond has vertices at (0,1), (2,1), (1,2), and (1,0). But since we are in the first quadrant, all these points are valid. However, the diamond crosses into negative x and y, but since we are considering the first quadrant, we need to see how much of the diamond lies in the first quadrant.

Wait, actually, the diamond is entirely in the first quadrant because all its vertices are in the first quadrant. Wait, no. The diamond is centered at (1,1), so the points (0,1) and (1,0) are on the axes, but the other vertices (2,1) and (1,2) are also in the first quadrant. So actually, the entire diamond is in the first quadrant. Wait, but if you plot the lines connecting these vertices, the diamond would extend from (0,1) to (2,1) along the x-axis, and from (1,0) to (1,2) along the y-axis. The diamond would be a square with sides of length √2, right? Because the distance between (0,1) and (1,2) is √[(1-0)^2 + (2-1)^2] = √2. Similarly for other sides.

But the area of a diamond (which is a rhombus) is (d1 * d2)/2, where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals. In this case, the diagonals are along the x and y axes. The horizontal diagonal is from (0,1) to (2,1), which is 2 units long. The vertical diagonal is from (1,0) to (1,2), which is 2 units long. So the area would be (2 * 2)/2 = 2. So the area in the first quadrant is 2.

Based on execution_2.1:
Therefore, the total area would be 4 * 2 = 8.
But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me verify.

Wait, but actually, the original inequality is ||x| - 1| + ||y| - 1| ≤ 1. So even though we considered the first quadrant, the original equation isn't just |x - 1| + |y - 1| ≤ 1 in the first quadrant; it's the same in all quadrants because of the absolute values. Wait, no. Let me check.

Original inequality: ||x| - 1| + ||y| - 1| ≤ 1.

<prompt_3.1> Verify the total area by considering the symmetry of the original inequality and the regions covered by the diamond in each quadrant. </prompt_3.1>

But wait, let me check with specific points. For example, take the point (0,0).

<prompt_3.2> Verify the solution by checking if specific points satisfy the original inequality and conclude the final area. </prompt_3.2>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
If we take a point in another quadrant, say (-x, y), then ||-x| -1| + ||y| -1| = ||x| -1| + ||y| -1|, which is the same as in the first quadrant. So yes, the equation is symmetric across both axes. Therefore, the region defined by the inequality is symmetric in all four quadrants. So if in the first quadrant the area is 2, then total area is 4 * 2 = 8.

Wait, but let me check another point. For example, take (2, 2). Then ||2| -1| + ||2| -1| = |2 -1| + |2 -1| = 1 + 1 = 2, which is greater than 1, so (2,2) is not in the region. So the diamond doesn't extend beyond (2,1), (1,2), etc. So in the first quadrant, the diamond is bounded by those four points, and the area is 2. Then total area is 4 * 2 = 8.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
Then | |0| -1 | = |0 -1| = 1, and similarly for y. So ||x| -1| + ||y| -1| = 1 + 1 = 2, which is greater than 1. So (0,0) is not in the region. Now take (1,1). Then ||1| -1| + ||1| -1| = 0 + 0 = 0 ≤ 1, so (1,1) is in the region. Take (2,1). Then ||2| -1| + ||1| -1| = |2 -1| + |1 -1| = 1 + 0 = 1 ≤ 1, so (2,1) is on the boundary. Similarly, (1,2), (0,1), and (1,0) are on the boundary. So the diamond is centered at (1,1) with vertices at (0,1), (2,1), (1,2), (1,0). So in the entire coordinate plane, this diamond is a square rotated 45 degrees with those vertices. The area is 2, as calculated before. But wait, the original inequality is ||x| -1| + ||y| -1| ≤1. Let me check another point, say (2,2). Then ||2| -1| + ||2| -1| = |2 -1| + |2 -1| = 1 + 1 = 2 >1, so (2,2) is outside the region. Similarly, (0,2): ||0| -1| + ||2| -1| = 1 + 1 = 2 >1. So the diamond is indeed bounded by these four points. Therefore, the area is 2 in the entire plane.

Wait, but that contradicts my earlier thought about multiplying by 4. Wait, no. Wait, the diamond is already in the entire plane. The original inequality is symmetric across both axes, so the diamond is centered at (1,1) but the equation is ||x| -1| + ||y| -1| ≤1. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the diamond is centered at (1,1). Let me check again.

Wait, the original inequality is ||x| -1| + ||y| -1| ≤1. Let's consider that for any x, |x| is non-negative. So |x| -1 can be negative or positive. But then taking the absolute value again, ||x| -1| is always non-negative. So the inequality is the sum of two non-negative terms being ≤1. So the region is bounded by the equation ||x| -1| + ||y| -1| =1. Let me try to graph this.

Alternatively, perhaps I can perform a substitution. Let u = |x| and v = |y|. Then the inequality becomes |u -1| + |v -1| ≤1, where u ≥0 and v ≥0. So this reduces the problem to the first quadrant in the u-v plane. The equation |u -1| + |v -1| ≤1 is a diamond in the u-v plane with center at (1,1) and vertices at (0,1), (2,1), (1,0), and (1,2). So the area in the u-v plane is 2. But since u = |x| and v = |y|, each (u,v) corresponds to four points in the x-y plane (except when u=0 or v=0). Therefore, the area in the x-y plane would be 4 times the area in the u-v plane. Wait, is that correct?
</execution_3.2>
</Execution_3>

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.2:
Because for each point (u,v) in the u-v plane, there are four points in the x-y plane: (x,y) = (±u, ±v). So the Jacobian determinant for the transformation from (x,y) to (u,v) is 4, since each (x,y) maps to (u,v) where u and v are non-negative. Therefore, the area in the x-y plane would be 4 times the area in the u-v plane. But the area in the u-v plane is 2, so total area is 4 * 2 = 8.

Wait, but let me verify this transformation approach.

<prompt_4.1> Verify the area calculation using the Jacobian determinant method and confirm the final area. </prompt_4.1>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
The substitution u = |x|, v = |y| maps the entire plane to the first quadrant in the u-v plane. For each (u,v) in the first quadrant, there are four corresponding points in the x-y plane: (u,v), (-u,v), (u,-v), (-u,-v). However, the Jacobian determinant for this transformation is 4, as each quadrant in the x-y plane corresponds to one in the u-v plane. Therefore, the area in the x-y plane is 4 times the area in the u-v plane. Since the area in the u-v plane is 2, the total area in the x-y plane is 4 * 2 = 8. Therefore, the area is 8.

But wait, this contradicts my earlier thought that the diamond is already in the entire plane. Wait, no. The substitution u = |x|, v = |y| reduces the problem to the first quadrant in u-v, but the original inequality is symmetric across all quadrants. Therefore, the area in the x-y plane is indeed 4 times the area in the u-v plane. Therefore, the total area is 8.

But let me check with a concrete example. Let's consider the point (2,1) in the x-y plane. Then u = |2| = 2, v = |1| = 1. The equation |2 -1| + |1 -1| = 1 + 0 = 1 ≤1, so (2,1) is included. Similarly, (-2,1) would map to u=2, v=1, same as (2,1). Therefore, each point in the u-v plane corresponds to four points in the x-y plane, except when u=0 or v=0, which correspond to two or one points. However, since the area in the u-v plane is 2, multiplying by 4 gives the total area in the x-y plane as 8. Therefore, the answer should be 8.

Wait, but let me confirm once more. Let's consider the region defined by ||x| -1| + ||y| -1| ≤1. Let's substitute x = 0. Then the equation becomes ||0| -1| + ||y| -1| = 1 + ||y| -1| ≤1. Therefore, ||y| -1| ≤0, which implies |y| -1 =0 ⇒ |y|=1 ⇒ y=±1. So the points (0,1) and (0,-1) are on the boundary. Similarly, when y=0, the points (1,0) and (-1,0) are on the boundary. So the diamond touches these points. Similarly, when x=2, y=1, etc. So the diamond is indeed as I described. But the key point is that the substitution u=|x|, v=|y| reduces the problem to the first quadrant in u-v, and the area is 4 times larger in x-y. Therefore, the total area is 8.

<execution_5.1>
Let me consider the equation ||x| -1| + ||y| -1| ≤1. Let's set u = |x| and v = |y|. Then the equation becomes |u -1| + |v -1| ≤1. The region in the u-v plane is the same as before: a diamond with area 2. Since each (u,v) corresponds to four points in the x-y plane (except when u=0 or v=0), the total area is 4 * 2 = 8.

<Plan_6>
Based on execution_5.1:
Therefore, the area of the region defined by the inequality is 8.

But wait, let me check with another approach. Let's consider the equation ||x| -1| + ||y| -1| ≤1. Let's denote a = |x| and b = |y|. Then the equation becomes |a -1| + |b -1| ≤1. The region in the a-b plane is the diamond with vertices at (0,1), (2,1), (1,0), (1,2). The area is 2. Since a = |x| and b = |y|, the transformation from (x,y) to (a,b) is 4-to-1 except on the axes. Therefore, the area in the x-y plane is 4 times the area in the a-b plane. Therefore, 4*2=8.

Alternatively, if I consider that the original equation is symmetric in x and y, and also symmetric in positive and negative values. So the area in each quadrant is the same, and since the diamond in the a-b plane has area 2, then multiplying by 4 gives 8.

Therefore, after multiple approaches and checks, the area of the region defined by ||x| -1| + ||y| -1| ≤1 is 8.
