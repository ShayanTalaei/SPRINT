Okay, so I need to find the positive difference between the x-coordinates of points A and B, which lie on the graph of y = log₂x. The midpoint of segment AB is given as (6, 2). The answer needs to be in the form m√n, where m and n are relatively prime positive integers, and then find m + n. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

<execution_1.1>
First, let's recall that if two points A and B have coordinates (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂), their midpoint M is given by the average of their coordinates: M = ((x₁ + x₂)/2, (y₁ + y₂)/2). So here, the midpoint is (6, 2), which means:

(x₁ + x₂)/2 = 6 and (y₁ + y₂)/2 = 2.

Therefore, x₁ + x₂ = 12 and y₁ + y₂ = 4.

Since points A and B are on the graph of y = log₂x, their coordinates must satisfy this equation. So, for point A, y₁ = log₂x₁, and for point B, y₂ = log₂x₂. Therefore, we can write:

log₂x₁ + log₂x₂ = 4.

Using logarithm properties, log₂(x₁x₂) = 4, which implies that x₁x₂ = 2⁴ = 16.

Based on execution_1.1:
Now, we have two equations:

1. x₁ + x₂ = 12
2. x₁x₂ = 16

This is a system of equations that can be solved by recognizing it as a quadratic equation. Let's let x₁ and x₂ be the roots of the quadratic equation t² - (x₁ + x₂)t + x₁x₂ = 0.

Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem using the properties of logarithms and midpoints. Let me think.

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Plugging in the known values:

t² - 12t + 16 = 0.

Let's solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula: t = [12 ± √(144 - 64)] / 2 = [12 ± √80]/2.

Simplify √80: √80 = √(16*5) = 4√5. Therefore, t = [12 ± 4√5]/2 = 6 ± 2√5.

So the solutions are t = 6 + 2√5 and t = 6 - 2√5. Therefore, the x-coordinates of points A and B are 6 + 2√5 and 6 - 2√5.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Since the midpoint is (6, 2), the average of the x-coordinates is 6, so x₁ + x₂ = 12. The average of the y-coordinates is 2, so y₁ + y₂ = 4. But y₁ = log₂x₁ and y₂ = log₂x₂, so log₂x₁ + log₂x₂ = 4. Which again gives log₂(x₁x₂) = 4, so x₁x₂ = 16. So same result as before. Therefore, the quadratic equation is t² -12t +16 = 0. Solving this quadratic gives t = [12 ± sqrt(144 -64)]/2 = [12 ± sqrt(80)]/2 = [12 ± 4*sqrt(5)]/2 = 6 ± 2*sqrt(5). Therefore, x₁ and x₂ are 6 + 2√5 and 6 - 2√5. The difference between them is 4√5, so the positive difference is 4√5. So m = 4, n = 5, m + n = 9.

Now, the problem asks for the positive difference between the x-coordinates of A and B. So that would be |x₁ - x₂|.

Therefore, the answer is 9. Wait, but let me just check once more to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations.

<prompt_3.2> Perform a final verification of the solution to ensure no mistakes were made. </prompt_3.2>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
Let's compute this:

|x₁ - x₂| = |(6 + 2√5) - (6 - 2√5)| = |6 + 2√5 - 6 + 2√5| = |4√5| = 4√5.

So the positive difference is 4√5. Then, m = 4 and n = 5. Since 4 and 5 are coprime, m + n = 4 + 5 = 9.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
Let's check the quadratic equation again. If x₁ + x₂ = 12 and x₁x₂ =16, then the quadratic is t² -12t +16=0. The discriminant is 144 -64=80, so sqrt(80)=4√5. Then solutions are (12 ±4√5)/2=6 ±2√5. The difference is 4√5. So the positive difference is 4√5. So m=4, n=5, so 4+5=9.

First, the midpoint formula: correct. Then, converting the midpoint coordinates into sums: 6*2=12 for x, 2*2=4 for y. Then, since y = log₂x, so sum of logs is log of product: correct. So log₂(x₁x₂)=4 implies x₁x₂=16. Then quadratic equation with sum 12 and product 16: correct. Solving quadratic: discriminant 144 - 64 = 80, sqrt(80)=4√5, so roots are (12 ±4√5)/2=6 ±2√5. Then difference is 4√5. All steps check out.
