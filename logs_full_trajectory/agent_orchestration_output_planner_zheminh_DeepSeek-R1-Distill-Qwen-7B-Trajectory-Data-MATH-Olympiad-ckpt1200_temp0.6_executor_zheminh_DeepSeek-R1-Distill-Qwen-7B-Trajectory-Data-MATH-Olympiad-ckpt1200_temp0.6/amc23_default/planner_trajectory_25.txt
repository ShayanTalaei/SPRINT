<Question>
Mrs. Jones is pouring orange juice into four identical glasses for her four sons. She fills the first three glasses completely but runs out of juice when the fourth glass is only $\frac{1}{3}$ full. What fraction of a glass must Mrs. Jones pour from each of the first three glasses into the fourth glass so that all four glasses will have the same amount of juice? The final answer can be written in the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

Okay, so Mrs. Jones has four identical glasses and she's trying to pour orange juice for her four sons. The first three glasses are completely full, and the fourth one is only 1/3 full. She wants to redistribute the juice so that all four glasses have the same amount. The question is asking what fraction of a glass she needs to pour from each of the first three glasses into the fourth one. The answer should be a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then we need to find m + n.

Alright, let's start by understanding the problem. There are four glasses. Let's call them Glass 1, Glass 2, Glass 3, and Glass 4. Initially, Glasses 1, 2, and 3 are full, so each has 1 glass of juice. Glass 4 is only 1/3 full. So the total amount of juice Mrs. Jones has is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1/3 = 3 + 1/3 = 10/3 glasses of juice.

Since she wants to distribute this equally among the four glasses, each glass should have (10/3) divided by 4 = (10/3)*(1/4) = 10/12 = 5/6 of a glass. So each glass needs to end up with 5/6 of a glass.

<prompt_1.1> Calculate the total amount of juice and determine the amount each glass should have after redistribution. </prompt_1.1>

<execution_1.1>
Right now, Glasses 1, 2, and 3 each have 1 glass, and Glass 4 has 1/3. So we need to take some amount from each of the first three glasses and pour it into Glass 4 until all four are at 5/6.

Let me visualize this. Let's denote the amount poured from each of the first three glasses as x. So each of Glasses 1, 2, and 3 will lose x amount, and Glass 4 will gain 3x (since x is taken from each of the three). Then, after pouring, each of the first three glasses should have 1 - x, and Glass 4 should have 1/3 + 3x. We want all four to be equal to 5/6.

So setting up the equations:

For the first three glasses: 1 - x = 5/6

For the fourth glass: 1/3 + 3x = 5/6

Let me solve the first equation first. 1 - x = 5/6. Subtract 5/6 from both sides: 1 - 5/6 = x. 1 is 6/6, so 6/6 - 5/6 = 1/6. Therefore, x = 1/6.

Based on execution_1.1:
Wait, let me check if this is consistent with the fourth glass.

<prompt_2.1> Verify the solution by checking if the amount poured from the first three glasses into the fourth glass is consistent. </prompt_2.1>

But let me verify this another way to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Alternatively, let's compute the total amount of juice needed to pour into Glass 4.

<prompt_2.2> Verify the solution by computing the amount of juice poured into the fourth glass. </prompt_2.2>

Alternatively, let's think about the total amount poured out from the first three glasses.

<prompt_2.3> Verify the solution by considering the total amount poured out from the first three glasses. </prompt_2.3>

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this problem. Let's consider that each glass should have 5/6.

<prompt_2.4> Consider an alternative method to verify the solution. </prompt_2.4>

Based on execution_1.1, execution_2.1, execution_2.2, execution_2.3, execution_2.4:
Wait, but let me just make sure there isn't a different interpretation of the problem. The question says "fraction of a glass must Mrs. Jones pour from each of the first three glasses into the fourth glass". So we need to find x such that each of the first three glasses gives x, so x is the fraction of a glass poured from each.

<prompt_2.5> Re-evaluate the problem to ensure there is no alternative interpretation. </prompt_2.5>

Based on execution_1.1, execution_2.1, execution_2.2, execution_2.3, execution_2.4, execution_2.5:
Hmm, but wait a second. Let me check once again with another approach. Let's compute how much each glass needs to give up.

<prompt_2.6> Perform a final verification of the solution using another approach. </prompt_2.6>

Based on execution_1.1, execution_2.1, execution_2.2, execution_2.3, execution_2.4, execution_2.5, execution_2.6:
Therefore, the answer should be 1/6, so m = 1, n =6, m +n=7.

<prompt_2.7> Conclude the solution and verify the final answer. </prompt_2.7>

If we pour 3x into Glass 4, then 1/3 + 3x should equal 5/6. Let's plug in x = 1/6: 1/3 + 3*(1/6) = 1/3 + 1/2. Converting to sixths: 2/6 + 3/6 = 5/6. That works. So both equations give x = 1/6.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
The fourth glass currently has 1/3. It needs to get up to 5/6. So the amount needed is 5/6 - 1/3 = 5/6 - 2/6 = 3/6 = 1/2. So Glass 4 needs 1/2 more. But this 1/2 has to come from the first three glasses. Since each of the first three glasses is giving x, the total poured into Glass 4 is 3x. Therefore, 3x = 1/2. Solving for x, x = 1/2 รท 3 = 1/6.
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
The fourth glass needs to go from 1/3 to 5/6. So the amount needed is 5/6 - 1/3 = 5/6 - 2/6 = 3/6 = 1/2. So Glass 4 needs an additional 1/2 glass. But this 1/2 must come entirely from the first three glasses. Since she's pouring from each of the first three glasses, the total poured into Glass 4 is 3x. So 3x = 1/2. Therefore, x = 1/2 divided by 3 = 1/6. So that's the same result as before. So x is 1/6.
</execution_2.3>

<execution_2.4>
Glass 4 currently has 1/3. It needs to reach 5/6. So the amount needed to pour into Glass 4 is 5/6 - 1/3. Let's compute that. 5/6 - 2/6 = 3/6 = 1/2. So Glass 4 needs an additional 1/2 of a glass.

Therefore, the total amount poured from the first three glasses must be 1/2. Since there are three glasses, each contributing equally, each must pour 1/2 divided by 3, which is (1/2)*(1/3) = 1/6. So each of the first three glasses pours 1/6 into the fourth. That matches the previous result.
</execution_2.4>

<execution_2.5>
So each of the first three glasses gives x, so x is the fraction of a glass. Since each glass is being poured into the fourth, the total poured into the fourth is 3x, and the fourth glass needs to go from 1/3 to 5/6, so the amount needed is 5/6 - 1/3 = 5/6 - 2/6 = 3/6 = 1/2. Therefore, 3x = 1/2, so x = 1/6.
</execution_2.5>

<execution_2.6>
Each of the first three glasses needs to go from 1 to 5/6, so each needs to give up 1 - 5/6 = 1/6. So x = 1/6. Then the fourth glass needs to go from 1/3 to 5/6, so it needs 5/6 - 1/3 = 5/6 - 2/6 = 3/6 = 1/2. So the total amount poured into the fourth glass is 3x = 3*(1/6) = 1/2, which matches the required increase. Therefore, this checks out.

Another way to think about it: The total deficit in the first three glasses is each 1 - 5/6 = 1/6, so total deficit is 3*(1/6) = 1/2. The total surplus in the fourth glass is 5/6 - 1/3 = 1/2. So the amount poured from each of the three glasses is (1/2) divided by 3, which is 1/6. So that's another way to see it. So the answer is 1/6.

Therefore, the fraction is 1/6, so m + n = 1 + 6 = 7.
</execution_2.6>

<execution_2.7>
Yes, that seems correct.

Alternatively, let's think about how much each of the first three glasses needs to give. Each of them needs to go from 1 to 5/6, so they each need to give away 1 - 5/6 = 1/6. Then, the fourth glass needs to go from 1/3 to 5/6, so it needs 5/6 - 1/3 = 5/6 - 2/6 = 3/6 = 1/2. Therefore, the total amount poured into the fourth glass is 1/2, which is the sum of the amounts poured from each of the first three glasses. So if each of the first three pours x, then 3x = 1/2, so x = 1/6. Therefore, that confirms the same result.

So both methods give x = 1/6. Therefore, the fraction is 1/6, so m + n is 1 + 6 = 7.
