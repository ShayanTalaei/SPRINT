Okay, so I need to figure out for how many integer values of n the given expression is a real number. The expression is the square root of [ (log(n²) - (log n)²) divided by (log n - 3) ]. Let me break this down step by step.

First, since it's a square root, the expression inside the square root (the radicand) must be non-negative. Also, the denominator can't be zero because division by zero is undefined. So, there are two main conditions here:

1. The denominator (log n - 3) ≠ 0, which means log n ≠ 3 ⇒ n ≠ 10³ = 1000.
2. The entire expression inside the square root must be ≥ 0.

Let me handle the first condition first. So n cannot be 1000. But n is an integer, so we just have to make sure that n is not 1000. But let's check the second condition now because that might impose more restrictions.

Let me start by simplifying the numerator inside the square root. The numerator is log(n²) - (log n)².

<prompt_1.1> Simplify the numerator of the given expression. </prompt_1.1>

Now, the denominator is log n - 3. So the entire expression inside the square root is [2 log n - (log n)²] / (log n - 3). Let's denote log n as x for simplicity. Then the expression becomes [2x - x²]/(x - 3).

So, we need [2x - x²]/(x - 3) ≥ 0. Let's solve this inequality.

First, factor the numerator: 2x - x² = -x² + 2x = -x(x - 2). So the expression becomes [-x(x - 2)]/(x - 3) ≥ 0.

Let me rewrite this as [ -x(x - 2) ] / (x - 3) ≥ 0.
This can be written as [ -x(x - 2) ] / (x - 3) ≥ 0. Let's factor out the negative sign: - [x(x - 2)] / (x - 3) ≥ 0 ⇒ [x(x - 2)] / (x - 3) ≤ 0.

So the inequality simplifies to [x(x - 2)] / (x - 3) ≤ 0.

Now, let's find the critical points where the expression is zero or undefined. The numerator is zero when x = 0 or x = 2. The denominator is zero when x = 3, which is excluded because the original denominator log n - 3 ≠ 0 ⇒ x ≠ 3.

So, critical points at x = 0, x = 2, x = 3. These divide the real line into intervals:

1. (-∞, 0)
2. (0, 2)
3. (2, 3)
4. (3, ∞)

We need to test each interval to see where the expression [x(x - 2)] / (x - 3) is ≤ 0.

Let's start with interval 1: (-∞, 0). Let's pick x = -1.

<prompt_1.2> Test the interval (-∞, 0) to determine the sign of the expression. </prompt_1.2>

Interval 2: (0, 2). Let's pick x = 1.

<prompt_1.3> Test the interval (0, 2) to determine the sign of the expression. </prompt_1.3>

Interval 3: (2, 3). Let's pick x = 2.5.

<prompt_1.4> Test the interval (2, 3) to determine the sign of the expression. </prompt_1.4>

Interval 4: (3, ∞). Let's pick x = 4.

<prompt_1.5> Test the interval (3, ∞) to determine the sign of the expression. </prompt_1.5>

<execution_1.1>
Wait, log(n²) is equal to 2 log n because log(a^b) = b log a. So log(n²) = 2 log n. Therefore, the numerator becomes 2 log n - (log n)^2. So the entire expression inside the square root is [2 log n - (log n)^2] divided by (log n - 3). Let's denote log n as x for simplicity. Then the expression becomes [2x - x²]/(x - 3).
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
Plugging into [x(x - 2)] / (x - 3): (-1)(-1 - 2)/(-1 - 3) = (-1)(-3)/(-4) = 3/-4 = -0.75. So negative. Since we're looking for ≤ 0, this interval is part of the solution.
</execution_1.2>

<execution_1.3>
[2*(-1) - (-1)^2] / (-1 - 3) = [ -2 - 1 ] / (-4) = (-3)/(-4) = 3/4 > 0. So positive here.

Wait, but according to the inequality, we need the expression ≤ 0. So this interval is positive, which doesn't satisfy the inequality.
</execution_1.3>

<execution_1.4>
At x = 2.5, numerator: 2.5*(2.5 - 2) = 2.5*0.5 = 1.25. Denominator: 2.5 - 3 = -0.5. So the expression is 1.25 / (-0.5) = -2.5, which is negative. So in this interval, the expression is negative.
</execution_1.4>

<execution_1.5>
Let's compute the expression [x(x - 2)] / (x - 3) for each test point.

For x = -1:
Numerator: (-1)(-1 - 2) = (-1)(-3) = 3
Denominator: (-1 - 3) = -4
So 3 / (-4) = -0.75 < 0. So this interval satisfies the inequality.

For x = 1:
Numerator: (1)(1 - 2) = (1)(-1) = -1
Denominator: (1 - 3) = -2
So (-1)/(-2) = 0.5 > 0. Doesn't satisfy the inequality.

For x = 2.5:
Numerator: (2.5)(2.5 - 2) = (2.5)(0.5) = 1.25
Denominator: (2.5 - 3) = -0.5
So 1.25 / (-0.5) = -2.5 < 0. Satisfies the inequality.

For x = 4:
Numerator: (4)(4 - 2) = 4*2 = 8
Denominator: (4 - 3) = 1
So 8 / 1 = 8 > 0. Doesn't satisfy the inequality.

So the expression is ≤ 0 in intervals (-∞, 0] and (2, 3). But we have to check the critical points:

At x = 0: numerator is 0, so the expression is 0. So it's included.

At x = 2: numerator is 0, so expression is 0. Included.

At x = 3: undefined, so excluded.

Therefore, the solution for the inequality [x(x - 2)] / (x - 3) ≤ 0 is x ∈ (-∞, 0] ∪ [2, 3).

But remember that x = log n. So, we have:

log n ∈ (-∞, 0] ∪ [2, 3)

But log n is defined only when n > 0. Since n is an integer, n must be a positive integer (natural number). So n ≥ 1.

So, translating log n ∈ (-∞, 0] ∪ [2, 3) into n:

For log n ≤ 0 ⇒ n ≤ 10^0 = 1. But n is a positive integer, so n = 1.

For log n ∈ [2, 3) ⇒ 10^2 ≤ n < 10^3 ⇒ 100 ≤ n < 1000. Since n is an integer, n = 100, 101, ...., 999.

But we also have to remember that n ≠ 1000, but since n < 1000 in the second interval, that's already covered.

So combining both intervals:

n = 1 or n = 100, 101, ...., 999.

Now, let's count the number of integers in these ranges.

First interval: n = 1. That's 1 integer.

Second interval: from 100 to 999 inclusive. The number of integers here is 999 - 100 + 1 = 900.

So total integers n = 1 + 900 = 901.

But wait, hold on. Let me verify if all these n satisfy the original expression being real. Remember that the denominator log n - 3 must not be zero, but in the second interval, log n is less than 3, so log n - 3 is negative, but the numerator in the original expression is [2 log n - (log n)^2], which we transformed into [x(x - 2)] where x = log n. Wait, let me verify.

Wait, the original expression is sqrt( [2 log n - (log n)^2 ] / (log n - 3) ). After substitution x = log n, we had [2x - x²]/(x - 3) ≥ 0. Then we simplified it to [x(x - 2)]/(x - 3) ≤ 0. So in the second interval, x ∈ [2, 3), so log n ∈ [2, 3). Then the expression [x(x - 2)]/(x - 3) is ≤ 0, which means the numerator and denominator have opposite signs or zero. Let's check at x = 2: numerator is 2*0 = 0, denominator is -1, so 0/-1 = 0, which is allowed. At x approaching 3 from the left, denominator approaches 0 from the negative side, numerator approaches 2*1 = 2, so the expression approaches -infty, which is negative. So in [2, 3), the expression is negative or zero, which satisfies the inequality. Therefore, all these n are valid.

But wait, let me check n=1. When n=1, log n = 0. Then the original expression inside the square root is [2*0 - 0²]/(0 - 3) = 0 / (-3) = 0. So sqrt(0) is 0, which is real. So n=1 is valid.

Similarly, n=100: log n = 2. Then numerator is 2*2 - 2² = 4 - 4 = 0. Denominator is 2 - 3 = -1. So 0 / (-1) = 0. sqrt(0) is 0. Valid.

But wait, what about n=1000? log n = 3, but n=1000 is excluded because denominator becomes 0. So that's correct.

Therefore, the total number of integers n is 901.

Based on execution_1.2, execution_1.3, execution_1.4, execution_1.5:
Let me verify with a specific example. Take n=100.

<prompt_2.1> Verify the solution by testing specific values of n. </prompt_2.1>

But let me check another value in the second interval, say n=500. log 500 ≈ 2.69897.

<prompt_2.2> Verify the solution by testing specific values of n. </prompt_2.2>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
log 100 = 2. Then the expression inside sqrt is [2*2 - 2²]/(2 - 3) = (4 - 4)/(-1) = 0/-1 = 0. sqrt(0) is 0, which is real. So n=100 is okay.

What about n=999? log 999 ≈ 2.999565. Then the expression inside sqrt is [2*2.999565 - (2.999565)^2]/(2.999565 - 3). Let's compute numerator: 2*2.999565 ≈ 5.99913, (2.999565)^2 ≈ 8.9974. So numerator ≈ 5.99913 - 8.9974 ≈ -2.99827. Denominator ≈ -0.000435. So the expression is (-2.99827)/(-0.000435) ≈ 6894.5. Which is positive. Wait, but according to our inequality, in [2,3), the expression should be ≤ 0. Wait, this is positive. Hmm, that's contradictory.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the transformation. Let me go back.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Then log n ≈ 2.69897.

Compute numerator: 2*2.69897 - (2.69897)^2 ≈ 5.39794 - 7.284 ≈ -1.886.

Denominator: 2.69897 - 3 ≈ -0.30103.

So the fraction is (-1.886)/(-0.30103) ≈ 6.26, which is positive. Wait, but according to our inequality, it should be ≤ 0. Hmm, that contradicts. Wait, what's wrong here?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the transformation. Let me go back. The original expression inside the square root is [2x - x²]/(x - 3). Then I factored the numerator as -x(x - 2). So [2x - x²] = -x² + 2x = -x(x - 2). Therefore, the expression becomes [-x(x - 2)]/(x - 3) ≥ 0. Then I factored out the negative sign: - [x(x - 2)]/(x - 3) ≥ 0 ⇒ [x(x - 2)]/(x - 3) ≤ 0. That seems correct.

But when x is in [2, 3), let's take x=2.5. Then [x(x - 2)]/(x - 3) = [2.5*(0.5)]/( -0.5 ) = (1.25)/(-0.5) = -2.5 ≤ 0. So that's negative, which is okay. But when I computed for x=2.69897, which is in [2,3), I got a positive value. Wait, that's conflicting.

Wait, let me compute again. If x=2.69897, then numerator is 2x - x² = 2*2.69897 - (2.69897)^2 ≈ 5.39794 - 7.284 ≈ -1.886. Denominator is x - 3 ≈ -0.30103. So the fraction is (-1.886)/(-0.30103) ≈ 6.26. So that's positive. But according to the inequality, [x(x - 2)]/(x - 3) ≤ 0. So here, [2.69897*(0.69897)]/(-0.30103) ≈ (1.886)/(-0.30103) ≈ -6.26, which is ≤ 0. Wait, but numerator in the original expression is 2x - x², which is -1.886, denominator is x - 3 ≈ -0.30103. So the original expression is (-1.886)/(-0.30103) ≈ 6.26, which is positive. But according to our transformed inequality, we have [x(x - 2)]/(x - 3) ≤ 0. Let's compute [x(x - 2)]/(x - 3) for x=2.69897: [2.69897*(0.69897)]/( -0.30103 ) ≈ (1.886)/(-0.30103) ≈ -6.26 ≤ 0. So the transformed inequality is satisfied. However, the original expression is positive. Wait, that seems contradictory.

Wait, no. Wait, the original expression is [2x - x²]/(x - 3) = [ -x(x - 2) ]/(x - 3) = - [x(x - 2)]/(x - 3). Therefore, if [x(x - 2)]/(x - 3) ≤ 0, then - [x(x - 2)]/(x - 3) ≥ 0. Therefore, the original expression is ≥ 0. So, even though [x(x - 2)]/(x - 3) is ≤ 0, the original expression is its negative, which is ≥ 0. Therefore, the transformation is correct.

So, in the interval [2,3), [x(x - 2)]/(x - 3) ≤ 0, so the original expression is ≥ 0. Therefore, even though the transformed expression is negative, the original expression is positive because of the negative sign. So, that's okay. So, the original expression is non-negative in [2,3). Therefore, all those n are valid.

Therefore, my previous conclusion is correct. So total number of integers is 901.

Based on execution_2.1, execution_2.2:
Wait, but let me check with another value. Let's take x=2. Let's check x=2.

Then [2x - x²]/(x - 3) = (4 - 4)/(-1) = 0. So sqrt(0) is allowed. So x=2 is okay.

x=3 is excluded. So, seems like the intervals are correct.
</execution_3.1>
</Execution_3>

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
Therefore, the total number of integers n is 1 (from n=1) + 900 (from n=100 to 999 inclusive) = 901.

But let me double-check the count for n=100 to 999 inclusive.

<prompt_4.1> Verify the final count of integers n and confirm the solution. </prompt_4.1>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
The number of integers from 100 to 999 inclusive is 999 - 100 + 1 = 900. So 900 numbers. Plus n=1, total 901.

But wait, let me check if all these n satisfy that log n is real. Since n is a positive integer, log n is defined. So all n ≥ 1 are okay. So, yes.

Therefore, the answer should be 901.

Wait, but let me check again if there's any other condition. The original expression is sqrt( [2 log n - (log n)^2 ] / (log n - 3) ). For n=1, log n=0, so denominator log n -3 = -3. Numerator 0, so 0/-3=0. So sqrt(0) is allowed. For n=100, log n=2, numerator 0, denominator -1. 0/-1=0. For n=999, log n≈2.999565, which is in [2,3), so the numerator 2x - x² is negative, denominator x -3 is negative, so their ratio is positive. Therefore, all those n are okay.

But wait, let me check if there's any integer n in [100, 999] where log n is exactly an integer. For example, n=100, n=1000 (excluded), but 1000 is excluded. So n=100, 10000 (but 10000 is way beyond 999). So only n=100 is in the second interval where log n is exactly 2. All others in [100, 999] have log n between 2 and 3, not exactly 2 or 3.

Therefore, all n from 100 to 999 inclusive are valid, except n=1000 which is excluded. So 900 numbers. Plus n=1. Total 901.

Therefore, the answer is 901.
