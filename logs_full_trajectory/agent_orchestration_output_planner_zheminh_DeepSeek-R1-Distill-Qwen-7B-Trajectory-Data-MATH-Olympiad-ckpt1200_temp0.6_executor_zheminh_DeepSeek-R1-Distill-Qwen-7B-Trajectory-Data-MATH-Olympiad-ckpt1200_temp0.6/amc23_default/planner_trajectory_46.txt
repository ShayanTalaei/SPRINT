<Question>
When the roots of the polynomial 
\[P(x)  = (x-1)^1 (x-2)^2 (x-3)^3 \cdot \cdot \cdot (x-10)^{10}\]
are removed from the number line, what remains is the union of $11$ disjoint open intervals. On how many of these intervals is $P(x)$ positive?
</Question>

<think>
<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to figure out on how many of the 11 disjoint open intervals the polynomial P(x) is positive. The polynomial is given as P(x) = (x-1)^1 (x-2)^2 (x-3)^3 ... (x-10)^{10}. Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem step by step.

First, the roots of the polynomial are at x = 1, 2, 3, ...., 10. Each root x = n has multiplicity n. So, x=1 is a root of multiplicity 1, x=2 is multiplicity 2, and so on up to x=10 with multiplicity 10. When these roots are removed from the number line, we're left with open intervals between each consecutive pair of roots. Since there are 10 roots, the intervals would be (1,2), (2,3), ...., (9,10), and also the intervals extending to negative infinity and positive infinity. Wait, but the problem says there are 11 disjoint open intervals. Oh, right, because between each pair of consecutive roots, there's an interval, and then the intervals (-infty,1) and (10, infty). So total 11 intervals.

Now, the question is on how many of these intervals is P(x) positive. So I need to analyze the sign of P(x) on each of these intervals. The sign of the polynomial will alternate depending on the number of sign changes at each root. But since some roots have even multiplicities, they don't cause a sign change, while odd multiplicities do. So the key is to determine the sign in each interval by considering the multiplicity of the roots as we cross them.

Let me recall that when moving from left to right across a root with odd multiplicity, the sign of the polynomial changes, whereas for even multiplicity, the sign remains the same. So starting from the far left (negative infinity), the polynomial is positive or negative? Let's see.

<prompt_1.1> Determine the sign of the polynomial on the interval (-âˆž, 1). </prompt_1.1>

Now, moving from left to right, when we cross each root, the sign might change or not depending on the multiplicity. Let's go through each interval step by step.

First interval: (-infty, 1). As established, the polynomial is positive here.

<prompt_1.2> Analyze the sign of the polynomial in the interval (1, 2). </prompt_1.2>
-----

But let me confirm with another approach. Alternatively, we can consider the sign of P(x) in each interval by the number of negative factors.

<prompt_1.3> Use an alternative method to confirm the sign of the polynomial in each interval. </prompt_1.3>

Alternatively, we can use the fact that the number of sign changes is equal to the number of roots with odd multiplicities.

<prompt_1.4> Use the number of sign changes to confirm the sign of the polynomial in each interval. </prompt_1.4>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
The polynomial P(x) is a product of factors (x-1), (x-2)^2, ...., (x-10)^{10}. If we plug in a very large negative x, say x = -N where N is a large positive number, each term (x - n) becomes (-N - n) which is negative. So each factor (x - n) is negative. Now, the polynomial P(x) is the product of these terms. The exponents on each (x - n) are from 1 to 10. So, the sign of P(x) will depend on the product of the signs of each factor. Since each (x - n) is negative when x is very large negative, we have 10 negative factors. Multiplying 10 negative numbers: (-1)^10 = 1. So the product is positive. Therefore, P(x) is positive on (-infty, 1).
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
Let me check that. Since all exponents are even? Wait, no. The exponents are from 1 to 10. So the first interval is before the first root, x=1. Let me see: when x is very large negative, say x approaches -infty, each term (x - n) is negative, since x is much less than n. So (x-1) is negative, (x-2) is negative, etc. Each factor is negative. But each factor is raised to a power: (x-1)^1, (x-2)^2, ...., (x-10)^{10}. So, the sign of each term is:

(x-1)^1: negative (since odd exponent, negative base)
(x-2)^2: positive (even exponent, negative base squared)
(x-3)^3: negative (odd exponent, negative base)
... and so on, alternating signs.

Therefore, the total number of negative factors is equal to the number of odd exponents. Let's check: exponents from 1 to 10. The exponents that are odd are 1,3,5,7,9. So five terms are negative, and the others are positive. So the product of all terms would be negative^5 * positive^5. Since 5 is odd, the product is negative. Therefore, in (-infty,1), P(x) is negative.
</execution_1.2>

<execution_1.3>
For example, in the interval (k, k+1), the factors (x-1), (x-2), ...., (x-10) will have different signs. But since each factor (x - n) is negative when x < n and positive when x > n. So, in each interval, each factor (x - n) is either negative or positive. The exponents don't affect the sign, only the parity. So even exponents make the factor positive, odd exponents make it negative if x < n, but actually, regardless of the exponent, (x - n) is negative if x < n, positive if x > n. The exponent's parity affects whether the factor is positive or negative when raised to that power. Wait, no. Wait, if (x - n) is negative and raised to an even exponent, it becomes positive; if raised to an odd exponent, it remains negative. So, the sign of each factor depends on both x and the exponent. Hmm, this complicates things.

Wait, maybe my initial approach was better. Let's try again. Let's consider each interval and check the sign.

Starting with the leftmost interval, (-infty, 1). For x < 1, all (x - n) are negative. Each term (x - n)^m will be positive if m is even and negative if m is odd. So, the sign of the entire product is the product of the signs of each term. So, for each root n, if the exponent m is odd, the term is negative; if even, positive. Therefore, the sign of P(x) is the product of (-1)^{m_n} for each root n, where m_n is the exponent. So, for each root n, if m_n is odd, it contributes a factor of -1; if even, +1. Therefore, the total sign is the product over all roots of (-1)^{m_n}.
</execution_1.3>

<execution_1.4>
Wait, actually, maybe not. Let me think. The sign of the polynomial in each interval can be determined by the number of negative factors in the product. Each factor (x - k)^m will be positive if x > k and negative if x < k. So, in each interval, some factors will be positive and some negative. The total number of negative factors will determine the sign. If the number of negative factors is even, the product is positive; if odd, negative.

So, let's take an interval between two roots, say between k and k+1. In this interval, x is greater than k but less than k+1. Therefore, the factors (x - k)^m will be positive (since x > k), but all factors (x - j)^m where j > k will be negative (since x < j). So, the number of negative factors is the sum of the multiplicities of all roots greater than k. If that sum is even, the product is positive; if odd, negative.

Therefore, to compute the sign in each interval (k, k+1), we need to compute the total multiplicity of roots greater than k. If that total multiplicity is even, the sign is positive; else, negative.

So, let's compute this for each interval.

Starting from the leftmost interval (-infty, 1). Here, all roots are greater than x, so the total multiplicity is the sum of all roots: 1+2+3+...+10. Let's compute that sum. Sum from 1 to 10 is (10*11)/2 = 55. 55 is odd, so the total multiplicity is odd. Wait, but we said that in the interval (-infty,1), all roots are to the right, so the total multiplicity is 55. Since 55 is odd, the number of negative factors is 55, which is odd, so the product is negative. Wait, but earlier I thought it was positive. Hmm, there's a contradiction here. Which is correct?

Wait, let's re-examine. In the interval (-infty,1), x is less than all roots. Therefore, each factor (x - j)^m is negative, since x - j < 0. Therefore, each factor is negative. The number of negative factors is 10 (since there are 10 roots). Wait, but actually, each factor is (x - j)^m. If x < j, then (x - j) is negative, but raised to some power m. If m is even, then (x - j)^m is positive; if m is odd, negative. Therefore, the number of negative factors is the number of roots j for which m is odd. So, in the interval (-infty,1), x < 1, so all roots j=1,2,...,10. For each root j, the exponent m is j. So, the number of negative factors is the number of j where j is odd, since m = j. So, exponents for roots 1,3,5,7,9 are odd, so their factors will be negative. The roots 2,4,6,8,10 have even exponents, so their factors will be positive. Therefore, the number of negative factors is 5 (roots 1,3,5,7,9). 5 is odd, so the product is negative. Therefore, in (-infty,1), P(x) is negative. So my initial thought was wrong. The sign is determined by the number of roots with odd multiplicity. Wait, but in this case, the roots with odd multiplicity are 1,3,5,7,9. So 5 roots. So the number of negative factors is 5. 5 is odd, so the product is negative. Therefore, in (-infty,1), P(x) is negative.

Similarly, in the interval (1,2), x is greater than 1 but less than 2. So, for root j=1, x >1, so (x -1)^1 is positive. For j=2, x <2, so (x -2)^2 is positive (since exponent is even). For j=3, x <3, so (x -3)^3 is negative (exponent odd). Similarly, j=4: (x -4)^4 is positive, j=5: negative, etc. So, the number of negative factors is the number of roots j where j is odd and greater than 1. So, roots 3,5,7,9. That's 4 roots. 4 is even. Therefore, the product is positive. Therefore, in (1,2), P(x) is positive.

Wait, so this seems different from the previous approach. So maybe my initial approach was flawed. Let's clarify.

The sign of P(x) in an interval is determined by the product of (x - j)^m for j from 1 to 10. For each factor, if x is in (k, k+1), then for j <=k, (x - j) is positive, so (x - j)^m is positive if m is even, negative if m is odd. For j >k, (x - j) is negative, so (x - j)^m is positive if m is even, negative if m is odd. Therefore, in the interval (k, k+1), the sign is determined by the product of all factors where j <=k have exponents odd or even, and factors where j >k have exponents odd or even.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe another approach is better. Let's consider that when moving from left to right across a root j, the sign of the polynomial changes if the multiplicity of j is odd, and remains the same if even. Therefore, starting from (-infty,1), where all roots are to the right, and the sign is negative (as we saw). Then, when crossing x=1 (odd multiplicity), the sign changes. So, moving from (-infty,1) to (1,2), the sign flips from negative to positive. Then, crossing x=2 (even multiplicity), sign remains the same, so (1,2) to (2,3) is still positive. Then crossing x=3 (odd multiplicity), sign flips again to negative, and so on.

So, starting from negative infinity: sign is negative. Cross x=1 (odd): sign becomes positive. Cross x=2 (even): sign remains positive. Cross x=3 (odd): sign becomes negative. Cross x=4 (even): remains negative. Cross x=5 (odd): sign becomes positive. Cross x=6 (even): remains positive. Cross x=7 (odd): sign becomes negative. Cross x=8 (even): remains negative. Cross x=9 (odd): sign becomes positive. Cross x=10 (even): remains positive. Then, after x=10, sign remains positive.

So, the intervals and their signs:

1. (-infty,1): negative

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1, execution_1.2:
Now, moving to the next interval (1, 2). Since x is between 1 and 2, we cross the root x=1. The multiplicity of x=1 is 1, which is odd. Therefore, crossing an odd multiplicity root changes the sign of the polynomial. Since the previous interval was negative, the next interval should be positive.

Let me verify this.
In the interval (1, 2), x is greater than 1 but less than 2. So for x in (1, 2):

<prompt_2.1> Verify the sign of the polynomial in the interval (1, 2). </prompt_2.1>

Based on execution_1.2:
Now, moving to the next interval (2, 3). The root x=2 has multiplicity 2, which is even. Crossing an even multiplicity root does not change the sign. Therefore, the sign remains the same as the previous interval, which was positive. Therefore, in (2, 3), P(x) is positive.

<prompt_2.2> Determine the sign of the polynomial in the interval (2, 3) and subsequent intervals. </prompt_2.2>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
For x in (1, 2), (x - 1) is positive (since x > 1), and (x - 2) is negative (since x < 2). The exponents are 1 and 2. So (x - 1)^1 is positive, (x - 2)^2 is positive (since even exponent). Therefore, all factors are positive, so the product is positive. Therefore, in (1, 2), P(x) is positive.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Let's check this. For x in (2,3), x is greater than 2 but less than 3. So, for root 1: (x -1)^1 is positive. Root 2: (x -2)^2 is positive. Root 3: (x -3)^3 is negative. Roots 4 to 10: (x - j)^j. For j=4 to 10, x < j, so (x - j) is negative. The exponents for these roots are 4,5,6,....,10. So, for j=4: exponent 4, even, so positive. j=5: exponent 5, odd, negative. j=6: exponent 6, even, positive. j=7: exponent 7, odd, negative. j=8: exponent 8, even, positive. j=9: exponent 9, odd, negative. j=10: exponent 10, even, positive. So, in the interval (2,3), the negative factors are roots 3,5,7,9. That's four roots. Each with odd exponents. So, the number of negative factors is 4. 4 is even, so the product is positive. Therefore, in (2,3), P(x) is positive.

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1, execution_2.2:
Wait, but when we cross x=2, which has even multiplicity, the sign doesn't change. So starting from positive in (1,2), crossing x=2 (even) keeps it positive. Then moving to (2,3). Let's check the factors again.

<prompt_3.1> Verify the sign of the polynomial in the interval (3, 4). </prompt_3.1>

Based on execution_2.2:
3. (2, 3): positive
4. (3, 4): negative
5. (4, 5): negative
6. (5, 6): positive
7. (6, 7): positive
8. (7, 8): negative
9. (8, 9): negative
10. (9,10): positive
11. (10, âˆž): positive

Now, let's count the intervals where P(x) is positive. From the list above:

<prompt_3.2> Count the intervals where the polynomial is positive. </prompt_3.2>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
In (2,3), x is between 2 and 3. So:

- (x -1)^1: positive
- (x -2)^2: positive
- (x -3)^3: negative
- (x -4)^4: positive
- (x -5)^5: negative
- (x -6)^6: positive
- (x -7)^7: negative
- (x -8)^8: positive
- (x -9)^9: negative
- (x -10)^{10}: positive

So, the negative factors are (x -3)^3, (x -5)^5, (x -7)^7, (x -9)^9. That's four negative factors. Since 4 is even, the total product is positive. So yes, (2,3) is positive.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
1. (1,2): positive
3. (2,3): positive
4. (3,4): negative
5. (4,5): negative
6. (5,6): positive
7. (6,7): positive
8. (7,8): negative
9. (8,9): negative
10. (9,10): positive
11. (10, âˆž): positive

So positive intervals are 1,3,6,7,10,11. That's 6 intervals. Wait, let me count again:

1. (1,2) - positive
3. (2,3) - positive
6. (5,6) - positive
7. (6,7) - positive
10. (9,10) - positive
11. (10, âˆž) - positive

Yes, that's 6 intervals. But wait, according to the previous sign changes, after crossing x=3 (odd), the sign flips to negative. Then crossing x=4 (even), stays negative. x=5 (odd), flips to positive. x=6 (even), stays positive. x=7 (odd), flips to negative. x=8 (even), stays negative. x=9 (odd), flips to positive. x=10 (even), stays positive. Then x=11 (if there was one), but there isn't. So the final interval (10, âˆž) remains positive.

So the positive intervals are:

(1,2), (2,3), (5,6), (6,7), (9,10), (10, âˆž). That's 6 intervals.

But wait, the original problem says there are 11 intervals. Let me confirm:

Original roots at 1,2,....,10, so the intervals are:

1. (-infty,1)
2. (1,2)
3. (2,3)
4. (3,4)
5. (4,5)
6. (5,6)
7. (6,7)
8. (7,8)
9. (8,9)
10. (9,10)
11. (10, âˆž)

Yes, 11 intervals. So the positive ones are 2,3,6,7,10,11. That's 6 intervals.

But let me check again. Maybe there's a mistake in counting. Let's list them:

1. (-infty,1): negative
2. (1,2): positive
3. (2,3): positive
4. (3,4): negative
5. (4,5): negative
6. (5,6): positive
7. (6,7): positive
8. (7,8): negative
9. (8,9): negative
10. (9,10): positive
11. (10, âˆž): positive

Positive intervals: 2,3,6,7,10,11. That's 6 intervals.

But let me check with another approach. Let's consider the number of sign changes. Each time we cross a root with odd multiplicity, the sign changes. Roots with even multiplicity don't change the sign.

Based on execution_3.2:
Therefore, the answer should be 6.

But let me check once again with a smaller example to verify.

<prompt_4.2> Perform a final verification of the solution with a smaller example. </prompt_4.2>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
So the total number of sign changes is equal to the number of roots with odd multiplicities. In this case, the roots with odd multiplicities are 1,3,5,7,9. So 5 roots. Therefore, the sign will change 5 times. Starting from the leftmost interval, which is negative, then after 5 sign changes, the sign will be negative again? Wait, starting from negative, each sign change flips the sign. So starting negative, after 1 change: positive, after 2: negative, after 3: positive, after 4: negative, after 5: positive. So the final sign after crossing all 10 roots would be positive? But according to our previous analysis, the last interval (10, âˆž) is positive. So that matches.

But the number of positive intervals would be the number of times the sign is positive. Since the sign starts negative, and changes 5 times, the sign alternates between negative and positive each time. So the intervals would be:

1. (-infty,1): negative
2. (1,2): positive
3. (2,3): negative
4. (3,4): positive
5. (4,5): negative
6. (5,6): positive
7. (6,7): negative
8. (7,8): positive
9. (8,9): negative
10. (9,10): positive
11. (10, âˆž): positive

Wait, this seems different. Wait, according to this, starting from negative, then positive, negative, positive, etc. But according to the previous detailed analysis, after crossing x=1 (odd), positive; x=2 (even), stays positive; x=3 (odd), flips to negative; x=4 (even), stays negative; x=5 (odd), flips to positive; x=6 (even), stays positive; x=7 (odd), flips to negative; x=8 (even), stays negative; x=9 (odd), flips to positive; x=10 (even), stays positive. Therefore, the intervals would be:

1. (-infty,1): negative
2. (1,2): positive
3. (2,3): positive
4. (3,4): negative
5. (4,5): negative
6. (5,6): positive
7. (6,7): positive
8. (7,8): negative
9. (8,9): negative
10. (9,10): positive
11. (10, âˆž): positive

Wait, this contradicts the earlier list. Which one is correct? Let me check step by step.

Starting with (-infty,1): negative.

Cross x=1 (odd): sign changes to positive. So (1,2): positive.

Cross x=2 (even): sign remains positive. So (2,3): positive.

Cross x=3 (odd): sign changes to negative. So (3,4): negative.

Cross x=4 (even): sign remains negative. So (4,5): negative.

Cross x=5 (odd): sign changes to positive. So (5,6): positive.

Cross x=6 (even): sign remains positive. So (6,7): positive.

Cross x=7 (odd): sign changes to negative. So (7,8): negative.

Cross x=8 (even): sign remains negative. So (8,9): negative.

Cross x=9 (odd): sign changes to positive. So (9,10): positive.

Cross x=10 (even): sign remains positive. So (10, âˆž): positive.

Therefore, the positive intervals are:

(1,2), (2,3), (5,6), (6,7), (9,10), (10, âˆž). That's 6 intervals. The negative intervals are:

(-infty,1), (3,4), (4,5), (7,8), (8,9). That's 5 intervals. Wait, but 6 positive and 5 negative, total 11 intervals. Correct.

But earlier, when I thought the sign alternates each time, but in reality, since crossing even roots doesn't change the sign, the alternation is only when crossing odd roots. Since there are 5 odd roots, the sign changes 5 times. Starting from negative, the sequence would be:

1. (-infty,1): negative
2. (1,2): positive (1 sign change)
3. (2,3): positive (no change)
4. (3,4): negative (2nd sign change)
5. (4,5): negative (no change)
6. (5,6): positive (3rd sign change)
7. (6,7): positive (no change)
8. (7,8): negative (4th sign change)
9. (8,9): negative (no change)
10. (9,10): positive (5th sign change)
11. (10, âˆž): positive (no change)

Therefore, the positive intervals are positions 2,3,6,7,10,11. That's 6 intervals. Therefore, the answer is 6.

But wait, according to the initial detailed analysis, (5,6) is positive, (6,7) is positive, (9,10) is positive, and (10, âˆž) is positive. So that's 4 intervals. But according to this step-by-step crossing, it's 6 intervals. So there must be a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the first detailed analysis. Let me check again.

<execution_4.2>
Suppose we have P(x) = (x-1)^1 (x-2)^2. The roots are at 1 and 2. The intervals are (-infty,1), (1,2), (2, âˆž). The sign in (-infty,1): negative (since x <1, both factors negative, odd + even = negative). Crossing x=1 (odd), sign flips to positive in (1,2). Crossing x=2 (even), sign remains positive. So (2, âˆž) is positive. So positive intervals: (1,2), (2, âˆž). That's 2 intervals. Which matches: roots 1 (odd) causes a sign change, root 2 (even) doesn't. So positive intervals: 2. So similar logic applies.

Therefore, applying this to the original problem, with 11 intervals, 6 are positive. Therefore, the answer is 6.
