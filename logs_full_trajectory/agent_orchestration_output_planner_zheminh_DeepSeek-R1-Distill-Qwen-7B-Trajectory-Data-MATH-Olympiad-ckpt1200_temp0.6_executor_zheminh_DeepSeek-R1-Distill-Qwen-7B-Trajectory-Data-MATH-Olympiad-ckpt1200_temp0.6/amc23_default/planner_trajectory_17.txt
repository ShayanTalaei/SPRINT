Okay, so I need to find the value of \( a_{2023} \) in the given expression for \( \tan 2023x \). The problem states that there's a unique sequence of integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2023} \) such that:

\[
\tan 2023x = \frac{a_1 \tan x + a_3 \tan^3 x + a_5 \tan^5 x + \cdots + a_{2023} \tan^{2023} x}{1 + a_2 \tan^2 x + a_4 \tan^4 x + \cdots + a_{2022} \tan^{2022} x}
\]

whenever \( \tan 2023x \) is defined. Hmm, this looks like an expansion of \( \tan 2023x \) in terms of powers of \( \tan x \). I remember that multiple-angle formulas for tangent can be expressed using binomial coefficients or something related to the tangent addition formula. Let me think.

First, the tangent of a multiple angle can be expanded using the formula:

\[
\tan(nx) = \frac{\sum_{k=1}^{n} \binom{n}{2k-1} (-1)^{k-1} \tan^{2k-1}x}{1 + \sum_{k=1}^{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor} \binom{n}{2k} (-1)^k \tan^{2k}x}
\]

Wait, is that right?

<prompt_1.1> Verify the formula for multiple-angle tangent expansions. </prompt_1.1>

So, applying this to \( \tan 2023x \), the numerator should be the sum of odd powers of \( \tan x \) with coefficients \( (-1)^{k-1} \binom{2023}{2k-1} \), and the denominator is 1 plus the sum of even powers with coefficients \( (-1)^k \binom{2023}{2k} \). Therefore, in the given expression, the coefficients \( a_{2k-1} \) in the numerator would be \( (-1)^{k-1} \binom{2023}{2k-1} \), and the coefficients \( a_{2k} \) in the denominator would be \( (-1)^k \binom{2023}{2k} \).

Let me check with a smaller multiple angle, like \( \tan(3x) \). The formula for \( \tan(3x) \) is:

\[
\tan(3x) = \frac{3\tan x - \tan^3 x}{1 - 3\tan^2 x}
\]

Comparing this to the given expression, if \( n = 3 \), then the numerator should be \( \binom{3}{1} \tan x - \binom{3}{3} \tan^3 x \), which is \( 3\tan x - \tan^3 x \). The denominator would be \( 1 - \binom{3}{2} \tan^2 x \), which is \( 1 - 3\tan^2 x \). So that seems to check out. Therefore, the formula does hold for \( n = 3 \).
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
So, for \( a_{2023} \), which is the coefficient of \( \tan^{2023}x \) in the numerator, we need to find the value when \( 2k - 1 = 2023 \). Solving for \( k \), we get \( k = (2023 + 1)/2 = 1012 \). So, the coefficient is \( (-1)^{1012 - 1} \binom{2023}{2023} \). Wait, \( \binom{2023}{2023} = 1 \), and \( (-1)^{1011} = -1 \). So, \( a_{2023} = -1 \).

Wait, but let me verify this again. The formula for the numerator coefficient of \( \tan^{2m-1}x \) is \( (-1)^{m-1} \binom{n}{2m-1} \). Here, \( 2m - 1 = 2023 \), so \( m = (2023 + 1)/2 = 1012 \). Therefore, the coefficient is \( (-1)^{1012 - 1} \binom{2023}{2023} = (-1)^{1011} \times 1 = -1 \).

Based on execution_1.1, execution_1.2:
But wait, let me make sure that the formula is correctly applied here.

<prompt_2.1> Verify the application of the formula for the given problem. </prompt_2.1>

But let me check another way. Let's consider the expansion using complex numbers or Euler's formula. Remember that \( \tan x = \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} \), and multiple-angle identities can be derived using De Moivre's formula.

<prompt_2.2> Explore an alternative method using complex numbers and De Moivre's formula. </prompt_2.2>

Therefore, the answer is \boxed{-1}.

But wait, let me check with a specific example. Let's take \( n = 1 \).

<prompt_2.3> Confirm the result with specific examples for n=1, 2, and 3. </prompt_2.3>

Another example: \( n = 2 \). Then \( \tan(2x) = \frac{2\tan x}{1 - \tan^2 x} \). Here, the numerator is \( 2\tan x \), so the coefficient \( a_1 = 2 \).

<prompt_2.4> Verify the formula with n=2 and n=3. </prompt_2.4>

Similarly, for \( n = 4 \), \( \tan(4x) = \frac{4\tan x - 4\tan^3 x}{1 - 6\tan^2 x + \tan^4 x} \). Here, the coefficient of \( \tan^4 x \) in the denominator is 1, so \( a_4 = 1 \).

The formula for the numerator of \( \tan(nx) \) is indeed:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{\lceil n/2 \rceil} (-1)^{k-1} \binom{n}{2k-1} \tan^{2k-1}x
\]

and the denominator is:

\[
1 + \sum_{k=1}^{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor} (-1)^k \binom{n}{2k} \tan^{2k}x
\]

Therefore, in our problem, since \( n = 2023 \), which is an odd number, the highest power in the numerator is \( 2023 \), which corresponds to \( k = \lceil 2023/2 \rceil = 1012 \). Therefore, the coefficient \( a_{2023} \) is indeed \( (-1)^{1012 - 1} \binom{2023}{2023} = -1 \).
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
For \( \tan(2023x) \), we can write:

\[
\sin(2023x) + i\cos(2023x) = (\cos x + i\sin x)^{2023}
\]

Expanding the right-hand side using the binomial theorem:

\[
\sum_{k=0}^{2023} \binom{2023}{k} \cos^{2023 - k}x (i\sin x)^k
\]

Then, equating real and imaginary parts:

Real part: \( \cos(2023x) = \sum_{k=0}^{1011} (-1)^k \binom{2023}{2k} \cos^{2023 - 2k}x \sin^{2k}x \)

Imaginary part: \( \sin(2023x) = \sum_{k=0}^{1011} (-1)^k \binom{2023}{2k + 1} \cos^{2022 - 2k}x \sin^{2k + 1}x \)

Dividing the imaginary part by the real part gives \( \tan(2023x) \):

\[
\tan(2023x) = \frac{\sum_{k=0}^{1011} (-1)^k \binom{2023}{2k + 1} \cos^{2022 - 2k}x \sin^{2k + 1}x}{\sum_{k=0}^{1011} (-1)^k \binom{2023}{2k} \cos^{2023 - 2k}x \sin^{2k}x}
\]

Dividing numerator and denominator by \( \cos^{2023}x \):

Numerator: \( \sum_{k=0}^{1011} (-1)^k \binom{2023}{2k + 1} \tan^{2k + 1}x \)

Denominator: \( \sum_{k=0}^{1011} (-1)^k \binom{2023}{2k} \tan^{2k}x \)

Which matches the given expression. Therefore, the coefficients \( a_{2k + 1} \) in the numerator are \( (-1)^k \binom{2023}{2k + 1} \), and the coefficients \( a_{2k} \) in the denominator are \( (-1)^k \binom{2023}{2k} \). Wait, but in the problem statement, the denominator is written as \( 1 + a_2 \tan^2 x + \ldots + a_{2022} \tan^{2022}x \). So, the coefficients \( a_{2k} \) correspond to \( (-1)^k \binom{2023}{2k} \).

Therefore, the coefficient \( a_{2023} \) in the numerator is when \( 2k + 1 = 2023 \), so \( k = (2023 - 1)/2 = 1011 \). Therefore, \( a_{2023} = (-1)^{1011} \binom{2023}{2023} = (-1)^{1011} \times 1 = -1 \).
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
Then \( \tan x = \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} \), and \( \tan(1x) = \tan x \), so the numerator is \( \tan x \) and the denominator is 1. So, \( a_1 = 1 \), which matches \( (-1)^{1 - 1} \binom{1}{1} = 1 \).

For \( n = 2 \), the formula gives \( a_1 = 2 \), which is correct because \( \tan(2x) = \frac{2\tan x}{1 - \tan^2 x} \). The coefficient of \( \tan x \) is 2. So that works.

For \( n = 3 \), as we saw earlier, the coefficient of \( \tan^3 x \) is \( -1 \), which matches the example.

Therefore, the formula seems correct. So, applying it to \( n = 2023 \), the coefficient \( a_{2023} \) is indeed \( -1 \).
</execution_2.3>

<execution_2.4>
The coefficient \( a_2 \) would be the coefficient of \( \tan^2 x \), but since there's no \( \tan^2 x \) term in the numerator, it's 0. Wait, but according to the formula, for \( n = 2 \), the denominator would be \( 1 - \binom{2}{2} \tan^2 x = 1 - 1 \tan^2 x \), so \( a_2 = -1 \). But in the actual expansion, the denominator is \( 1 - \tan^2 x \), so \( a_2 = -1 \). However, in the numerator, the coefficients are \( \binom{2}{1} \tan x \), so \( a_1 = 2 \). So, in this case, for \( n = 2 \), \( a_1 = 2 \), \( a_2 = -1 \).
</execution_2.4>

<execution_2.5>
Wait, but in the denominator, the coefficient of \( \tan^{2k}x \) is \( (-1)^k \binom{n}{2k} \). So, for \( n = 4 \), \( a_4 \) is the coefficient of \( \tan^4x \) in the denominator, which is \( (-1)^2 \binom{4}{4} = 1 \times 1 = 1 \). So that's correct. Similarly, for \( n = 3 \), the coefficient \( a_2 \) is \( (-1)^1 \binom{3}{2} = -3 \), which matches \( \tan(3x) \) denominator coefficient.

Thus, the final answer is \boxed{-1}.
