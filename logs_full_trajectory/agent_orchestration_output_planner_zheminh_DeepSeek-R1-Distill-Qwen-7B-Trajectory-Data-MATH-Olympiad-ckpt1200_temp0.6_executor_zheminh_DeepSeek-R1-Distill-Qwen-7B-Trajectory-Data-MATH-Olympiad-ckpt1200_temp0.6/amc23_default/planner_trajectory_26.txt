<Question>
In the $xy$-plane, a circle of radius $4$ with center on the positive $x$-axis is tangent to the $y$-axis at the origin, and a circle with radius $10$ with center on the positive $y$-axis is tangent to the $x$-axis at the origin. What is the slope of the line passing through the two points at which these circles intersect?

Okay, let me try to figure out this problem step by step. So, we have two circles in the xy-plane. The first circle has a radius of 4 and its center is on the positive x-axis. It's also tangent to the y-axis at the origin. The second circle has a radius of 10, its center is on the positive y-axis, and it's tangent to the x-axis at the origin. We need to find the slope of the line that passes through the two intersection points of these circles. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

First, let me visualize this. The first circle is on the x-axis, so its center must be at some point (a, 0) where a is positive. Since it's tangent to the y-axis at the origin, the distance from the center to the y-axis should be equal to the radius. The distance from (a, 0) to the y-axis is just 'a', so that must be equal to 4. Therefore, the center of the first circle is at (4, 0). Similarly, the second circle is on the y-axis, so its center is at (0, b) where b is positive.
Since it's tangent to the x-axis at the origin, the distance from the center to the x-axis is 'b', which should be equal to the radius, which is 10. Therefore, the center of the second circle is at (0, 10).

Now, we have two circles:
1. Circle 1: Center (4, 0), radius 4.
2. Circle 2: Center (0, 10), radius 10.

We need to find the points where these two circles intersect and then find the slope of the line connecting those two points.

To find the intersection points, we can set up the equations of both circles and solve them simultaneously. Let me write down the equations.

Let me think if there's another way to approach this, maybe using geometry instead of algebra. Sometimes, geometric interpretations can provide insights or alternative methods.

For instance, the line connecting the two intersection points is called the radical axis of the two circles. The radical axis is perpendicular to the line joining the centers of the two circles. The centers here are at (4, 0) and (0, 10). The line connecting these centers has a slope of (10 - 0)/(0 - 4) = -10/4 = -5/2. Therefore, the radical axis should be perpendicular to this line, so its slope should be the negative reciprocal, which is 2/5. Wait, that's the same answer as before!

But wait, the radical axis is perpendicular to the line connecting the centers, but in this case, the radical axis is the line connecting the intersection points, which we found to have a slope of 2/5. However, the line connecting the centers has a slope of -5/2, so the negative reciprocal is indeed 2/5.
Therefore, the radical axis is the line with slope 2/5. Therefore, the slope of the line passing through the intersection points is 2/5.

Circle 1: (x - 4)^2 + (y - 0)^2 = 4^2 → (x - 4)^2 + y^2 = 16

Circle 2: (x - 0)^2 + (y - 10)^2 = 10^2 → x^2 + (y - 10)^2 = 100

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
To find the intersection points, we need to solve these two equations simultaneously. Let me subtract the equation of Circle 1 from Circle 2 to eliminate the squared terms. That might help us find the equation of the radical axis, which is the line we need.

<prompt_2.1> Subtract the equation of Circle 1 from Circle 2 to find the radical axis equation. </prompt_2.1>

Based on execution_1.1:
So, equations:

1. (x - 4)^2 + y^2 = 16

2. x^2 + (y - 10)^2 = 100

Let me expand both equations.

<prompt_2.2> Expand and simplify the equations of both circles to find the radical axis. </prompt_2.2>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Let's write that out:

[x^2 + (y - 10)^2] - [(x - 4)^2 + y^2] = 100 - 16

Simplify the left side:

x^2 + (y^2 - 20y + 100) - (x^2 - 8x + 16 + y^2) = 84

Expanding the terms:

x^2 + y^2 - 20y + 100 - x^2 + 8x - 16 - y^2 = 84

Simplify term by term:

x^2 - x^2 = 0

y^2 - y^2 = 0

-20y remains

100 - 16 = 84

+8x remains

So combining:

8x - 20y + 84 = 84

Subtract 84 from both sides:

8x - 20y = 0

Simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 4:

2x - 5y = 0

So, the radical axis is the line 2x - 5y = 0, which is the same as y = (2/5)x.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Expanding equation 1:

(x^2 - 8x + 16) + y^2 = 16

Simplify:

x^2 - 8x + 16 + y^2 = 16

Subtract 16 from both sides:

x^2 - 8x + y^2 = 0

Expanding equation 2:

x^2 + (y^2 - 20y + 100) = 100

Simplify:

x^2 + y^2 - 20y + 100 = 100

Subtract 100 from both sides:

x^2 + y^2 - 20y = 0

Now, subtract equation 1 from equation 2:

(x^2 + y^2 - 20y) - (x^2 - 8x + y^2) = 0 - 0

Simplify:

x^2 + y^2 - 20y - x^2 + 8x - y^2 = 0

The x^2 and y^2 terms cancel out:

-20y + 8x = 0

Rearranging:

8x - 20y = 0

Divide both sides by 4:

2x - 5y = 0

So, the equation of the radical axis is 2x - 5y = 0, which is the same as y = (2/5)x.

Based on execution_2.1:
So, the line connecting the two intersection points has slope 2/5. Therefore, the answer should be 2 + 5 = 7.

Based on execution_2.2:
Therefore, the slope is 2/5, so m = 2, n = 5, and m + n = 7.

Let me verify this another way. Suppose we solve the equations of the two circles.

Alternatively, we can parametrize one circle and substitute into the other, but that might be more complicated. Alternatively, let's try solving the system of equations we have.

We have:

1. (x - 4)^2 + y^2 = 16

2. x^2 + (y - 10)^2 = 100

We can subtract equation 1 from equation 2, which we did earlier, resulting in 2x - 5y = 0. So, y = (2/5)x. Then substitute this into one of the original equations, say equation 1.

So, substitute y = (2/5)x into equation 1:

(x - 4)^2 + [(2/5)x]^2 = 16

Expand (x - 4)^2: x^2 - 8x + 16

Expand [(2/5)x]^2: (4/25)x^2

So, equation becomes:

x^2 - 8x + 16 + (4/25)x^2 = 16

Multiply all terms by 25 to eliminate denominators:

25x^2 - 200x + 400 + 4x^2 = 400

Combine like terms:

29x^2 - 200x + 400 = 400

Subtract 400 from both sides:

29x^2 - 200x = 0

Factor out x:

x(29x - 200) = 0

So, solutions are x = 0 or 29x - 200 = 0 → x = 200/29

Therefore, the x-coordinates of the intersection points are x = 0 and x = 200/29.

Wait, but x = 0? Let me check that. If x = 0, then from y = (2/5)x, y = 0. So, the point (0, 0) is an intersection point? But both circles are tangent to the axes at the origin. The first circle is tangent to the y-axis at (0,0), and the second is tangent to the x-axis at (0,0). So, does the origin lie on both circles?

Let's check.

For the first circle: center (4, 0), radius 4. The distance from (4, 0) to (0, 0) is 4, which is equal to the radius. So, yes, (0, 0) is on the first circle.

For the second circle: center (0, 10), radius 10. The distance from (0, 10) to (0, 0) is 10, which is equal to the radius. So, (0, 0) is on the second circle as well.

Therefore, (0, 0) is indeed an intersection point. But wait, the problem says "the two points at which these circles intersect". If the circles are tangent at the origin, does that mean they only intersect at the origin? But according to the equations, they intersect at (0, 0) and (200/29, (2/5)(200/29)).

Wait, that seems contradictory. If the circles are tangent at the origin, they should only intersect at that point, right? But according to the equations, there are two intersection points: the origin and another point. So, there must be a mistake here.

Wait, let's think again. If two circles are tangent to each other at a point, they intersect at only that point. But here, both circles are tangent to the x-axis and y-axis at the origin, respectively. So, the first circle is tangent to the y-axis at (0,0), and the second is tangent to the x-axis at (0,0). Therefore, each circle is tangent to the other axis at the origin, but they might also intersect at another point. So, the circles are not tangent to each other; they are each tangent to the axes. So, the origin is a common point of tangency for each circle with their respective axes, but the two circles themselves intersect at the origin and another point.
Therefore, there are two intersection points: the origin and another point. Therefore, the line passing through these two points is the line connecting (0,0) and (200/29, 80/29), which has slope (80/29 - 0)/(200/29 - 0) = (80/29)/(200/29) = 80/200 = 2/5. So, that's consistent with the previous result.

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
But wait, the problem states that the circles are tangent to the y-axis and x-axis at the origin. So, each circle is tangent to one axis at the origin, but they might not be tangent to each other. So, the circles intersect at the origin and another point, hence two points. Therefore, the line through these two points is the radical axis, which we found as y = (2/5)x, so slope 2/5. Therefore, the answer is 2 + 5 = 7.
