Okay, let's see. I need to find the value of this series: 2³ - 1³ + 4³ - 3³ + 6³ - 5³ + ... + 18³ - 17³. Hmm. So it's an alternating sum of cubes where each pair is (even number)³ minus (previous odd number)³. Let me try to write out the terms to see the pattern better.

<prompt_1.1> Analyze the given series and write out the terms to identify the pattern and structure of the series. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
First term: 2³ - 1³
Second term: 4³ - 3³
Third term: 6³ - 5³
...
Last term: 18³ - 17³

So each term is of the form (2n)³ - (2n - 1)³ where n starts from 1. Let's check:

For n=1: 2³ -1³, correct.
For n=2:4³ -3³, correct.
...
For n=9:18³ -17³, since 2*9=18. So there are 9 such pairs.

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
So the series is the sum from n=1 to n=9 of [(2n)³ - (2n -1)³]. Maybe I can find a general formula for each pair and then sum them up.

Alternatively, maybe expanding the cubes and simplifying each term could help. Let's try expanding (2n)³ - (2n -1)³.

<prompt_2.1> Expand the cubes in the general term (2n)³ - (2n -1)³ and simplify the expression. </prompt_2.1>

So each term simplifies to 12n² - 6n + 1. Therefore, the entire sum is the sum from n=1 to 9 of (12n² - 6n + 1).
That seems manageable.

So total sum S = Σ(12n² -6n +1) from n=1 to 9.

Let's break this into three separate sums:

<prompt_2.2> Break the sum into three separate sums and simplify each term. </prompt_2.2>

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to compute this without expanding each term. Let's think.

<prompt_2.3> Explore alternative methods to compute the sum without expanding each term. </prompt_2.3>

Alternatively, using the formula for the sum of cubes: Σk³ = (n(n+1)/2)². But here we have alternating terms. Let's see.

<prompt_2.4> Use the formula for the sum of cubes to compute the alternating sum. </prompt_2.4>

<execution_2.1>
Using the formula a³ - b³ = (a - b)(a² + ab + b²).

Here, a = 2n, b = 2n -1. Then:

(2n)³ - (2n -1)³ = (2n - (2n -1)) * [(2n)² + (2n)(2n -1) + (2n -1)²]

Simplify the first part: 2n - (2n -1) = 1.

So each term becomes 1 * [(4n²) + (4n² - 2n) + (4n² -4n +1)]

Let me compute that:

First term inside the brackets: 4n²

Second term: 4n² - 2n

Third term: 4n² -4n +1

Add them together:

4n² + (4n² -2n) + (4n² -4n +1) = 4n² +4n² -2n +4n² -4n +1 = (4+4+4)n² + (-2n -4n) +1 = 12n² -6n +1
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
S = 12Σn² -6Σn + Σ1

We know formulas for these sums:

Σn² from 1 to m is m(m+1)(2m+1)/6

Σn from 1 to m is m(m+1)/2

Σ1 from 1 to m is m

Here, m=9. Let's compute each part.

First, 12Σn²: 12*(9*10*19)/6. Wait, let's compute step by step.

Σn² from 1 to 9: 9*10*19/6 = (9*10*19)/6. Let's compute that. 9/3=3, so 3*10*19/2 = (30*19)/2 = 570/2 = 285. So Σn² = 285. Then 12*285 = 3420.

Next term: -6Σn. Σn from 1 to9 is 9*10/2 =45. So -6*45 = -270.

Third term: Σ1 from 1 to9 is 9. So 9.

Therefore, total sum S = 3420 -270 +9 = 3420 -270 is 3150, plus 9 is 3159.

Another approach: The series is 2³ -1³ +4³ -3³ +6³ -5³ +... +18³ -17³. Let me write out all the terms:

2³, -1³, 4³, -3³, 6³, -5³, ...., 18³, -17³.

So if I list all the positive terms and all the negative terms separately:

Positive terms: 2³, 4³, 6³, ...., 18³. These are cubes of even numbers from 2 to 18.

Negative terms: -1³, -3³, -5³, ...., -17³. These are negative cubes of odd numbers from 1 to 17.

So the entire sum is (Σ even cubes) - (Σ odd cubes). Let's compute each sum separately.

First, compute the sum of cubes of even numbers from 2 to 18. Let's note that 2³ +4³ +6³ +... +18³. Let's factor out 2³: 8*(1³ +2³ +3³ +... +9³). Because 2=2*1, 4=2*2, ...., 18=2*9. So each term is (2k)³ =8k³ where k from 1 to 9. Therefore, the sum is 8*(1³ +2³ +... +9³).

Similarly, the sum of cubes of odd numbers from 1 to 17. Let's note that 1³ +3³ +5³ +... +17³. Let's see, how many terms? From 1 to 17 odd numbers: (17-1)/2 +1=9 terms. So 1³ +3³ +... +17³. There might be a formula for the sum of cubes of the first n odd numbers. Let me recall.

The sum of cubes of first n odd numbers is n²(2n² -1). Wait, let me check that. For n=1: 1³=1. Formula gives 1²(2*1² -1)=1*(2-1)=1. Correct. For n=2:1³ +3³=1+27=28. Formula: 2²(2*4 -1)=4*(8-1)=4*7=28. Correct. So yes, the formula is n²(2n² -1).
</execution_2.3>

<execution_2.4>
Let me consider the entire sum as sum_{k=1}^18 k³ - 2*sum_{k=1}^9 (2k-1)³. Wait, no. Wait, the original sum is 2³ -1³ +4³ -3³ +6³ -5³ +... +18³ -17³. So this is equivalent to (2³ +4³ +6³ +... +18³) - (1³ +3³ +5³ +... +17³). 

So the sum can be written as [sum of even cubes from 2 to 18] minus [sum of odd cubes from 1 to 17]. 

Let me compute both sums separately.

First, sum of even cubes from 2 to 18. Let's note that even numbers can be written as 2n where n=1 to 9. So sum_{n=1}^9 (2n)³ = 8*sum_{n=1}^9 n³. Similarly, the sum of odd cubes from 1 to 17. The odd numbers can be written as 2n-1 where n=1 to 9 (since 2*9 -1=17). So sum_{n=1}^9 (2n-1)³.

Therefore, the total sum S = 8*sum_{n=1}^9 n³ - sum_{n=1}^9 (2n-1)³.

But we can compute both sums.

First, compute sum_{n=1}^9 n³. The formula for the sum of cubes up to n is [n(n+1)/2]^2. So for n=9, sum = [9*10/2]^2 = [45]^2 = 2025. Therefore, 8*sum_{n=1}^9 n³ = 8*2025 = 16200.

Next, compute sum_{n=1}^9 (2n-1)³. Let's compute that. Let's expand (2n -1)³. Which is 8n³ - 12n² + 6n -1. Therefore, sum_{n=1}^9 (2n -1)³ = 8*sum n³ -12*sum n² +6*sum n -sum 1.

Compute each term:

sum n³ from 1 to9 is 2025 as before.

sum n² from 1 to9: formula is n(n+1)(2n+1)/6. For n=9: 9*10*19/6 = 285. So sum n² =285.

sum n from 1 to9: 9*10/2=45.

sum 1 from 1 to9:9.

Therefore, sum (2n -1)^3 =8*2025 -12*285 +6*45 -9.

Let's compute each part:

8*2025=16200

12*285=3420

6*45=270

So:

16200 -3420 +270 -9 = 16200 -3420 is 12780; 12780 +270 is 13050; 13050 -9=13041.

Therefore, sum (2n -1)^3=13041.

Therefore, the total sum S=16200 -13041=3159.

Wait, that's the same result as before. So both methods give 3159.

Based on execution_2.2:
Wait, let me check my calculations again because 3420 -270 +9.

<prompt_3.1> Verify the calculations for the sum S and identify any mistakes. </prompt_3.1>
-----

Based on execution_2.3:
Let me compute that.

Sum of even cubes: 8*2025=16200.

Sum of odd cubes:9²(2*9² -1)=81*(2*81 -1)=81*(162 -1)=81*161.

<prompt_3.2> Compute the sum of even cubes and odd cubes and verify the result. </prompt_3.2>

Wait, but let me verify that formula for the sum of cubes of first n odd numbers.
I think the formula is n²(2n² -1). Let me check for n=1:1²(2*1 -1)=1*(2-1)=1. Correct.

<prompt_3.3> Verify the formula for the sum of cubes of first n odd numbers and confirm the result. </prompt_3.3>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
12*285: 10*285=2850, 2*285=570, total 2850+570=3420. Correct.

-6*45: -270. Correct.

Σ1=9. So 3420 -270 is indeed 3150. 3150 +9=3159.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
Compute 81*161. Let's do 80*161 +1*161 =12880 +161=13041. So sum of odd cubes is 13041. Therefore, total sum S=16200 -13041=3159. Same result as before. So this confirms the answer is 3159.

But just to be thorough, let me compute the sum manually for smaller cases to check if the formula holds.

For example, take n=1: sum is 2³ -1³=8 -1=7. Using the formula: 12n² -6n +1=12*1 -6*1 +1=7. Correct.

For n=2: (2³ -1³)+(4³ -3³)=7 + (64 -27)=7 +37=44. Using the formula: 12(1² +2²) -6(1 +2) + (1 +1)=12(1+4) -6*3 +2=12*5 -18 +2=60 -18 +2=44. Correct.

Another check: n=3. The sum should be (2³ -1³)+(4³ -3³)+(6³ -5³)=7 +37 +91=135. Using the formula:12(1² +2² +3²) -6(1 +2 +3) +3=12(1+4+9) -6*6 +3=12*14 -36 +3=168 -36 +3=135. Correct.
</execution_3.2>

<execution_3.3>
For n=2:2²(2*4 -1)=4*(8 -1)=4*7=28. Which is 1³ +3³=1+27=28. Correct.

So for n=9, the sum is 9²(2*9² -1)=81*(2*81 -1)=81*(162 -1)=81*161.

Compute 81*161:

Compute 80*161=12880, and 1*161=161, so total 12880 +161=13041. Correct. So sum of odd cubes is 13041.

Therefore, the total sum S=16200 -13041=3159. Same result.

So both methods confirm that the sum is 3159. Therefore, the answer should be 3159.

Original expansion:

(2n)³ - (2n -1)³ = (2n - (2n -1))( (2n)^2 + (2n)(2n -1) + (2n -1)^2 )

=1*(4n² + (4n² -2n) + (4n² -4n +1))

=4n² +4n² -2n +4n² -4n +1

=12n² -6n +1. Correct.

Sum from 1 to 9: 12Σn² -6Σn +Σ1.

Σn²=285, Σn=45, Σ1=9.

12*285=3420, -6*45=-270, +9. 3420-270=3150, 3150+9=3159. Correct.

Yes, seems right.
