Okay, let's see. The problem is about two cities, A and B, which are 45 miles apart. Alicia lives in A and Beth lives in B. They both start biking towards each other at the same time. Alicia's speed is 18 miles per hour, and Beth's speed is 12 miles per hour. The question is asking how many miles from City A they will be when they meet.

First, I need to visualize the scenario. There are two cities, 45 miles apart. Alicia starts from A going towards B, and Beth starts from B going towards A. They bike towards each other, and we need to find the meeting point's distance from A.

Let me think about the basic concepts here. This is a relative speed problem, right? When two objects move towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds.

So, Alicia's speed is 18 mph, Beth's is 12 mph. Their combined speed towards each other would be 18 + 12 = 30 mph. That makes sense because they are moving towards each other, so the distance between them decreases at a rate of 30 miles per hour.

The total distance between the two cities is 45 miles. So, the time it takes for them to meet should be the total distance divided by their combined speed. Let me write that down:

Time = Total Distance / Relative Speed
Time = 45 miles / 30 mph = 1.5 hours

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
So, they will meet after 1.5 hours.

Now, the question is how many miles from City A they will be when they meet. To find this, I can calculate the distance Alicia has traveled in 1.5 hours. Since she's moving at 18 mph, the distance she covers is:

Distance from A = Alicia's speed × Time
Distance from A = 18 mph × 1.5 hours = 27 miles

Alternatively, I could calculate Beth's distance from B and subtract that from the total distance to find the distance from A. Let's check that method too.

<prompt_2.1> Calculate the distance from City A using both Alicia's speed and Beth's speed. </prompt_2.1>

Wait a second, let me verify this another way to ensure I didn't make a mistake.

Another way to approach this problem is to set up equations for their positions as functions of time and solve for when their positions are equal.

<prompt_2.2> Set up equations for their positions as functions of time and solve for when their positions are equal. </prompt_2.2>

Alternatively, if I didn't think in terms of relative speed, I could model their positions over time.

<prompt_2.3> Model their positions over time and solve for when their positions are equal. </prompt_2.3>

Alternatively, maybe breaking down the time into minutes. 1.5 hours is 90 minutes. So, in 90 minutes, Alicia travels 18 miles per hour.

<prompt_2.4> Break down the time into minutes and calculate the distance from City A. </prompt_2.4>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Beth's speed is 12 mph, so the distance she covers in 1.5 hours is:

Distance from B = Beth's speed × Time
Distance from B = 12 mph × 1.5 hours = 18 miles

Since the total distance between A and B is 45 miles, the distance from A when they meet would be 45 miles minus 18 miles, which is also 27 miles.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Let's denote the time they meet as t hours. Alicia's position from A after t hours is 18t miles. Beth's position from B after t hours is 12t miles. Since they meet, the sum of these distances should equal the total distance between the cities:

18t + 12t = 45
30t = 45
t = 45 / 30 = 1.5 hours
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
Let’s denote the time they travel until meeting as t hours. Then, the distance Alicia has covered is 18t miles, and the distance Beth has covered is 12t miles. Since they started 45 miles apart and are moving towards each other, the sum of the distances they've covered should equal the initial distance between them.

So, 18t + 12t = 45

Combining the terms gives 30t = 45

Solving for t: t = 45 / 30 = 1.5 hours. That's the same result as before.
</execution_2.3>

<execution_2.4>
In one hour, that's 18 miles. In 90 minutes, which is 1 hour and 30 minutes, she would go 18 miles + 9 miles (since 0.5 hours at 18 mph is 9 miles) = 27 miles. Same result.

Similarly, Beth is going 12 mph. In 1.5 hours, she would cover 12 * 1.5 = 18 miles. So, starting from B, she covers 18 miles towards A. Since the total distance is 45 miles, the meeting point is 45 - 18 = 27 miles from A. Same answer again.

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1, execution_2.2, execution_2.3, execution_2.4:
All methods lead to 27 miles from City A. That seems consistent. I don't see any errors in the reasoning.

<prompt_3.1> Reflect on the consistency of the solution and ensure no errors were made. </prompt_3.1>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
Let me think if there's any alternative interpretation of the problem. For example, could they meet at a different point? But since they start at the same time and move towards each other, their meeting point is uniquely determined by their speeds and the initial distance. The calculations all confirm that it's 27 miles from A.

<Final_answer>
Thus, the final answer is \boxed{27}.
