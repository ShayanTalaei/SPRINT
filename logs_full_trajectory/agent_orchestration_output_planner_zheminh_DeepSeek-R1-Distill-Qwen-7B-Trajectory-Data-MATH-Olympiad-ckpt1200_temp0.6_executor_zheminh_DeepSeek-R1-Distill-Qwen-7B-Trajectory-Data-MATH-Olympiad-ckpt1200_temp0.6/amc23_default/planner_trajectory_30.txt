For how many ordered pairs $(a,b)$ of integers does the polynomial $x^3+ax^2+bx+6$ have $3$ distinct integer roots?
</Question>

<think>
<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) of integers such that the polynomial x³ + a x² + b x + 6 has 3 distinct integer roots. Hmm, let's start by recalling some polynomial root theorems. 

First, if a cubic polynomial with integer coefficients has integer roots, then those roots must be divisors of the constant term. In this case, the constant term is 6. So the possible integer roots are the divisors of 6. Let me list them out: ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6. These are the candidates for the roots.

Since the polynomial has three distinct integer roots, let's denote them as r, s, and t. Then, according to Vieta's formulas, we can relate the coefficients a and b to the roots. Vieta's formulas for a cubic polynomial x³ + c x² + d x + e are:

<prompt_1.1> Using Vieta's formulas, express the coefficients a and b in terms of the roots r, s, and t, and write down the equations relating a, b to the roots. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
r + s + t = -c  
r s + r t + s t = d  
r s t = -e  

But in our polynomial, the coefficients are a, b, and 6. So translating that:

r + s + t = -a  
r s + r t + s t = b  
r s t = -6  

Wait, hold on. The polynomial is x³ + a x² + b x + 6. Comparing to the general form x³ + c x² + d x + e, we have c = a, d = b, and e = 6. So applying Vieta's formulas:

Sum of roots: r + s + t = -a  
Sum of products two at a time: r s + r t + s t = b  
Product of roots: r s t = -6  

Wait, that's important. The product of the roots is -6. But since the roots are integers, their product must be -6. So we need to find all ordered triples of distinct integers (r, s, t) such that r * s * t = -6. Then, for each such triple, compute a = -(r + s + t) and b = r s + r t + s t, and count the distinct ordered pairs (a, b).

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
So the first step is to list all possible triples of distinct integers whose product is -6.

<prompt_2.1> List all possible triples of distinct integers (r, s, t) such that their product is -6. </prompt_2.1>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Let me think. Since the product is -6, the roots can be positive or negative. Let's consider all possible factorizations of 6 into three distinct integers, considering both positive and negative possibilities.

First, let's factor 6 into three integers. The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. So the possible divisors are ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6. Since we need three distinct integers, we need to choose three different numbers from these divisors such that their product is -6.

Let me list all possible combinations. Let's start by considering the positive divisors first, then account for the negative sign.

The positive divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6. We need three distinct numbers from these. However, 1*2*3 = 6, which is positive. If we take one negative number, then the product becomes negative. So possible triples with one negative number:

For example:

-1, 2, 3: product is -6  
-2, 1, 3: product is -6  
-3, 1, 2: product is -6  
-6, 1, 1: but 1 is repeated, so invalid  
-6, 1, -1: product is 6, which is positive  
Wait, maybe I need a systematic approach.

Let me consider all possible triples (r, s, t) where r < s < t (to avoid permutations) and r * s * t = -6. Then, I can count the permutations later.

But since the roots can be in any order, but for the purpose of finding a and b, the order doesn't matter because Vieta's formulas depend only on the sum and products, which are symmetric. However, since the problem asks for ordered pairs (a, b), we need to consider all possible distinct triples, even if they are permutations of each other, because different permutations might lead to different a and b? Wait, no. Wait, if two triples are permutations of each other, then their sums and products will be the same, so a and b would be the same. Therefore, even if the roots are permutations, the coefficients a and b would be the same. Therefore, the ordered pair (a, b) is determined uniquely by the multiset of roots, not their order. Therefore, we can consider unordered triples, compute a and b, and then count each unique (a, b) once. However, the problem states "ordered pairs (a, b)", so if different triples lead to the same a and b, they are considered the same ordered pair. Therefore, we need to count distinct (a, b) pairs, regardless of how many triples produce them.

Wait, but perhaps different triples can lead to the same a and b. So perhaps we need to first generate all possible triples (r, s, t) with distinct integer roots, compute a and b for each, and then count the unique pairs.

But given that the roots are distinct integers, and the product is -6, let's first find all possible triples (r, s, t) with distinct integers such that r * s * t = -6. Then, for each such triple, compute a = -(r + s + t) and b = rs + rt + st, and collect all unique (a, b) pairs.

So first, let's find all possible such triples. Let's start by listing all possible factorizations.

Since the product is -6, which is -1 * 6, 1 * -6, etc. Let's consider all possible triplets of distinct integers whose product is -6.

First, note that the absolute value of the product is 6, so the absolute values of the roots must multiply to 6. The possible absolute values are 1, 2, 3, 6.

So the possible combinations of absolute values (|r|, |s|, |t|) such that their product is 6. Since they are distinct, the possible combinations (up to permutation) are:

1, 1, 6 – but duplicates, invalid  
1, 2, 3 – product 6, distinct  
2, 3, 1 – same as above  
6, 1, 1 – duplicates, invalid  
So the only possible combination with distinct absolute values is 1, 2, 3. Therefore, the absolute values of the roots must be 1, 2, 3. Then, the signs can be arranged such that the product is -6.

So the roots are ±1, ±2, ±3. But their product must be -6. Let's consider all possible sign combinations.

The product of the roots is -6. Let's denote the number of negative roots. If there are an odd number of negative roots, the product will be negative. Since 6 is positive, so if we have an odd number of negative roots, the product will be negative, which is what we need. So possible cases:

Case 1: One negative root, two positive roots. Then the product is negative. The absolute values are 1, 2, 3.

Case 2: Three negative roots. Then the product is negative (since -1 * -1 * -1 = -1). But the absolute values would be 1, 2, 3, so the product is -6. Wait, 1*2*3=6, so if all three are negative, the product is -6. So that's another case.

Wait, let's check:

If all three roots are negative: (-1)*(-2)*(-3) = -6. So yes, that's another possible triple.

Similarly, if we have one negative and two positives:

For example: -1, 2, 3: product is -6  
1, -2, 3: product is -6  
1, 2, -3: product is -6  
-1, -2, 3: product is 6 (positive)  
-1, -2, -3: product is -6  
-1, 2, -3: product is 6 (positive)  
1, -2, -3: product is 6 (positive)  

Wait, so let's list all possible triples with distinct integers whose product is -6:

First, the case where one root is negative and two are positive:

Possible roots: -1, 2, 3  
-1, 1, -2, 3 – Wait, no, we need exactly one negative and two positive. Wait, the roots are distinct, so we have to choose one negative and two positive numbers from the divisors.

But the divisors are 1, 2, 3, 6, -1, -2, -3, -6. But since the absolute values have to be 1, 2, 3 (as we saw earlier), because 6 is too big. Wait, no, actually, 6 is a divisor of 6, so maybe we can have 6 as a root. Wait, but if one root is 6, then the other two roots must multiply to -6/6 = -1. But then the other two roots must multiply to -1. The integer divisors of -1 are 1 and -1. So possible roots: 6, 1, -1. Let's check: 6*1*(-1) = -6. So that's another possible triple.

Similarly, if one root is 3, then the other two roots must multiply to -6/3 = -2. The integer divisors of -2 are 1, -1, 2, -2. So possible pairs: (1, -2), (-1, 2). So possible triples: 3, 1, -2; 3, -1, 2. Let's check: 3*1*(-2) = -6; 3*(-1)*2 = -6. So those are valid.

Similarly, if one root is 2, then the other two roots must multiply to -6/2 = -3. The integer divisors of -3 are 1, -1, 3, -3. So possible pairs: (1, -3), (-1, 3). So possible triples: 2, 1, -3; 2, -1, 3. Check: 2*1*(-3) = -6; 2*(-1)*3 = -6.

Similarly, if one root is -1, then the other two roots must multiply to -6/(-1) = 6. The integer divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6 and their negatives. So possible pairs: (1, 6), (2, 3), (-1, -6), (-2, -3). But since the roots must be distinct, and one root is -1, the other two can't be -1. So possible triples: -1, 1, 6; -1, 2, 3; -1, -6, -1 (invalid), -1, -2, -3 (product is -6). Wait, let's check:

-1, 1, 6: product is (-1)*1*6 = -6  
-1, 2, 3: product is -6 (as before)  
-1, -2, -3: product is (-1)*(-2)*(-3) = -6  
But wait, we already considered -1, 2, 3 and -1, -2, -3 earlier? Wait, no, earlier we considered triples with one negative and two positives, but here, if we take -1, -2, -3, that's three negatives. Let me check if that's allowed.

Wait, the product of -1, -2, -3 is (-1)*(-2)*(-3) = -6. So that's another triple. So that's a triple with three negative roots. So in addition to the triples with one negative and two positives, we also have triples with three negatives.

Similarly, if we take -6, 1, 1: but 1 is repeated, invalid. So maybe the possible triples are:

Triples with one negative and two positives: 

-1, 2, 3  
-2, 1, 3  
-3, 1, 2  
-1, 1, -6: product is 6, invalid  
-1, 2, -3: product is 6, invalid  
-1, -2, 3: product is 6, invalid  
-1, -3, 2: product is 6, invalid  
-2, -1, 3: product is 6, invalid  
-2, -3, 1: product is 6, invalid  
-3, -1, 2: product is 6, invalid  
-3, -2, 1: product is 6, invalid  

Wait, perhaps I need a better approach. Let's list all possible triples with distinct integers where the product is -6. Let's list them systematically.

First, consider all possible triplets of distinct integers (positive and negative) such that their product is -6.

Start with the absolute values. Since 6 factors into 1*2*3, the absolute values of the roots must be 1, 2, 3. So the roots can be any combination of these numbers with signs, such that the product is -6.

So the possible combinations are:

1, 2, 3 with an odd number of negatives: 1 negative, 2 positives or 3 negatives.

But 1, 2, 3 is three positive numbers. So if we take one negative and two positives, the product is negative. If we take three negatives, the product is negative (since -1*-2*-3 = -6). So both cases are possible.

So the possible triples are:

1. (-1, 2, 3)
2. (1, -2, 3)
3. (1, 2, -3)
4. (-1, -2, -3)

Additionally, are there other triples with different absolute values? For example, if one root is 6, then the other two roots must multiply to -6/6 = -1. So possible roots: 6, 1, -1. Product is -6. Similarly, 6, -1, 1. But 1 and -1 are already considered in the above cases? Wait, no. Wait, 6 is a different absolute value, so that's another case.

So let's check:

If one root is 6, then the other two must multiply to -1. The integer pairs that multiply to -1 are (1, -1). So possible triples:

5. (6, 1, -1)
6. (6, -1, 1)

Similarly, if one root is -6, then the other two must multiply to -6/(-6) = 1. The integer pairs that multiply to 1 are (1, 1) and (-1, -1). But since the roots must be distinct, we can't have (1, 1) or (-1, -1). Therefore, there are no valid triples with -6 as a root because the other two roots would have to be the same. So those are invalid. Similarly, 2 and 3: if one root is 2, then the other two must multiply to -3. The pairs are (1, -3), (-1, 3). So triples:

7. (2, 1, -3)
8. (2, -1, 3)

Similarly, if one root is 3, then the other two must multiply to -2. The pairs are (1, -2), (-1, 2). So triples:

9. (3, 1, -2)
10. (3, -1, 2)

Wait, but these are similar to the ones we already considered earlier. So perhaps we need to list all possible triples with distinct integers such that their product is -6. Let's try to list all possible combinations.

First, the triples with absolute values 1, 2, 3:

Case 1: One negative, two positives.

Possible permutations:

-1, 2, 3  
1, -2, 3  
1, 2, -3  
-1, -2, -3 (three negatives)

But wait, the three negatives: (-1)*(-2)*(-3) = -6, which is correct.

Then, other cases where the absolute values include 6:

Case 2: Absolute values 1, 1, 6 (but duplicates, invalid)  
Case 3: Absolute values 2, 3, 1 (same as above)  
Case 4: Absolute values 6, 1, 1 (invalid)  
Case 5: Absolute values 6, 2, -1 (but 6*2*(-1) = -12 ≠ -6)  
Wait, no. If one root is 6, then the other two must multiply to -1. So roots: 6, 1, -1. Similarly, 6, -1, 1. Let's check:

6*1*(-1) = -6. So that's valid. Similarly, if one root is -6, then the other two must multiply to 1, but as we saw, that's not possible with distinct integers. So those are the only ones with 6.

So now, let's list all possible triples:

From absolute values 1, 2, 3:

1. (-1, 2, 3)
2. (1, -2, 3)
3. (1, 2, -3)
4. (-1, -2, -3)

From absolute values 6, 1, -1:

5. (6, 1, -1)
6. (6, -1, 1)

Wait, but 6, -1, 1 is the same as 6, 1, -1, just reordered. Similarly, are there other permutations?

Wait, if we take absolute values 6, 2, -3: 6*2*(-3) = -36 ≠ -6. So that's not valid. Similarly, 6, 3, -2: 6*3*(-2) = -36 ≠ -6. So those don't work.

Alternatively, if we take absolute values 6, 1, 1: duplicates, invalid. 6, 2, 3: 6*2*3 = 36 ≠ -6. So that's not valid.

So only the triples with absolute values 1,2,3 and 6,1,-1 are valid. So total of 6 triples:

1. (-1, 2, 3)
2. (1, -2, 3)
3. (1, 2, -3)
4. (-1, -2, -3)
5. (6, 1, -1)
6. (-6, 1, 1) – but this is invalid because of duplicates.

Wait, no. Wait, if we take -6 as a root, then the other two roots must multiply to 1. But to get 1, we need (1,1) or (-1,-1), which are duplicates. Therefore, -6 cannot be a root because the other two roots would have to repeat. Therefore, the only valid triples with 6 or -6 are those with 6 and -1 and 1. So triples 5 and 6, but 6 is (6,1,-1) and (-6,1,1) is invalid. So only 5 and 6? Wait, no. Wait, if we take -6 as a root, then the other two roots must multiply to 1. So possible roots are -6, 1, 1 or -6, -1, -1. But duplicates are not allowed, so those are invalid. Therefore, no triples with -6. Similarly, 6 can be a root with 1 and -1. So the only valid triples are the ones above.

Wait, but let's check:

If we have a root of 6, then the other two roots must multiply to -6/6 = -1. So the pairs are (1, -1). So the triples are (6, 1, -1) and (6, -1, 1). But these are the same as (6, 1, -1) and (-1, 1, 6), etc. So these are essentially the same as the triple (6,1,-1). So in terms of ordered triples, these are different permutations, but since the roots are distinct, each permutation is a different ordered triple.

But in terms of Vieta's formulas, the sum and product are the same regardless of the order. So for the purpose of computing a and b, the order doesn't matter. Therefore, even though (6,1,-1), (6,-1,1), (1,6,-1), etc., are different ordered triples, they all result in the same a and b. Therefore, we need to consider them as the same triple for the purpose of a and b.

Therefore, the distinct triples (up to permutation) are:

1. (-1, 2, 3)
2. (1, -2, 3)
3. (1, 2, -3)
4. (-1, -2, -3)
5. (6, 1, -1)

But wait, is (6,1,-1) different from the others? Let's check:

For (6,1,-1), the roots are 6, 1, -1. Their product is 6*1*(-1) = -6. The sum is 6 + 1 + (-1) = 6. The sum of products two at a time: 6*1 + 6*(-1) + 1*(-1) = 6 -6 -1 = -1. So a = -6, b = -1.

For (-1, 2, 3): sum is -1 + 2 + 3 = 4. Sum of products: (-1)(2) + (-1)(3) + 2*3 = -2 -3 +6 = 1. So a = -4, b = 1.

For (1, -2, 3): sum is 1 -2 +3 = 2. Sum of products: 1*(-2) + 1*3 + (-2)*3 = -2 +3 -6 = -5. So a = -2, b = -5.

For (1, 2, -3): sum is 1 +2 -3 = 0. Sum of products: 1*2 +1*(-3) +2*(-3) = 2 -3 -6 = -7. So a = 0, b = -7.

For (-1, -2, -3): sum is -1 -2 -3 = -6. Sum of products: (-1)(-2) + (-1)(-3) + (-2)(-3) = 2 +3 +6 = 11. So a = 6, b =11.

So these are five distinct triples, each leading to different (a, b) pairs. However, we need to check if there are any other triples that we might have missed.

Wait, let's think again. Are there other triples with distinct integers whose product is -6?

For example, could we have roots like 2, 3, -1? That's the same as (1, 2, -3) just reordered. So same as the third case. Similarly, 3, -1, 2 is same as (1, -2, 3). So those are already considered.

Alternatively, could we have roots like -6, 1, 1? But duplicates are not allowed. Similarly, 6, -1, 1 is allowed but duplicates are not. Wait, 6,1,-1: distinct, as 6,1,-1 are all different. So that's allowed.

Wait, but let's check if there are other possible triples. For example, 3, -2, 1: same as (1, -2, 3). So same as case 2.

Alternatively, 2, -3, 1: same as (1, -2, 3). So same as case 2.

Alternatively, -1, 6, 1: same as (6,1,-1). So same as case 5.

Alternatively, -1, 1, 6: same as (6,1,-1). So same as case 5.

Therefore, the five triples above are the only distinct ones. Wait, but let me check another possibility. Suppose we have roots like 3, -2, 1: same as (1, -2, 3). So same as case 2.

Alternatively, 3, -1, 2: same as (1, 2, -3). So same as case 3.

Alternatively, -3, 2, 1: same as (1, 2, -3). So same as case 3.

Alternatively, -2, 3, 1: same as (1, -2, 3). So same as case 2.

Alternatively, -3, 1, 2: same as (1, 2, -3). So same as case 3.

Alternatively, -1, 3, 2: same as (1, 2, -3). So same as case 3.

So all permutations of these triples lead to the same (a, b). Therefore, the five triples are:

1. (-1, 2, 3) leading to a = -4, b = 1  
2. (1, -2, 3) leading to a = -2, b = -5  
3. (1, 2, -3) leading to a = 0, b = -7  
4. (-1, -2, -3) leading to a = 6, b = 11  
5. (6, 1, -1) leading to a = -6, b = -1  

Wait, but let's confirm the last one. For (6,1,-1):

Sum: 6 + 1 + (-1) = 6. So a = -6.  
Sum of products: 6*1 + 6*(-1) + 1*(-1) = 6 -6 -1 = -1. So b = -1. Correct.

So these are five distinct triples. But let's check if there are any other possible triples. For example, could we have roots like 2, -3, 1? But that's same as (1, -2, 3). So same as case 2.

Alternatively, 3, -1, 2: same as (1, 2, -3). So same as case 3.

Alternatively, -6, 1, 1: invalid.  
-6, -1, 1: invalid.  
6, -1, -1: invalid.  

So no other triples. Therefore, there are five distinct ordered triples of roots, leading to five distinct (a, b) pairs. But wait, let's check if the (6,1,-1) triple is distinct from the others. Yes, because its roots are different from the others.

But let's check if there are any other possible triples. For example, could we have roots like 3, -2, 1? That's same as (1, -2, 3). So same as case 2. Similarly, 2, -3, 1: same as (1, 2, -3). So same as case 3. So no new triples.

Therefore, the five triples are the only ones. However, let's check if there are any other triples with different absolute values. For example, roots like 6, 2, -1: product is 6*2*(-1) = -12 ≠ -6. So invalid. Similarly, 6, 3, -1: 6*3*(-1) = -18 ≠ -6. So invalid. So only the triples with absolute values 1,2,3 and 6,1,-1 are valid.

Therefore, the five triples are:

1. (-1, 2, 3) => a = -4, b = 1  
2. (1, -2, 3) => a = -2, b = -5  
3. (1, 2, -3) => a = 0, b = -7  
4. (-1, -2, -3) => a = 6, b = 11  
5. (6, 1, -1) => a = -6, b = -1  

But wait, let's check if there are any other possible triples. For example, roots like 3, -2, 1: same as (1, -2, 3). So same as case 2.

Alternatively, 2, -3, 1: same as (1, 2, -3). So same as case 3.

Alternatively, -3, 2, 1: same as (1, 2, -3). So same as case 3.

Alternatively, -2, 3, 1: same as (1, -2, 3). So same as case 2.

Alternatively, 3, -1, 2: same as (1, 2, -3). So same as case 3.

Alternatively, -1, 3, 2: same as (1, 2, -3). So same as case 3.

Alternatively, -1, 6, 1: same as (6,1,-1). So same as case 5.

Alternatively, 6, -1, 1: same as (6,1,-1). So same as case 5.

So all permutations of these triples lead to the same (a, b) pairs. Therefore, the five triples correspond to five distinct (a, b) pairs.

Wait, but let me check again. The triple (-1, -2, -3) gives a = 6, b = 11. Is there another triple with three negative roots that gives a different (a, b)?

For example, if we take roots -1, -2, -3: sum is -6, sum of products is 11. If we take roots -1, -4, 1.5: but 1.5 is not integer. So no. So only the triple (-1, -2, -3) works. So that's one pair.

Similarly, the triple (6,1,-1) gives a = -6, b = -1. Are there any other triples with one 6 and two numbers multiplying to -1? The only way is 6, 1, -1. So that's the only one.

Therefore, the five triples are the only possible ones. Therefore, there are five ordered pairs (a, b). But wait, let me check again.

Wait, but let's list all possible ordered triples (r, s, t) with distinct integers such that r*s*t = -6. Let's see:

1. (-1, 2, 3)  
2. (-1, 3, 2)  
3. (2, -1, 3)  
4. (2, 3, -1)  
5. (3, -1, 2)  
6. (3, 2, -1)  
7. (1, -2, 3)  
8. (1, 3, -2)  
9. (-2, 1, 3)  
10. (-2, 3, 1)  
11. (3, 1, -2)  
12. (3, -2, 1)  
13. (1, 2, -3)  
14. (1, -3, 2)  
15. (2, 1, -3)  
16. (2, -3, 1)  
17. (-3, 1, 2)  
18. (-3, 2, 1)  
19. (-1, -2, -3)  
20. (-1, -3, -2)  
21. (-2, -1, -3)  
22. (-2, -3, -1)  
23. (-3, -1, -2)  
24. (-3, -2, -1)  
25. (6, 1, -1)  
26. (6, -1, 1)  
27. (1, 6, -1)  
28. (1, -1, 6)  
29. (-1, 6, 1)  
30. (-1, 1, 6)  

But many of these are duplicates in terms of the set of roots, just ordered differently. For example, (1, -2, 3) and (-1, 2, 3) are different ordered triples but same set. Since the problem asks for ordered pairs (a, b), but the coefficients a and b depend only on the multiset of roots, not their order. Therefore, even though the ordered triples are different, they lead to the same (a, b). Therefore, the distinct ordered pairs (a, b) are determined by the distinct multisets of roots.

Therefore, the distinct multisets are:

1. {-1, 2, 3}  
2. {1, -2, 3}  
3. {1, 2, -3}  
4. {-1, -2, -3}  
5. {6, 1, -1}  

These are five distinct multisets, each leading to a unique (a, b) pair. Therefore, there are 5 such ordered pairs.

Wait, but let me check if there are any other multisets. For example, is there a multiset like {2, 3, -1}? That's same as {1, -2, 3} if we reorder. So no, same multiset.

Alternatively, {3, -2, 1}: same as {1, -2, 3}. So same multiset. So all these are covered in the five above.

Therefore, the answer should be 5.

But wait, let me check again. Let's compute all possible (a, b) pairs from the five multisets:

1. {-1, 2, 3}:  
Sum: -1 + 2 + 3 = 4 => a = -4  
Sum of products: (-1)(2) + (-1)(3) + 2*3 = -2 -3 +6 = 1 => b = 1  
Pair: (-4, 1)

2. {1, -2, 3}:  
Sum: 1 -2 +3 = 2 => a = -2  
Sum of products: (1)(-2) + (1)(3) + (-2)(3) = -2 +3 -6 = -5 => b = -5  
Pair: (-2, -5)

3. {1, 2, -3}:  
Sum: 1 +2 -3 = 0 => a = 0  
Sum of products: (1)(2) + (1)(-3) + (2)(-3) = 2 -3 -6 = -7 => b = -7  
Pair: (0, -7)

4. {-1, -2, -3}:  
Sum: -1 -2 -3 = -6 => a = 6  
Sum of products: (-1)(-2) + (-1)(-3) + (-2)(-3) = 2 +3 +6 = 11 => b = 11  
Pair: (6, 11)

5. {6, 1, -1}:  
Sum: 6 +1 -1 = 6 => a = -6  
Sum of products: 6*1 + 6*(-1) + 1*(-1) = 6 -6 -1 = -1 => b = -1  
Pair: (-6, -1)

These are five distinct ordered pairs. Therefore, the number of ordered pairs (a, b) is 5.

Wait, but let me check again if there are any other possible triples. For example, could there be a triple with roots like 2, -3, 1? That's same as {1, -2, 3}, which we already have. So no new pairs. Similarly, other combinations lead to the same pairs.

Therefore, the answer is 5.

But wait, let me check if I missed any other possible triples. For example, are there any other triples with distinct integers whose product is -6? Let's see:

Suppose one root is 6, another is 2, and the third is -1: 6*2*(-1) = -12 ≠ -6. So invalid.  
If one root is 6, another is 3, and the third is -1: 6*3*(-1) = -18 ≠ -6.  
If one root is 6, another is 1, and the third is -1: 6*1*(-1) = -6. So that's valid, which we already considered.  
If one root is 4, then the other two roots must multiply to -6/4 = -1.5, which is not integer.  
Similarly, root 5: other two roots must multiply to -6/5 = -1.2, invalid.  
Root 7: -6/7, invalid.  
Similarly, negative roots: -4 would require others to multiply to 1.5, invalid.  
-5: others would multiply to 1.2, invalid.  
-7: others would multiply to 0.857, invalid.  
So no other integer roots possible. Therefore, the only possible triples are the five we found.

Therefore, the number of ordered pairs (a, b) is 5.
