Okay, let's see. I need to find the value of x + y given that x and y are positive real numbers satisfying two equations: y³ = x² and (y - x)² = 4y². Hmm. Alright, let me start by writing down the equations again to make sure I have them right.

First equation: y³ = x². So, that relates y and x in a cubic and square relationship. Second equation: (y - x)² = 4y². That seems like it can be expanded or maybe simplified to find a relation between x and y.

Let me start with the second equation because it might be easier to handle. Expanding (y - x)² gives y² - 2xy + x². According to the equation, this equals 4y².

So, substituting the expansion into the equation:

y² - 2xy + x² = 4y²

Let me rearrange terms to bring everything to one side:

y² - 2xy + x² - 4y² = 0

Combine like terms:

-3y² - 2xy + x² = 0

Hmm, that's a quadratic in terms of x or y. Maybe I can express one variable in terms of the other. Let's see.

Based on execution_1.1:
Alternatively, since we already have y³ = x² from the first equation, maybe we can express x in terms of y. Let's try that.

<prompt_2.1> Express x in terms of y using the first equation y³ = x², and substitute this into the simplified second equation. </prompt_2.1>

Wait, let me check if there are any other possible solutions. For example, when I solved for z, I had z = 3y or z = -y. But since z = x + y, and x and y are positive real numbers, z must be positive. So, z = -y would give a negative value, which is impossible because both x and y are positive. Therefore, z = 3y is the only valid solution.

Alternatively, maybe I can approach the problem differently. Let's try substituting x from the first equation into the second equation.

From y³ = x², we can write x = y^(3/2). Alternatively, x² = y³. Maybe substituting x² into the equation we just derived.

Wait, in the second equation after simplifying, we had:

-3y² - 2xy + x² = 0

But since x² = y³, substitute that into the equation:

-3y² - 2xy + y³ = 0

Hmm, that might be useful. Let's write that:

y³ - 3y² - 2xy = 0

But we still have an x term here. Since we know x in terms of y from the first equation, maybe substitute x = y^(3/2) into this equation.

Let's try that. Substitute x = y^(3/2) into y³ - 3y² - 2xy = 0:

y³ - 3y² - 2 * y^(3/2) * y = 0

Simplify the terms:

First term: y³

Second term: -3y²

Third term: -2 * y^(3/2) * y = -2 * y^(5/2)

So, the equation becomes:

y³ - 3y² - 2y^(5/2) = 0

Hmm, this is a bit complicated. Maybe factor out a y²:

y²(y - 3 - 2y^(1/2)) = 0

Since y is a positive real number, y² can't be zero, so we have:

y - 3 - 2y^(1/2) = 0

Let me rearrange this:

y - 2y^(1/2) - 3 = 0

This looks like a quadratic in terms of y^(1/2). Let me set t = y^(1/2), so y = t². Then substituting into the equation:

t² - 2t - 3 = 0

Now, this is a quadratic equation in t. Let's solve it:

t² - 2t - 3 = 0

Using the quadratic formula:

t = [2 ± √(4 + 12)] / 2 = [2 ± √16]/2 = [2 ± 4]/2

So, t = (2 + 4)/2 = 6/2 = 3, or t = (2 - 4)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1

But t = y^(1/2) is a square root of y, which must be positive. Therefore, t = -1 is invalid. So, t = 3.

<execution_2.2>
From the first equation, x² = y³, so x = y^(3/2) since x is positive. Let's plug this into the second equation:

(y - x)² = 4y²

Substituting x = y^(3/2):

(y - y^(3/2))² = 4y²

Let me expand the left side:

[y - y^(3/2)]² = y² - 2y * y^(3/2) + (y^(3/2))²

Simplify each term:

First term: y²

Second term: -2y * y^(3/2) = -2y^(1 + 3/2) = -2y^(5/2)

Third term: (y^(3/2))² = y^(3)

So, putting it all together:

y² - 2y^(5/2) + y³ = 4y²

Bring all terms to one side:

y³ - 2y^(5/2) + y² - 4y² = 0

Simplify the y² terms:

y³ - 2y^(5/2) - 3y² = 0

Factor out y²:

y²(y - 2y^(1/2) - 3) = 0

Since y is positive, y² ≠ 0. Therefore, the equation inside the parentheses must be zero:

y - 2y^(1/2) - 3 = 0

Let me set z = y^(1/2), so that y = z². Substitute into the equation:

z² - 2z - 3 = 0

This is a quadratic in z. Let's solve it:

z = [2 ± sqrt(4 + 12)] / 2 = [2 ± sqrt(16)] / 2 = [2 ± 4]/2

So, z = (2 + 4)/2 = 6/2 = 3 or z = (2 - 4)/2 = -2/2 = -1

Since z = y^(1/2) and y is positive, z must be positive. So, z = 3. Therefore, y = z² = 9. Then, x = y^(3/2) = 9^(3/2) = (sqrt(9))^3 = 3³ = 27. So, x + y = 27 + 9 = 36.

Based on execution_2.1:
Now, since t = y^(1/2) = 3, then y = t² = 9.
-----

Based on execution_2.2:
So, that's the same answer as before. Therefore, regardless of the method, x + y = 36.
Therefore, the answer is 36.

Based on execution_2.1:
Wait, let me verify this with the original equations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

<prompt_3.1> Verify the solution x = 27 and y = 9 by checking both original equations. </prompt_3.1>
-----

Based on execution_2.2:
But let me check if there are other possible solutions. For instance, when we set t = y^(1/2), we got t = 3 and t = -1, but t can't be negative. So, only t = 3 is valid. Therefore, only y = 9 is the solution.

Alternatively, suppose I didn't substitute x in terms of y. Let's see if there's another approach.

<prompt_3.2> Consider alternative methods to solve the problem and confirm the solution. </prompt_3.2>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
First equation: y³ = x². If y = 9, then y³ = 729, and x² = 27² = 729, so that checks out.

Second equation: (y - x)² = 4y². Let's compute (9 - 27)² = (-18)² = 324. On the other side, 4y² = 4*81 = 324. So that also checks out.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
From the first equation, x² = y³. From the second equation, (y - x)² = 4y². Let's try to manipulate these equations.

From the second equation: (y - x)² = 4y². Taking square roots on both sides, we get y - x = ±2y. But since x and y are positive, let's consider both cases.

Case 1: y - x = 2y

Then, subtract y from both sides: -x = y

But x and y are positive, so this would imply x = -y, which is impossible because x and y are positive. Therefore, this case is invalid.

Case 2: y - x = -2y

Then, y - x = -2y

Adding x to both sides: y = -2y + x

Adding 2y to both sides: 3y = x

So, x = 3y.

Wait, this is different from the previous result. Earlier, we found x = 27 when y = 9, which would make x = 3y = 27. Wait, 3y would be 3*9=27, which matches. So, this seems consistent. So, x = 3y.
</execution_3.2>

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.2:
Let's use this relation. From x = 3y, substitute into the first equation y³ = x².

<prompt_4.1> Substitute x = 3y into the first equation and solve for y. </prompt_4.1>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
So, y³ = (3y)² = 9y²

Thus, y³ = 9y²

Divide both sides by y² (since y ≠ 0):

y = 9

Then, x = 3y = 27. So, x + y = 27 + 9 = 36.
</execution_4.1>
</Execution_4>

<Plan_5>
Based on execution_4.1:
But wait, this seems straightforward. Let me just confirm that this method is valid. When we took the square root of both sides of (y - x)² = 4y², we considered both positive and negative roots.

<prompt_5.1> Re-evaluate the square root method to ensure all solutions are considered and confirm the solution. </prompt_5.1>
</Plan_5>

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
But in the case where we have (y - x)² = (2y)², then |y - x| = 2y. Since y and x are positive, y - x could be positive or negative. But since we ended up with x = 3y, which is positive, and y is positive, so x = 3y is valid. The other case y - x = -2y leads to x = 3y, which is the same as the other case. Wait, no. Wait, if y - x = -2y, then x = 3y. So, both cases lead to x = 3y. So, actually, there's only one valid solution here, which is x = 3y. Therefore, substituting back into the first equation gives y = 9, x = 27. Therefore, x + y = 36.

Therefore, both methods lead to the same answer. Therefore, the answer is 36.

<execution_6.1>
First, starting with the two given equations. The second equation was expanded and simplified to a quadratic in terms of x and y. Then, using the first equation to substitute x in terms of y, which led to a quadratic in terms of y^(1/2). Solving that gave y = 9, then x = 27. Alternatively, solving the second equation by taking square roots and considering the positive case, leading to x = 3y, which then substituted into the first equation gave y = 9 and x = 27. Both methods confirm the same answer. Checked the solution in both original equations, and they hold true. Therefore, the answer is 36.
