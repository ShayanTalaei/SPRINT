<Question>
Carlos went to a sports store to buy running shoes. Running shoes were on sale, with prices reduced by $20\%$ on every pair of shoes. Carlos also knew that he had to pay a $7.5\%$ sales tax on the discounted price. He had $$43$ dollars. What is the original (before discount) price of the most expensive shoes he could afford to buy?

Okay, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. So Carlos wants to buy running shoes that are on sale with a 20% discount, and then there's a 7.5% sales tax on the discounted price. He has $43. We need to find the original price of the most expensive shoes he can afford. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, let me recall how discounts and taxes work. If something is discounted by 20%, that means the customer pays 80% of the original price, right? Because 100% minus 20% is 80%. Then, the sales tax is 7.5% on the discounted price. So after the discount, we calculate the tax on that new amount and add it to get the final price Carlos has to pay.

So let's denote the original price as P. The discounted price would be P minus 20% of P, which is P * (1 - 0.20) = 0.80P. Then, the sales tax is 7.5% of the discounted price, so the tax amount is 0.075 * 0.80P. Therefore, the total price Carlos has to pay is the discounted price plus the tax: 0.80P + 0.075 * 0.80P.

Alternatively, we can factor out the 0.80P: total price = 0.80P * (1 + 0.075) = 0.80P * 1.075. Let me calculate 0.80 * 1.075.

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute the total multiplier first. Let's see:

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
0.80 * 1.075. Let me compute that. 0.80 times 1 is 0.80, and 0.80 times 0.075 is 0.06. So adding those together: 0.80 + 0.06 = 0.86. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 0.075 is 7.5%, so 0.80 * 0.075. Let me compute that again. 0.80 * 0.075. 0.8 * 0.07 is 0.056, and 0.8 * 0.005 is 0.004. So adding those gives 0.056 + 0.004 = 0.06. So total multiplier is 0.80 + 0.06 = 0.86. So the total price Carlos pays is 0.86P.

Based on execution_1.1:
Wait, that seems low. Wait, 20% discount and then 7.5% tax. Let me check with an example. Suppose the original price is $100.

<prompt_2.1> Verify the total multiplier calculation using a specific example. </prompt_2.1>

So Carlos has $43. Therefore, 0.86P = 43. To find P, divide both sides by 0.86: P = 43 / 0.86.

Let me compute that. 43 divided by 0.86.

<prompt_2.2> Calculate the original price using the total multiplier and Carlos's available money. </prompt_2.2>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
After 20% discount, the price is $80. Then, 7.5% tax on $80 is 0.075*80 = $6. So total price is $80 + $6 = $86. So 100 becomes 86. So yes, 0.86 of the original price. So that's correct.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
First, 0.86 times 50 is 43, right? Because 0.86 * 100 = 86, so 0.86 * 50 = 43. So P = 50. So the original price would be $50.
</execution_2.2>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.2:
Wait, but let me verify. If the original price is $50, then 20% discount is $10, so discounted price is $40. Then 7.5% tax on $40 is 0.075*40 = $3. So total price is $40 + $3 = $43. Exactly what Carlos has. So that seems correct.

But let me check if there's a possibility that the tax is applied before the discount. Wait, the problem says "prices reduced by 20% on every pair of shoes," so the discount is applied first, then the tax. So the order is: original price → 20% discount → discounted price → 7.5% tax on discounted price. So yes, the calculation we did is correct.

But just to be thorough, let's consider the other order. Suppose tax is applied first, then discount. Then the calculation would be different. Let's see: original price P. Apply 7.5% tax: P * 1.075, then 20% discount: 0.80 * 1.075P = 0.86P. Wait, same result. So regardless of the order, the total multiplier is 0.86P. That's interesting.

So that seems correct.

Based on execution_2.2:
But let me check with another example to be sure. Suppose original price is $100.
After 20% discount, it's $80. Then 7.5% tax is $6, total $86. So 0.86*100=86. So yes, the multiplier is 0.86. So the calculation is correct.

Wait, that's a mathematical property. Because multiplication is commutative. So 0.8 * 1.075 is the same as 1.075 * 0.8. So regardless of the order, the result is the same. So in this case, the total multiplier is indeed 0.86. Therefore, the calculation is correct.

Therefore, the original price is $50. But Carlos has $43. So the original price of the most expensive shoes he can afford is $50. But let me make sure that if the original price was higher than $50, say $51, then the total price would be 0.86*51 = 43.86, which is more than $43. So Carlos can't afford that. So $50 is the maximum original price.
</execution_3.1>
</Execution_3>

<Final_answer>
Therefore, the original price of the most expensive shoes Carlos could afford to buy is $\boxed{\$50}$.
