<Question>
Consider the set of complex numbers $z$ satisfying $|1+z+z^{2}|=4$. The maximum value of the imaginary part of $z$ can be written in the form $\tfrac{\sqrt{m}}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?
</Question>

<Plan_1>
Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. So, we need to find the maximum value of the imaginary part of a complex number z that satisfies |1 + z + z²| = 4. Then express that maximum imaginary part as √m / n, where m and n are coprime, and find m + n. Hmm, complex numbers, modulus, and optimization. Let me think step by step.

First, let's recall that any complex number z can be written as x + yi, where x and y are real numbers. But maybe there's a better way to handle this without breaking it into real and imaginary parts. Sometimes, using polar form or some algebraic manipulation can simplify things. Let's see.

The condition given is |1 + z + z²| = 4. So, the modulus of the complex expression 1 + z + z² is 4. To find the imaginary part of z, which is y, we need to maximize y. So, we need to find the z = x + yi that satisfies the modulus condition and has the largest possible y.

<prompt_1.1> Write the complex number z in terms of real and imaginary parts and express the given condition in terms of these parts. </prompt_1.1>
-----

Alternatively, maybe we can use calculus here. Let's see. Suppose we parameterize z. Since we need to maximize the imaginary part, perhaps we can use Lagrange multipliers with the constraint |1 + z + z²| = 4. Let me try that approach.

Let z = x + yi. Then, the constraint is |1 + z + z²| = 4. Let's compute 1 + z + z²:

<prompt_1.2> Use Lagrange multipliers to maximize the imaginary part of z subject to the given constraint. </prompt_1.2>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
Let me try writing z as x + yi and substitute into the equation. Then, compute 1 + z + z², take its modulus, set it equal to 4, and then express the imaginary part in terms of y. Then, maximize y under that constraint.

Let's start by writing z = x + yi. Then:

z² = (x + yi)² = x² - y² + 2xyi

So, 1 + z + z² = 1 + (x + yi) + (x² - y² + 2xyi) = (1 + x + x² - y²) + (y + 2xy)i

Therefore, the modulus squared of this complex number is:

(1 + x + x² - y²)² + (y + 2xy)² = 16
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
1 + (x + yi) + (x + yi)² = 1 + x + yi + (x² - y² + 2xyi) = (1 + x + x² - y²) + (y + 2xy)i.

So, the modulus squared is (1 + x + x² - y²)² + (y + 2xy)² = 16. Let me denote this as:

[(1 + x + x² - y²)]² + [y(1 + 2x)]² = 16.

We need to maximize y subject to this equation. Let's denote this as the function F(x, y) = [(1 + x + x² - y²)]² + [y(1 + 2x)]² - 16 = 0.

To maximize y, we can set up the Lagrangian. Let L = y - λ[(1 + x + x² - y²)² + (y(1 + 2x))² - 16]. Taking partial derivatives:

∂L/∂x = -λ[2(1 + x + x² - y²)(1 + 2x) + 2y(1 + 2x)(y)] = 0.

∂L/∂y = 1 - λ[2(1 + x + x² - y²)(-2y) + 2(y(1 + 2x))(1 + 2x)] = 0.

∂L/∂λ = -(1 + x + x² - y²)² - (y(1 + 2x))² + 16 = 0.

So, the first equation:

-λ[2(1 + x + x² - y²)(1 + 2x) + 2y(1 + 2x)y] = 0.

Assuming λ ≠ 0 (since if λ = 0, the second equation would imply 1 = 0, which is impossible), we can divide by -λ:

2(1 + x + x² - y²)(1 + 2x) + 2y²(1 + 2x) = 0.

Factor out 2(1 + 2x):

2(1 + 2x)[(1 + x + x² - y²) + y²] = 0.

Simplify inside the brackets:

(1 + x + x² - y² + y²) = 1 + x + x².

Thus, 2(1 + 2x)(1 + x + x²) = 0.

So, either 1 + 2x = 0 or 1 + x + x² = 0.

Case 1: 1 + 2x = 0 => x = -1/2.

Case 2: 1 + x + x² = 0. The discriminant is 1 - 4 = -3, so no real solutions. Therefore, only x = -1/2 is possible.

So, critical point at x = -1/2. Let's substitute x = -1/2 into the constraint equation and solve for y.

Original equation:

[(1 + x + x² - y²)]² + [y(1 + 2x)]² = 16.

Substitute x = -1/2:

First term: 1 + (-1/2) + (-1/2)² - y² = 1 - 1/2 + 1/4 - y² = (1 - 1/2) + 1/4 - y² = 1/2 + 1/4 - y² = 3/4 - y².

Second term: y(1 + 2*(-1/2)) = y(1 -1) = y*0 = 0.

Therefore, the equation becomes (3/4 - y²)² + 0 = 16.

Thus, (3/4 - y²)² = 16.

Take square roots:

3/4 - y² = ±4.

Case 1.1: 3/4 - y² = 4 => -y² = 4 - 3/4 = 13/4 => y² = -13/4. Not possible, since y² can't be negative.

Case 1.2: 3/4 - y² = -4 => -y² = -4 - 3/4 = -19/4 => y² = 19/4 => y = ±√(19)/2.

So, the possible y values at x = -1/2 are ±√19/2. Therefore, the maximum imaginary part is √19/2.

So, expanding the equation:

</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
(1 + x + x² - y²)² + (y + 2xy)² = 16.

Let me expand both terms. Starting with the first term:

(1 + x + x² - y²)². Let's expand this as:

Let A = 1 + x + x² - y². Then A² = (1 + x + x²)² - 2(1 + x + x²)y² + y⁴.

Similarly, the second term is (y + 2xy)² = y² + 4x²y² + 4xy².

So, adding both terms:

[(1 + x + x²)² - 2(1 + x + x²)y² + y⁴] + [y² + 4x²y² + 4xy²] = 16.

Let me combine like terms:

First, expand (1 + x + x²)²:
1 + 2x + 3x² + 2x³ + x⁴.

Then, the first term becomes:
1 + 2x + 3x² + 2x³ + x⁴ - 2(1 + x + x²)y² + y⁴.

Adding the second term:

+ y² + 4x²y² + 4xy².

So, combining all terms:

1 + 2x + 3x² + 2x³ + x⁴ - 2(1 + x + x²)y² + y⁴ + y² + 4x²y² + 4xy² = 16.

Now, let's collect like terms:

The constant term: 1.

Linear term in x: 2x.

Quadratic terms in x: 3x² + 4x²y² (from 4x²y²) + 4xy² (from 4xy²). Wait, no, x² terms are 3x² from the expansion and 4x²y² as a separate term. Similarly, y² terms: -2(1 + x + x²)y² + y² + 4x²y² + 4xy².

Let me handle the y² terms first:

-2(1 + x + x²)y² + y² + 4x²y² + 4xy²

= (-2y² - 2xy² - 2x²y²) + y² + 4x²y² + 4xy²

= (-2y² + y²) + (-2xy² + 4xy²) + (-2x²y² + 4x²y²)

= (-y²) + (2xy²) + (2x²y²)

Similarly, the cubic term: 2x³.

Quartic term: x⁴.

Other terms: 2x.

So, putting it all together:

x⁴ + 2x³ + 3x² + 2x + (-y² + 2xy² + 2x²y²) + (-2x²y² + 4x²y²) + ... Wait, maybe I need to re-express step by step.

Wait, perhaps it's better to collect all terms step by step.

Let's list all terms:

1. 1 (constant term)

2. 2x (linear in x)

3. 3x² (quadratic in x)

4. 2x³ (cubic in x)

5. x⁴ (quartic in x)

6. -2(1 + x + x²)y² + y² + 4x²y² + 4xy²

Let's compute term 6:

-2(1 + x + x²)y² + y² + 4x²y² + 4xy²

= (-2y² - 2xy² - 2x²y²) + y² + 4x²y² + 4xy²

= (-2y² + y²) + (-2xy² + 4xy²) + (-2x²y² + 4x²y²)

= (-y²) + (2xy²) + (2x²y²)

So, term 6 simplifies to -y² + 2xy² + 2x²y².

Therefore, combining all terms:

x⁴ + 2x³ + 3x² + 2x + 1 + (-y² + 2xy² + 2x²y²) = 16.

So, bringing the 16 to the left:

x⁴ + 2x³ + 3x² + 2x + 1 - y² + 2xy² + 2x²y² - 16 = 0.

Simplify constants:

1 - 16 = -15.

So:

x⁴ + 2x³ + 3x² + 2x - y² + 2xy² + 2x²y² - 15 = 0.

Hmm, this seems complicated. Let's see if we can factor or simplify terms.

Looking at the terms involving y²:

- y² + 2xy² + 2x²y² = y²(-1 + 2x + 2x²).

So, substituting back:

x⁴ + 2x³ + 3x² + 2x + y²(-1 + 2x + 2x²) - 15 = 0.

Let me denote the coefficient of y² as C(x) = -1 + 2x + 2x².

So, the equation becomes:

x⁴ + 2x³ + 3x² + 2x + C(x)y² - 15 = 0.

But C(x) = 2x² + 2x - 1. So, perhaps we can write the equation as:

x⁴ + 2x³ + 3x² + 2x - 15 + y²(2x² + 2x - 1) = 0.

But I don't see an immediate way to factor this. Maybe we can rearrange terms:

Let's move the x terms to the other side:

y²(2x² + 2x - 1) = -x⁴ - 2x³ - 3x² - 2x + 15.

Therefore,

y² = [ -x⁴ - 2x³ - 3x² - 2x + 15 ] / (2x² + 2x - 1).

Since y² must be non-negative, the right-hand side must be non-negative. Therefore, the numerator and denominator must have the same sign.

But this seems messy. Maybe there's a better approach.

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Wait, perhaps instead of expanding everything, we can use the fact that |1 + z + z²| = 4. Let me recall that for complex numbers, |a + b + c|² = |a|² + |b|² + |c|² + 2 Re(ab̄ + ac̄ + bc̄).

<prompt_3.1> Use the property of complex numbers to express the modulus squared of 1 + z + z² and simplify the equation. </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
But maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps we can write z in terms of its real and imaginary parts and then use the modulus condition. Let me try that again.

Let z = x + yi. Then, 1 + z + z² = 1 + x + yi + (x + yi)².

Expanding z²: (x + yi)² = x² - y² + 2xyi.

So, 1 + z + z² = 1 + x + yi + x² - y² + 2xyi = (1 + x + x² - y²) + (y + 2xy)i.

Therefore, the modulus squared is (1 + x + x² - y²)² + (y + 2xy)² = 16.

So, this is the same equation as before. Let me write that again:

(1 + x + x² - y²)² + (y + 2xy)² = 16.

Let me denote A = 1 + x + x² - y² and B = y + 2xy. Then, A² + B² = 16.

Our goal is to maximize y, so perhaps we can consider this as a constraint and use calculus or Lagrange multipliers.

Alternatively, maybe we can parametrize x and y such that this equation holds. Let me try to make a substitution. Let me set t = x. Then, we have two equations:

A = 1 + t + t² - y²

B = y(1 + 2t)

And A² + B² = 16.

So, substituting A and B into the equation:

(1 + t + t² - y²)² + [y(1 + 2t)]² = 16.

Let me expand this:

First term: (1 + t + t² - y²)² = (1 + t + t²)² - 2(1 + t + t²)y² + y⁴.

Second term: [y(1 + 2t)]² = y²(1 + 2t)² = y²(1 + 4t + 4t²).

Therefore, adding them together:

(1 + t + t²)² - 2(1 + t + t²)y² + y⁴ + y²(1 + 4t + 4t²) = 16.

Let's expand (1 + t + t²)²:

= 1 + 2t + 3t² + 2t³ + t⁴.

So, substituting back:

1 + 2t + 3t² + 2t³ + t⁴ - 2(1 + t + t²)y² + y⁴ + y²(1 + 4t + 4t²) = 16.

Now, collect like terms:

The constant term: 1.

Linear term: 2t.

Quadratic terms: 3t² + y²(1 + 4t + 4t²) - 2(1 + t + t²)y².

Cubic term: 2t³.

Quartic term: t⁴.

And y⁴.

Let's compute the quadratic terms:

3t² + y²(1 + 4t + 4t² - 2 - 2t - 2t²)

= 3t² + y²(-1 + 2t + 2t²).

So, combining all terms:

1 + 2t + 3t² + 2t³ + t⁴ + (-1 + 2t + 2t²)y² + y⁴ = 16.

Bring the 16 to the left:

1 + 2t + 3t² + 2t³ + t⁴ + (-1 + 2t + 2t²)y² + y⁴ - 16 = 0.

Simplify constants:

1 - 16 = -15.

So:

t⁴ + 2t³ + 3t² + 2t - 15 + (-1 + 2t + 2t²)y² + y⁴ = 0.

This still seems complicated. Maybe we can factor the quartic equation or look for substitutions.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the substitution u = t + something. Alternatively, consider that this equation is a quadratic in y². Let me rearrange the equation:

y⁴ + (-1 + 2t + 2t²)y² + (t⁴ + 2t³ + 3t² + 2t - 15) = 0.

Let me write this as:

y⁴ + [2t² + 2t - 1]y² + [t⁴ + 2t³ + 3t² + 2t - 15] = 0.

Let me denote this as a quadratic in y²:

Let w = y². Then:

w² + [2t² + 2t - 1]w + [t⁴ + 2t³ + 3t² + 2t - 15] = 0.

For this quadratic equation in w to have real solutions, the discriminant must be non-negative. The discriminant D is:

D = [2t² + 2t - 1]^2 - 4 * 1 * [t⁴ + 2t³ + 3t² + 2t - 15].

Compute D:

First, expand [2t² + 2t - 1]^2:

= (2t²)^2 + (2t)^2 + (-1)^2 + 2*(2t²)(2t) + 2*(2t²)(-1) + 2*(2t)(-1)

= 4t⁴ + 4t² + 1 + 8t³ - 4t² - 4t

= 4t⁴ + 8t³ + 0t² - 4t + 1.

Then, subtract 4*(t⁴ + 2t³ + 3t² + 2t - 15):

= 4t⁴ + 8t³ + 0t² - 4t + 1 - 4t⁴ - 8t³ - 12t² - 8t + 60

= (4t⁴ - 4t⁴) + (8t³ - 8t³) + (0t² - 12t²) + (-4t - 8t) + (1 + 60)

= -12t² - 12t + 61.

Therefore, the discriminant D = -12t² - 12t + 61.

For the quadratic in w to have real solutions, D ≥ 0:

-12t² - 12t + 61 ≥ 0.

Multiply both sides by -1 (inequality sign changes):

12t² + 12t - 61 ≤ 0.

Solve 12t² + 12t - 61 ≤ 0.

First, find roots of 12t² + 12t - 61 = 0.

Using quadratic formula:

t = [-12 ± √(144 + 4*12*61)] / (2*12)

Compute discriminant:

144 + 4*12*61 = 144 + 2928 = 3072.

√3072 = √(1024*3) = 32√3.

So, t = [-12 ± 32√3]/24 = [-12 ± 32√3]/24 = [-3 ± 8√3]/6.

Therefore, the quadratic 12t² + 12t - 61 is ≤ 0 between the roots:

t ∈ [ (-3 - 8√3)/6 , (-3 + 8√3)/6 ].

Approximately, compute the numerical values to understand the interval:

First root: (-3 - 8√3)/6 ≈ (-3 - 13.856)/6 ≈ (-16.856)/6 ≈ -2.809.

Second root: (-3 + 8√3)/6 ≈ (-3 + 13.856)/6 ≈ 10.856/6 ≈ 1.809.

So, t must be between approximately -2.809 and 1.809.

But this is a lot of algebra. Maybe there's a smarter substitution or another approach.

Wait, perhaps we can use the fact that 1 + z + z² is a geometric series.

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
If z ≠ 1, then 1 + z + z² = (z³ - 1)/(z - 1). But since |1 + z + z²| = 4, this might be useful. However, z could be 1, but if z = 1, then 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, which has modulus 3, not 4, so z ≠ 1. Therefore, we can write 1 + z + z² = (z³ - 1)/(z - 1). Therefore, |(z³ - 1)/(z - 1)| = 4. So, |z³ - 1| = 4|z - 1|.

Hmm, that might be a useful equation. Let me write that:

|z³ - 1| = 4|z - 1|.

But I'm not sure if this helps. Maybe we can write z³ - 1 = (z - 1)(z² + z + 1). So, |z³ - 1| = |z - 1||z² + z + 1|.

Therefore, the equation becomes |z - 1||z² + z + 1| = 4|z - 1|.

Assuming z ≠ 1 (since if z = 1, as before, modulus is 3 ≠ 4), we can divide both sides by |z - 1|:

|z² + z + 1| = 4.

Therefore, the condition simplifies to |z² + z + 1| = 4.

Wait, that's a simpler equation! So, instead of dealing with |1 + z + z²| = 4, we can use |z² + z + 1| = 4.

That might be easier to handle. Let me verify that step again.

We have 1 + z + z² = (z³ - 1)/(z - 1) when z ≠ 1. Therefore, |1 + z + z²| = |z³ - 1| / |z - 1| = 4. Therefore, |z³ - 1| = 4|z - 1|. Then, factor z³ - 1 as (z - 1)(z² + z + 1), so |z - 1||z² + z + 1| = 4|z - 1|. If z ≠ 1, we can cancel |z - 1|, leading to |z² + z + 1| = 4. Yes, that's correct. So, the condition reduces to |z² + z + 1| = 4.

= (x² - y² + 2xyi) + (x + yi) + 1

= (x² - y² + x + 1) + (2xy + y)i.

Therefore, z² + z + 1 = (x² - y² + x + 1) + (2xy + y)i.

The modulus squared is:

(x² - y² + x + 1)^2 + (2xy + y)^2 = 16.

So, we have:

(x² - y² + x + 1)^2 + (2xy + y)^2 = 16.

This seems similar to the previous equation but perhaps easier to handle. Let me write this as:

Let A = x² - y² + x + 1 and B = 2xy + y. Then, A² + B² = 16.

We need to maximize y. Let's see if we can express A and B in terms that might be easier to handle.

First, note that B = y(2x + 1). So, B is proportional to y. Similarly, A = x² + x + 1 - y².

So, A = (x² + x + 1) - y².

Let me denote C = x² + x + 1. Then, A = C - y².

Therefore, the equation becomes:

(C - y²)^2 + (y(2x + 1))^2 = 16.

Expanding:

C² - 2C y² + y⁴ + y²(2x + 1)^2 = 16.

But C = x² + x + 1, so substitute back:

(x² + x + 1)^2 - 2(x² + x + 1)y² + y⁴ + y²(2x + 1)^2 = 16.

Let me expand (x² + x + 1)^2:

= x⁴ + 2x³ + 3x² + 2x + 1.

So, substituting:

x⁴ + 2x³ + 3x² + 2x + 1 - 2(x² + x + 1)y² + y⁴ + y²(4x² + 4x + 1) = 16.

Combine like terms:

The y² terms:

-2(x² + x + 1)y² + (4x² + 4x + 1)y² = [ -2x² - 2x - 2 + 4x² + 4x + 1 ] y² = (2x² + 2x - 1)y².

So, the entire equation becomes:

x⁴ + 2x³ + 3x² + 2x + 1 + (2x² + 2x - 1)y² + y⁴ = 16.

Which is the same equation as before. Hmm, so we're back to where we were earlier. Maybe this approach isn't simplifying things.

Alternatively, perhaps we can parametrize y and express x in terms of y.

Wait, maybe we can consider that we need to maximize y. Let's assume that the maximum occurs when the imaginary part is maximized, which might correspond to certain symmetry in the equation.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that |z² + z + 1| = 4. Let me write z² + z + 1 = 4 e^{iθ}, where θ is some angle. Then, z² + z + 1 is a complex number with modulus 4. But I don't see an immediate way to solve this.

But in our case, a = z² and b = z + 1. So:

|z² + z + 1|² = |z²|² + |z + 1|² + 2 Re(z² \overline{(z + 1)}).

But this seems more complicated. Let me compute it:

|z² + z + 1|² = |z²|² + |z + 1|² + 2 Re(z² \overline{z + 1}).

Compute each term:

|z²|² = |z|⁴.

|z + 1|² = |z|² + 2 Re(z) + 1.

Re(z² \overline{z + 1}) = Re(z² ( \overline{z} + 1 )) = Re(z² \overline{z} + z²) = Re(|z|² z + z²).

Wait, this might not be helpful. Let me see:

z² \overline{z + 1} = z² (\overline{z} + 1) = z² \overline{z} + z² = |z|² z + z². Then, taking the real part:

Re(|z|² z + z²) = |z|² Re(z) + Re(z²).

But this seems messy. Maybe this approach isn't helpful. Let's try another way.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that z² + z + 1 = 4 e^{iθ}, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe we can parameterize z in polar form. Let z = r e^{iφ}. Then, z² = r² e^{i2φ}, so z² + z + 1 = r² e^{i2φ} + r e^{iφ} + 1. The modulus of this is 4. So:

| r² e^{i2φ} + r e^{iφ} + 1 | = 4.

But this seems complicated to solve. Alternatively, maybe assume that z lies on a certain curve, but I don't see a straightforward way.

Alternatively, let me think geometrically. The equation |z² + z + 1| = 4 represents a curve in the complex plane. We need to find the point on this curve with the maximum imaginary part.
