Okay, so I need to find the acute angle between two lines with slopes 2 and 1/3. Hmm, let me remember how to do this. I think there's a formula involving the tangent of the angle between two lines. Let me try to recall.

<prompt_1.1> Recall and write down the formula for the tangent of the angle between two lines with slopes m₁ and m₂. </prompt_1.1>

If two lines have slopes m₁ and m₂, then the tangent of the angle θ between them is given by |(m₂ - m₁)/(1 + m₁m₂)|. Right, that's the formula. So first, I need to compute the difference in slopes divided by 1 plus the product of the slopes, then take the absolute value to ensure it's positive. Then, once I have the tangent, I can take the arctangent to find the angle in degrees.

Let me write that down step by step.

Wait, but just to make sure I didn't mix up the slopes. Sometimes the formula is written as |(m₁ - m₂)/(1 + m₁m₂)|, but since we take absolute value, it doesn't matter the order. So swapping m₁ and m₂ would give the same result. So whether I take (2 - 1/3) or (1/3 - 2), the absolute value would be the same. Let's check that.

<prompt_2.2> Verify the formula by swapping the slopes and recalculating the tangent of the angle. </prompt_2.2>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
First, identify the slopes: m₁ = 2 and m₂ = 1/3. Then compute the numerator: m₂ - m₁ = (1/3) - 2. Let me compute that. 1/3 minus 2 is the same as 1/3 - 6/3 = -5/3. Then the denominator is 1 + m₁m₂ = 1 + (2)(1/3) = 1 + 2/3 = 5/3. So the tangent of the angle is |(-5/3) / (5/3)|. The absolute value of that is | -1 | = 1. Wait, so tanθ = 1.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
If I compute |(2 - 1/3)/(1 + 2*(1/3))|, that's |(5/3)/(1 + 2/3)| = |(5/3)/(5/3)| = 1. On the other hand, if I do |(1/3 - 2)/(1 + 2*(1/3))|, that's |(-5/3)/(5/3)| = | -1 | = 1. So yes, same result. So regardless of the order, we get 1. Therefore, the tangent of the angle is 1.

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
If tanθ = 1, then θ must be 45 degrees because tan(45°) = 1. Since the problem asks for the acute angle, and 45 degrees is already acute, that should be the answer.

Wait, but let me verify with another approach to be sure. Maybe using vectors or dot product? Let's see.

<prompt_3.1> Verify the result using vectors and the dot product formula for the angle between two lines. </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
Another way to find the angle between two lines is by using their direction vectors. The direction vector of a line with slope m is (1, m). So for the first line with slope 2, the direction vector is (1, 2), and for the second line with slope 1/3, the direction vector is (1, 1/3). The angle between these two vectors can be found using the dot product formula:

cosθ = (v ⋅ w) / (|v| |w|)

Compute the dot product: (1)(1) + (2)(1/3) = 1 + 2/3 = 5/3.

Compute the magnitudes:

|v| = sqrt(1² + 2²) = sqrt(1 + 4) = sqrt(5).

|w| = sqrt(1² + (1/3)²) = sqrt(1 + 1/9) = sqrt(10/9) = sqrt(10)/3.

So cosθ = (5/3) / (sqrt(5) * sqrt(10)/3) = (5/3) / (sqrt(50)/3) = 5 / sqrt(50) = 5 / (5*sqrt(2)) ) = 1/sqrt(2).

Therefore, cosθ = 1/√2, which means θ = 45 degrees. That's the same result as before. So this confirms that the angle between the two lines is indeed 45 degrees.

Based on execution_3.1:
Let me just visualize the lines to make sure.

<prompt_4.1> Visualize the lines and confirm the acute angle between them. </prompt_4.1>

The acute angle between the two lines is 45 degrees.

The first line with slope 2 is steeper, going up 2 units for every 1 unit right. The second line with slope 1/3 is much flatter, going up 1 unit for every 3 units right. Since one is steeper and the other is flatter, the angle between them should be less than 90 degrees. Since we got 45 degrees, which is acute, that makes sense.
