\[\log_{7x}2023\cdot \log_{289x}2023=\log_{2023x}2023\]
</Question>

<think>
<Plan_1>
Okay, let me try to figure out this logarithmic equation step by step. The equation given is:

\[\log_{7x}2023 \cdot \log_{289x}2023 = \log_{2023x}2023\]

First, I need to recall some logarithm properties. Remember, the logarithm \(\log_b a\) can be converted to natural logarithms using the change of base formula: \(\log_b a = \frac{\ln a}{\ln b}\). Maybe converting all the logarithms to the same base will make it easier to handle. Let me try that.

Let's rewrite each term using the change of base formula. Let's let \( \ln \) denote the natural logarithm.

<prompt_1.1> Rewrite the given logarithmic equation using the change of base formula as per the above plan. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
So,

\[
\log_{7x}2023 = \frac{\ln 2023}{\ln(7x)}
\]

Similarly,

\[
\log_{289x}2023 = \frac{\ln 2023}{\ln(289x)}
\]

And,

\[
\log_{2023x}2023 = \frac{\ln 2023}{\ln(2023x)}
\]

So substituting these into the original equation, we get:

\[
\left( \frac{\ln 2023}{\ln(7x)} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{\ln 2023}{\ln(289x)} \right) = \frac{\ln 2023}{\ln(2023x)}
\]
</execution_1.1>
</Execution_1>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Let me note that \(\ln 2023\) is a common factor in all terms, so maybe we can divide both sides by \(\ln 2023\) to simplify.

Dividing both sides by \(\ln 2023\), we get:

\[
\frac{1}{\ln(7x)} \cdot \frac{1}{\ln(289x)} = \frac{1}{\ln(2023x)}
\]

Which simplifies to:

<prompt_2.1> Simplify the equation by dividing both sides by \(\ln 2023\) and show the resulting equation. </prompt_2.1>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
\[
\frac{1}{\ln(7x) \cdot \ln(289x)} = \frac{1}{\ln(2023x)}
\]

Taking reciprocals on both sides (assuming none of the logarithms are zero, which should be valid here since the arguments are positive and the bases are valid), we get:

\[
\ln(7x) \cdot \ln(289x) = \ln(2023x)
\]

Now, let's let \( y = \ln x \). Then, \(\ln(7x) = \ln 7 + \ln x = \ln 7 + y\), and similarly for the others. Let me rewrite each logarithm in terms of \( y \):

\[
\ln(7x) = \ln 7 + y
\]
\[
\ln(289x) = \ln 289 + y
\]
\[
\ln(2023x) = \ln 2023 + y
\]

So substituting back into the equation:

\[
(\ln 7 + y)(\ln 289 + y) = \ln 2023 + y
\]

This is a quadratic equation in terms of \( y \). Let's expand the left-hand side:

First, multiply out the terms:

\[
(\ln 7)(\ln 289) + (\ln 7)y + (\ln 289)y + y^2 = \ln 2023 + y
\]

Combine like terms:
</execution_2.1>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Bring all terms to the left-hand side:

<prompt_3.1> Bring all terms to the left-hand side to form a quadratic equation in \( y \) and simplify. </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
\[
y^2 + (\ln 7 + \ln 289)y + (\ln 7)(\ln 289) - \ln 2023 - y = 0
\]

Simplify the terms:

The terms with \( y \) are:

\[
(\ln 7 + \ln 289 - 1)y
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
y^2 + (\ln 7 + \ln 289 - 1)y + (\ln 7)(\ln 289) - \ln 2023 = 0
\]

This is a quadratic equation in \( y \). Let's denote:

\( A = 1 \)

\( B = \ln 7 + \ln 289 - 1 \)

\( C = (\ln 7)(\ln 289) - \ln 2023 \)

So the equation is \( Ay^2 + By + C = 0 \). Let's compute the discriminant \( D = B^2 - 4AC \) to see if we can find solutions for \( y \).

But before that, let me check if there's a simpler way. Maybe the numbers 7, 289, and 2023 have some relationships that can be exploited here. Let's factorize them.
</execution_3.1>
</Execution_3>

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
289 is 17 squared, since 17*17=289. 2023, let me check.

<prompt_4.1> Factorize 2023 and check if it is a prime or a composite number. </prompt_4.1>

Wait, 2023 divided by 7: 7*289=2023, yes!

<prompt_4.2> Check if 7*289 equals 2023 and verify if this relationship can simplify the equation. </prompt_4.2>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
Divided by 7: 2023 ÷ 7. Let's compute 7*288=2016, so 2023-2016=7, so 2023=7*289. Wait, 7*289 is 2023. But 289 is 17². So 2023=7*17². Let me confirm: 7*17=119, 119*17=2023. Yes, because 17*100=1700, 17*10=170, 17*9=153; 1700+170+153=2023. So yes, 2023=7*17². Therefore, 2023=7*17², which is 7*289.
</execution_4.1>

<execution_4.2>
So 2023 = 7*17². Therefore, 2023 = 7*289. That's an important relationship. So 2023 is 7*289.

Therefore, \(\ln 2023 = \ln(7*289) = \ln 7 + \ln 289\).

This is a key point. So \(\ln 2023 = \ln 7 + \ln 289\).
</execution_4.2>
</Execution_4>

<Plan_5>
Based on execution_4.2:
Let me substitute this into the equation for C:

<prompt_5.1> Substitute \(\ln 2023 = \ln 7 + \ln 289\) into the equation and simplify the expression for \( C \). </prompt_5.1>
</Plan_5>

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
\( C = (\ln 7)(\ln 289) - (\ln 7 + \ln 289) \)

Factor out \(\ln 7 + \ln 289\):

\( C = (\ln 7)(\ln 289) - (\ln 7 + \ln 289) = (\ln 7 + \ln 289)(\ln 7 + \ln 289 - 1) - 1 \)

Wait, maybe not. Let's compute it:

\( (\ln 7)(\ln 289) - \ln 7 - \ln 289 = \ln 7 \ln 289 - \ln 7 - \ln 289 \)

Factor terms:

\( \ln 7 (\ln 289 - 1) - \ln 289 \)

But maybe not helpful. Let's see if there's another way. Alternatively, let's compute B.

Wait, B is \(\ln 7 + \ln 289 - 1\). Since \(\ln 289 = \ln(17²) = 2 \ln 17\), so B = \(\ln 7 + 2 \ln 17 - 1\). Not sure if that helps.
</execution_5.1>
</Execution_5>

<Plan_6>
Based on execution_5.1:
But perhaps we can substitute back into the quadratic equation. Let me write the quadratic equation again:

<prompt_6.1> Rewrite the quadratic equation in terms of \( y \) using the simplified values of \( B \) and \( C \). </prompt_6.1>
</Plan_6>

<Execution_6>
<execution_6.1>
\( y^2 + (\ln 7 + \ln 289 - 1)y + (\ln 7 \ln 289 - \ln 2023) = 0 \)

But since \(\ln 2023 = \ln 7 + \ln 289\), then substituting that into the equation:

\( y^2 + (\ln 7 + \ln 289 - 1)y + (\ln 7 \ln 289 - (\ln 7 + \ln 289)) = 0 \)

Let me denote \( A = \ln 7 \), \( B = \ln 289 \). Then the equation becomes:

\( y^2 + (A + B - 1)y + (AB - A - B) = 0 \)

Let me factor the constant term:

\( AB - A - B = AB - A - B = -A - B + AB = -(A + B) + AB \)

So the equation is:

\( y^2 + (A + B - 1)y - (A + B) + AB = 0 \)

Wait, maybe factor the quadratic:

Let me write it as:

\( y^2 + (A + B - 1)y + AB - A - B = 0 \)

Let me see if this can be factored. Let's try to group terms:

\( y^2 + (A + B - 1)y + AB - A - B \)

Let me write it as:

\( y^2 + (A + B - 1)y + AB - A - B = y^2 + (A + B - 1)y + AB - A - B \)

Hmm, maybe not straightforward. Alternatively, let's compute the discriminant D:

\( D = (A + B - 1)^2 - 4(1)(AB - A - B) \)

Expand the square:

\( D = (A + B - 1)^2 - 4AB + 4A + 4B \)

Expand the first term:

\( (A + B - 1)^2 = A² + 2AB + B² - 2A - 2B + 1 \)

So,

\( D = A² + 2AB + B² - 2A - 2B + 1 - 4AB + 4A + 4B \)

Combine like terms:

\( A² + (2AB - 4AB) + B² + (-2A + 4A) + (-2B + 4B) + 1 \)

Which simplifies to:

\( A² - 2AB + B² + 2A + 2B + 1 \)

Notice that \( A² - 2AB + B² = (A - B)^2 \), so:

\( D = (A - B)^2 + 2A + 2B + 1 \)

But since A = ln7 and B = ln289 = ln(17²) = 2ln17, so B = 2ln17. Therefore:

\( A - B = ln7 - 2ln17 \)

But 17 is a prime number, and 7 and 17 are co-prime, so ln7 - 2ln17 is just some constant. Let's compute the discriminant:

D = (ln7 - 2ln17)^2 + 2ln7 + 4ln17 + 1

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.
</execution_6.1>
</Execution_6>

<Plan_7>
Based on execution_6.1:
Let me recall that we had earlier that 2023 = 7*289, so maybe that can be used to relate the logarithms.

<prompt_7.1> Use the relationship \( 2023 = 7 \cdot 289 \) to express \( \ln 2023 \) in terms of \( \ln 7 \) and \( \ln 289 \), and simplify the equation. </prompt_7.1>
</Plan_7>

<Execution_7>
<execution_7.1>
Alternatively, perhaps there's a substitution that can simplify the equation. Let me think.

Alternatively, since all the logarithms are with different bases, maybe changing the base of the logarithms to 7x, 289x, etc. But that might complicate things.

Alternatively, let's consider that the equation is:

(\log_{7x}2023)(\log_{289x}2023) = \log_{2023x}2023

Let me denote t = \log_{2023x}2023. Then, since \log_b a = 1 / \log_a b, so t = 1 / \log_{2023x}2023. Wait, no, that's not helpful.

Alternatively, let me set t = \log_{2023x}2023. Then, t = \frac{\ln 2023}{\ln(2023x)} as before. But perhaps expressing the other logarithms in terms of t.

Wait, maybe another approach. Let me recall that \log_b a = \frac{1}{\log_a b}. So, \log_{7x}2023 = 1 / \log_{2023}(7x). Similarly, \log_{289x}2023 = 1 / \log_{2023}(289x). So the left-hand side becomes:

(1 / \log_{2023}(7x)) * (1 / \log_{2023}(289x)) = \log_{2023x}2023

But the right-hand side is \log_{2023x}2023 = 1 / \log_{2023x}2023? Wait, no. Wait, \log_{2023x}2023 is equal to \frac{\ln 2023}{\ln(2023x)}, as before.

Alternatively, perhaps using the property that \log_b a = \frac{1}{\log_a b}, so the left-hand side becomes:

\log_{7x}2023 * \log_{289x}2023 = \frac{1}{\log_{2023}(7x)} * \frac{1}{\log_{2023}(289x)} = \frac{1}{\log_{2023}(7x) \cdot \log_{2023}(289x)}

So the equation is:

\frac{1}{\log_{2023}(7x) \cdot \log_{2023}(289x)} = \log_{2023x}2023

But I don't see an immediate simplification here. Maybe let's express \log_{2023x}2023 in terms of \log_{2023}x. Let me recall that:

\log_{2023x}2023 = \frac{\log_{2023}2023}{\log_{2023}(2023x)} = \frac{1}{\log_{2023}2023 + \log_{2023}x} = \frac{1}{1 + \log_{2023}x}

Since \log_{2023}2023 = 1.

So the equation becomes:

\frac{1}{\log_{2023}(7x) \cdot \log_{2023}(289x)} = \frac{1}{1 + \log_{2023}x}

Taking reciprocals on both sides:

\log_{2023}(7x) \cdot \log_{2023}(289x) = 1 + \log_{2023}x

Let me denote \( z = \log_{2023}x \). Then, \log_{2023}(7x) = \log_{2023}7 + \log_{2023}x = \log_{2023}7 + z \). Similarly, \log_{2023}(289x) = \log_{2023}289 + z \). Therefore, the equation becomes:

\[
(\log_{2023}7 + z)(\log_{2023}289 + z) = 1 + z
\]

Expanding the left-hand side:

\[
(\log_{2023}7)(\log_{2023}289) + (\log_{2023}7 + \log_{2023}289)z + z^2 = 1 + z
\]

Bring all terms to the left-hand side:

\[
z^2 + (\log_{2023}7 + \log_{2023}289 - 1)z + (\log_{2023}7)(\log_{2023}289) - 1 = 0
\]

This is a quadratic equation in \( z \). Let's denote:

\( A = 1 \)

\( B = \log_{2023}7 + \log_{2023}289 - 1 \)

\( C = (\log_{2023}7)(\log_{2023}289) - 1 \)

So the equation is \( Az^2 + Bz + C = 0 \).

Now, let's compute B and C.

First, note that 2023 = 7*17², so:

\(\log_{2023}7 = \frac{\ln 7}{\ln 2023} = \frac{\ln 7}{\ln 7 + \ln 289}\)

Similarly,

\(\log_{2023}289 = \frac{\ln 289}{\ln 2023} = \frac{\ln 289}{\ln 7 + \ln 289}\)

But perhaps there's a better way. Let me recall that 2023 = 7*289, so:

\(\log_{2023}289 = \frac{\ln 289}{\ln 2023} = \frac{\ln(2023/7)}{\ln 2023} = \frac{\ln 2023 - \ln 7}{\ln 2023} = 1 - \frac{\ln 7}{\ln 2023} = 1 - \log_{2023}7\)

So, let me denote \( a = \log_{2023}7 \). Then, \(\log_{2023}289 = 1 - a\).

Therefore, B = \( a + (1 - a) - 1 = 0 \). Wait, that's interesting. So B = 0.

Similarly, C = \( a(1 - a) - 1 = a - a² - 1 \).

So the quadratic equation simplifies to:

\( z² + 0*z + (a - a² - 1) = 0 \)

Which is:

\( z² + (a - a² - 1) = 0 \)

Simplify the constant term:

\( a - a² - 1 = -a² + a - 1 \)

So the equation is:

\( z² - a² + a - 1 = 0 \)

Wait, no, it's:

\( z² + (-a² + a - 1) = 0 \)

So:

\( z² = a² - a + 1 \)

Therefore, solving for z:

\( z = \pm \sqrt{a² - a + 1} \)

But \( z = \log_{2023}x \), so:

\( \log_{2023}x = \pm \sqrt{a² - a + 1} \)

Therefore, solving for x:

\( x = 2023^{\pm \sqrt{a² - a + 1}} \)

But this seems a bit abstract. Maybe we can compute \( a² - a + 1 \).

Recall that \( a = \log_{2023}7 \). Let's compute \( a² - a + 1 \):

\( a² - a + 1 = \left( \frac{\ln 7}{\ln 2023} \right)^2 - \frac{\ln 7}{\ln 2023} + 1 \)

But this might not simplify nicely. Alternatively, perhaps there's a relationship between a and 1 - a. Let me note that:

Since \( a = \log_{2023}7 \), then \( 1 - a = \log_{2023}289 \), as established earlier.

Let me compute \( a(1 - a) \):

\( a(1 - a) = \log_{2023}7 \cdot \log_{2023}289 \)

But since 289 = 2023 / 7, so \( \log_{2023}289 = 1 - \log_{2023}7 = 1 - a \). So:

\( a(1 - a) = \log_{2023}7 \cdot \log_{2023}(2023/7) = \log_{2023}7 \cdot (1 - \log_{2023}7) = a(1 - a) \)

But I don't see a direct simplification here.

Alternatively, perhaps we can compute \( a² - a + 1 \):

\( a² - a + 1 = a(a - 1) + 1 \)

But since \( a = \log_{2023}7 \) and \( 1 - a = \log_{2023}289 \), so:

\( a² - a + 1 = a(- (1 - a)) + 1 = -a(1 - a) + 1 \)

Which is:

\( -a(1 - a) + 1 = -a + a² + 1 \), which is the same as before.

This seems like going in circles. Maybe we need to compute the discriminant of the quadratic equation in z.

Wait, the quadratic equation was \( z² + Bz + C = 0 \), with B = 0 and C = a - a² - 1. So the equation is \( z² + (a - a² - 1) = 0 \), which is \( z² = a² - a + 1 \). Therefore, the solutions are \( z = \pm \sqrt{a² - a + 1} \).

But since z = \log_{2023}x, then:

\( x = 2023^{\pm \sqrt{a² - a + 1}} \)

But this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better approach. Let me recall that the original equation was:

\(\log_{7x}2023 \cdot \log_{289x}2023 = \log_{2023x}2023\)

Given that 2023 = 7*289, perhaps there's a substitution that can exploit this relationship. Let me set k = 7x. Then, 289x = 289x, and 2023x = 7*289x. But not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, let me think about the properties of logarithms. Let me recall that \(\log_{ab}c = \log_a c / \log_b c\). Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using the change of base formula in a different way.

Alternatively, let me consider that all the logarithms can be expressed in terms of \(\log_{2023}x\). Let me see:

Let me denote t = \log_{2023}x. Then, since 2023 = 7*289, we have:

\(\log_{7x}2023 = \frac{\log_{2023}2023}{\log_{2023}(7x)} = \frac{1}{\log_{2023}7 + \log_{2023}x} = \frac{1}{\log_{2023}7 + t}\)

Similarly, \(\log_{289x}2023 = \frac{\log_{2023}2023}{\log_{2023}(289x)} = \frac{1}{\log_{2023}289 + t}\)

So the left-hand side becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{(\log_{2023}7 + t)(\log_{2023}289 + t)}
\]

The right-hand side is \(\log_{2023x}2023 = \frac{\log_{2023}2023}{\log_{2023}(2023x)} = \frac{1}{\log_{2023}2023 + \log_{2023}x} = \frac{1}{1 + t}\)

Therefore, the equation is:

\[
\frac{1}{(\log_{2023}7 + t)(\log_{2023}289 + t)} = \frac{1}{1 + t}
\]

Taking reciprocals:

\[
(\log_{2023}7 + t)(\log_{2023}289 + t) = 1 + t
\]

Which is the same as before, leading to the quadratic equation. So we are back to where we were before. Therefore, the solutions for t are:

\[
t = \pm \sqrt{a² - a + 1}
\]

But let's compute \( a² - a + 1 \).

Since \( a = \log_{2023}7 \), let's compute \( a² - a + 1 \):

First, note that \( a = \frac{\ln 7}{\ln 2023} \), so:

\( a² = \frac{(\ln 7)^2}{(\ln 2023)^2} \)

Then,

\( a² - a + 1 = \frac{(\ln 7)^2}{(\ln 2023)^2} - \frac{\ln 7}{\ln 2023} + 1 \)

Let me denote \( k = \frac{\ln 7}{\ln 2023} \), so \( a = k \). Then:

\( a² - a + 1 = k² - k + 1 \)

But we can compute \( k² - k + 1 \):

Not sure if this helps. Alternatively, maybe there's a relationship between k and 1 - k. Let me compute 1 - k:

\( 1 - k = 1 - \frac{\ln 7}{\ln 2023} = \frac{\ln 2023 - \ln 7}{\ln 2023} = \frac{\ln(2023/7)}{\ln 2023} = \log_{2023}289 \)

So, 1 - k = log_{2023}289 = b, say. Then, k(1 - k) = k*b = \log_{2023}7 * \log_{2023}289.

But from before, we have that 2023 = 7*289, so log_{2023}7 + log_{2023}289 = 1. Let me denote c = log_{2023}7, so log_{2023}289 = 1 - c. Then, c(1 - c) is the product. But not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps we can compute k² - k + 1:

k² - k + 1 = k(k - 1) + 1

But since k + (1 - k) = 1, so k - 1 = - (1 - k). Therefore:

k(k - 1) + 1 = -k(1 - k) + 1 = -k*b + 1

But this might not help. Alternatively, maybe compute numerically.

Wait, perhaps instead of symbolic manipulation, we can compute the numerical value of \( a² - a + 1 \).

Let me compute \( a = \log_{2023}7 \). Since 2023 = 7*289, and 289 = 17², so 2023 = 7*17². Therefore, log_{2023}7 = 1 / log_7 2023. Since 2023 = 7*17², log_7 2023 = log_7 7 + log_7 17² = 1 + 2 log_7 17. Therefore, log_{2023}7 = 1 / (1 + 2 log_7 17).

But this is getting complicated. Alternatively, let me compute the numerical value.

First, compute ln7 ≈ 1.9459101490553132

ln2023 ≈ ln(2000) + ln(2023/2000) ≈ 7.6009024595 + 0.0108506944 ≈ 7.6117531539

Therefore, a = ln7 / ln2023 ≈ 1.9459101490553132 / 7.6117531539 ≈ 0.2561

Then, a² - a + 1 ≈ (0.2561)^2 - 0.2561 + 1 ≈ 0.0656 - 0.2561 + 1 ≈ 0.0656 - 0.2561 = -0.1905 + 1 ≈ 0.8095

So sqrt(a² - a + 1) ≈ sqrt(0.8095) ≈ 0.9003

Therefore, z = log_{2023}x = ±0.9003

Thus, x = 2023^{±0.9003}

Compute 2023^{0.9003} and 2023^{-0.9003}

First, note that 2023^1 = 2023, so 2023^{0.9003} ≈ 2023^{0.9} ≈ e^{0.9 ln2023} ≈ e^{0.9 *7.6117531539} ≈ e^{6.8505778385} ≈ 944.0

Similarly, 2023^{-0.9003} ≈ 1 / 2023^{0.9003} ≈ 1/944 ≈ 0.001059

Therefore, the two solutions are approximately 944 and 0.001059.

But these are approximate values. However, since the problem asks for the product of all solutions, and the solutions are x1 and x2, then the product x1 * x2 = 2023^{0.9003} * 2023^{-0.9003} = 2023^{0} = 1

Wait, that's a key insight! The product of the solutions of a quadratic equation \( z² = k \) is \( k \) if the equation is \( z² = k \). But in our case, the equation was \( z² = a² - a + 1 \), so the product of the solutions z1 * z2 = a² - a + 1. But wait, in the quadratic equation \( z² - (a² - a + 1) = 0 \), the product of the roots is \( C = a² - a + 1 \). But earlier, we had \( z² = a² - a + 1 \), which can be written as \( z² - (a² - a + 1) = 0 \), so the product of the roots is indeed \( a² - a + 1 \).

But in our case, z = log_{2023}x, so if we have two solutions z1 and z2, then x1 = 2023^{z1} and x2 = 2023^{z2}. Therefore, the product x1 * x2 = 2023^{z1 + z2}.

But wait, in the quadratic equation in z, the sum of the roots is -B/A = 0, since B = 0. Therefore, z1 + z2 = 0.

Therefore, x1 * x2 = 2023^{z1 + z2} = 2023^0 = 1

Therefore, the product of all solutions is 1, regardless of the value of a² - a + 1. Therefore, the answer is 1.
