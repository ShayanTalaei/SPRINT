<Question>
Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

Okay, so I need to solve this system of logarithmic equations and then find the absolute value of log base 2 of x^4 y^3 z^2. Let me start by writing down the equations again to make sure I have them right.

<prompt_1.1> Write down the given system of logarithmic equations and simplify them using logarithm properties to express x, y, and z in terms of each other. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
The equations are:

1. log₂(x/(yz)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y/(xz)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z/(xy)) = 1/4

Hmm, logarithms with base 2. Maybe I can convert these logarithmic equations into exponential form to make them easier to handle. Let me recall that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a.

So applying that to the first equation:

log₂(x/(yz)) = 1/2 ⇒ 2^(1/2) = x/(yz)
</execution_1.1>
</Execution_1>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Similarly, the second equation:

log₂(y/(xz)) = 1/3 ⇒ 2^(1/3) = y/(xz)

<prompt_2.1> Convert the second and third logarithmic equations into exponential form and express y and z in terms of x. </prompt_2.1>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
And the third equation:

log₂(z/(xy)) = 1/4 ⇒ 2^(1/4) = z/(xy)

So now I have three equations:

1. x/(yz) = 2^(1/2)
2. y/(xz) = 2^(1/3)
3. z/(xy) = 2^(1/4)

Hmm, these look like reciprocal relationships. Maybe I can multiply all three equations together to see if that simplifies things. Let's try that.

Multiplying the left sides: (x/(yz)) * (y/(xz)) * (z/(xy)) = [x * y * z] / [yz * xz * xy]

Simplifying the numerator and denominator:

Numerator: x * y * z
Denominator: yz * xz * xy = (x * y * z)^2

So the left side becomes (x * y * z) / (x * y * z)^2 = 1/(x * y * z)

Now the right side: 2^(1/2) * 2^(1/3) * 2^(1/4) = 2^(1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4)

Let me compute the exponent: 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4. To add these fractions, common denominator is 12.

1/2 = 6/12, 1/3 = 4/12, 1/4 = 3/12. So total exponent is (6 + 4 + 3)/12 = 13/12.

Therefore, 2^(13/12) = 1/(x * y * z)

So 1/(x * y * z) = 2^(13/12) ⇒ x * y * z = 2^(-13/12)

Okay, that's interesting. So the product of x, y, z is 2^(-13/12). Let me note that.

Based on execution_2.1:
Now, maybe I can express each variable in terms of the others? Let's look at the first equation again:

<prompt_3.1> Solve the first equation for x in terms of y and z, and substitute into the third equation to find a relationship between y and z. </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
1. x/(yz) = 2^(1/2) ⇒ x = yz * 2^(1/2)

Similarly, from the second equation:

2. y/(xz) = 2^(1/3) ⇒ y = xz * 2^(1/3)

And from the third equation:

3. z/(xy) = 2^(1/4) ⇒ z = xy * 2^(1/4)
</execution_3.1>
</Execution_3>

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
Maybe substitute these expressions into each other. Let's try substituting equation 1 into equation 2.

<prompt_4.1> Substitute x from equation 1 into equation 2 and solve for y in terms of z. </prompt_4.1>

Now, substitute x from equation 1 and y from equation 2 into equation 3.

<prompt_4.2> Substitute x and y from equations 1 and 2 into equation 3 and solve for z. </prompt_4.2>

But let me check this result with the product x * y * z.

<prompt_4.3> Verify the found values of x, y, and z by calculating x * y * z and confirming it matches 2^(-13/12). </prompt_4.3>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
From equation 2: y = xz * 2^(1/3). But from equation 1, x = yz * 2^(1/2). Substitute x into equation 2:

y = (yz * 2^(1/2)) * z * 2^(1/3) = y * z^2 * 2^(1/2 + 1/3)

Simplify the exponent: 1/2 + 1/3 = 5/6. So:

y = y * z^2 * 2^(5/6)

Assuming y ≠ 0 (which it isn't, since x, y, z are positive reals), we can divide both sides by y:

1 = z^2 * 2^(5/6)

Therefore, z^2 = 2^(-5/6) ⇒ z = 2^(-5/12)

Since z is positive, we take the positive root.
</execution_4.1>

<execution_4.2>
Equation 3: z = xy * 2^(1/4)

But x = yz * 2^(1/2), so substitute that into z:

z = (yz * 2^(1/2)) * y * 2^(1/4)

Simplify this:

z = y^2 z * 2^(1/2 + 1/4) = y^2 z * 2^(3/4)

Hmm, so z = y^2 z * 2^(3/4). Let's divide both sides by z (since z is positive and non-zero):

1 = y^2 * 2^(3/4)

Therefore, y^2 = 2^(-3/4) ⇒ y = 2^(-3/8)

Wait, let me check that step again. If z = y^2 z * 2^(3/4), then divide both sides by z:

1 = y^2 * 2^(3/4)

So y^2 = 1 / 2^(3/4) = 2^(-3/4)

Taking square root, since y is positive:

y = 2^(-3/8)
</execution_4.2>

<execution_4.3>
If x = 2^(1/2) * y * z, and y = 2^(1/3) * x * z, then substituting x into y's equation:

y = 2^(1/3) * (2^(1/2) * y * z) * z = 2^(1/3) * 2^(1/2) * y * z^2

Simplify the exponents: 2^(1/3 + 1/2) = 2^(5/6)

So y = 2^(5/6) * y * z^2

Divide both sides by y (since y ≠ 0):

1 = 2^(5/6) * z^2 ⇒ z^2 = 2^(-5/6) ⇒ z = 2^(-5/12)

Okay, so z is 2^(-5/12). Then from equation 1, x = 2^(1/2) * y * z. Let's plug z into that.

x = 2^(1/2) * y * 2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/2 - 5/12) * y = 2^(6/12 - 5/12) * y = 2^(1/12) * y

So x is 2^(1/12) times y. Then from equation 2, y = 2^(1/3) * x * z. Substitute x and z:

y = 2^(1/3) * (2^(1/12) * y) * 2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/3) * 2^(1/12) * 2^(-5/12) * y

Combine exponents: 1/3 + 1/12 - 5/12 = (4/12 + 1/12 - 5/12) = 0/12 = 0

So 2^(0) * y = 1 * y = y. So that checks out. So y = y, which is consistent.

Therefore, our values for x, y, z are:

x = 2^(1/12) * y

y = 2^(1/3) * x * z

z = 2^(-5/12)

But we already found x, y, z in terms of each other. Let me see if I can express all variables in terms of z or something else. Wait, from equation 3, z = xy * 2^(1/4). If we can express x and y in terms of z, then maybe substitute into this equation.

Alternatively, since we have x = 2^(1/12) * y, and z is known in terms of y? Wait, maybe let's substitute x in terms of y into the expression for z.

From z = xy * 2^(1/4), and x = 2^(1/12) * y, so:

z = (2^(1/12) * y) * y * 2^(1/4) = 2^(1/12 + 1/4) * y^2

Compute 1/12 + 1/4 = 1/12 + 3/12 = 4/12 = 1/3

So z = 2^(1/3) * y^2

But we already found z = 2^(-5/12). Therefore:

2^(1/3) * y^2 = 2^(-5/12)

Divide both sides by 2^(1/3):

y^2 = 2^(-5/12 - 1/3) = 2^(-5/12 - 4/12) = 2^(-9/12) = 2^(-3/4)

Therefore, y = 2^(-3/8)

Since y is positive, we take the positive root.

Now, from x = 2^(1/12) * y = 2^(1/12) * 2^(-3/8) = 2^(1/12 - 3/8)

Convert to common denominator: 1/12 = 2/24, 3/8 = 9/24. So 2/24 - 9/24 = -7/24

Therefore, x = 2^(-7/24)

Wait, but earlier we had z = 2^(-5/12) and x = 2^(1/12) * y, which is 2^(1/12) * 2^(-3/8) = 2^(-7/24). Let me check if these values satisfy the product x * y * z.
</execution_4.3>
</Execution_4>

<Plan_5>
Based on execution_4.3:
x = 2^(-7/24)

y = 2^(-3/8) = 2^(-9/24)

z = 2^(-5/12) = 2^(-10/24)

So product x * y * z = 2^(-7/24 -9/24 -10/24) = 2^(-26/24) = 2^(-13/12), which matches our earlier result. Good.

So now, we have:

<prompt_5.1> Verify the values of x, y, and z by checking if they satisfy all three original logarithmic equations. </prompt_5.1>
</Plan_5>

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
x = 2^(-7/24)

y = 2^(-9/24)

z = 2^(-10/24)

Simplify exponents:

x = 2^(-7/24)

y = 2^(-3/8) = 2^(-9/24)

z = 2^(-5/12) = 2^(-10/24)

So these are the values of x, y, z. Let me check if they satisfy the original equations.

First equation: log₂(x/(yz)) = 1/2

Compute x/(yz):

x = 2^(-7/24)

yz = y * z = 2^(-9/24) * 2^(-10/24) = 2^(-19/24)

So x/(yz) = 2^(-7/24) / 2^(-19/24) = 2^(12/24) = 2^(1/2). Then log₂(2^(1/2)) = 1/2. That works.

Second equation: log₂(y/(xz)) = 1/3

Compute y/(xz):

y = 2^(-9/24)

xz = x * z = 2^(-7/24) * 2^(-10/24) = 2^(-17/24)

So y/(xz) = 2^(-9/24) / 2^(-17/24) = 2^(8/24) = 2^(1/3). Then log₂(2^(1/3)) = 1/3. Correct.

Third equation: log₂(z/(xy)) = 1/4

Compute z/(xy):

z = 2^(-10/24)

xy = x * y = 2^(-7/24) * 2^(-9/24) = 2^(-16/24) = 2^(-2/3)

So z/(xy) = 2^(-10/24) / 2^(-16/24) = 2^(6/24) = 2^(1/4). Then log₂(2^(1/4)) = 1/4. Correct.

All three equations are satisfied. Good.

Based on execution_5.1:
Now, the problem asks for |log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2)|. Let's compute x^4 y^3 z^2 first.

<prompt_6.1> Compute x^4 y^3 z^2 using the values of x, y, and z, and find the absolute value of its logarithm base 2. </prompt_6.1>
</Plan_6>

<Execution_6>
<execution_6.1>
Express each term in terms of powers of 2:

x = 2^(-7/24) ⇒ x^4 = 2^(-7/24 * 4) = 2^(-7/6)

y = 2^(-9/24) ⇒ y^3 = 2^(-9/24 * 3) = 2^(-27/24) = 2^(-9/8)

z = 2^(-10/24) ⇒ z^2 = 2^(-10/24 * 2) = 2^(-20/24) = 2^(-5/6)

Multiply them together:

x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6) = 2^(-7/6 - 9/8 - 5/6)

Compute the exponents:

First, combine -7/6 and -5/6: -7/6 -5/6 = -12/6 = -2

Then add -9/8: -2 -9/8 = -2 -1.125 = -3.125 = -25/8

Wait, let me do it step by step.

Convert all to eighths:

-7/6 = -28/24

-9/8 = -27/24

-5/6 = -20/24

Wait, but maybe better to convert to a common denominator. Let's use 24.

-7/6 = -28/24

-9/8 = -27/24

-5/6 = -20/24

So total exponent: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -25/8

Therefore, x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^(-25/8)

Then log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2) = log₂(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8

The absolute value is | -25/8 | = 25/8

So m = 25, n = 8. They are coprime since 25 and 8 share no common factors besides 1. Therefore, m + n = 25 + 8 = 33.

</Execution_6>

<Plan_7>
Based on execution_6.1:
Therefore, the value of |log₂(x^4y^3z^2)| is 25/8, so m + n is 33.
</Plan_7>

<Execution_7>
No prompt to execute.
</Execution_7>

<Final_answer>
Thus, the final answer is \boxed{33}.
