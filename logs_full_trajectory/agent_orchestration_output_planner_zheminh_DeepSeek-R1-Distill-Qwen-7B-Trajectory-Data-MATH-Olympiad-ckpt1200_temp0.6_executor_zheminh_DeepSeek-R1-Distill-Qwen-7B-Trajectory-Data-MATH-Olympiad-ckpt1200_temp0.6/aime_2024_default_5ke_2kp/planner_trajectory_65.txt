<Question>
Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.
</Question>

<think>
<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to find the distance from the incenter of a tetrahedron to each of its faces. The tetrahedron has all pairs of opposite edges equal: AB=CD=√41, AC=BD=√80, and BC=AD=√89. The distance is supposed to be in the form m√n/p, and then I need to find m+n+p. Alright, let's start breaking this down.

First, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the incenter is the point equidistant from all four faces, and that distance is called the inradius. The formula for the inradius r is given by r = 3V/S, where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area.

So, my plan is to calculate the volume V and the total surface area S of the tetrahedron, then compute r = 3V/S.

But first, how do I compute the volume of this tetrahedron? Since all opposite edges are equal, this might be a special kind of tetrahedron. Maybe it's a disphenoid? I think a disphenoid is a tetrahedron where all opposite edges are equal. So, yes, this is a disphenoid.

<prompt_1.1> Determine the type of tetrahedron and plan to compute the volume using the formula for a disphenoid. </prompt_1.1>
-----

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to use coordinates. Let me try that approach to verify.

Let me place the tetrahedron in coordinate space. Let me assign coordinates to the vertices such that the centroid is at the origin, but perhaps that's complicating.

Alternatively, since it's a disphenoid, maybe I can use a coordinate system where the vertices are symmetric.

Let me denote the coordinates as follows:

Let’s suppose that the tetrahedron has vertices A, B, C, D. Since opposite edges are equal, maybe we can set coordinates such that the midpoints of the opposite edges are at the origin. Wait, in a disphenoid, the midpoints of the two skew edges (the ones that don't intersect) coincide at the centroid.

<prompt_1.2> Compare the two approaches and decide to proceed with the volume formula for a disphenoid. </prompt_1.2>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
For a disphenoid, there's a formula for the volume in terms of the edge lengths. Let me recall.

I think the volume of a disphenoid can be calculated using the formula:

V = (sqrt((a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²)))/72

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I need to look up the formula for the volume of a disphenoid. Wait, but since I can't actually look things up, I need to derive it.

Alternatively, maybe using the Cayley-Menger determinant. That's a general formula for the volume of a tetrahedron given all its edge lengths. Since the tetrahedron is a disphenoid, maybe the Cayley-Menger determinant would simplify.
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
Wait, maybe not. Let me recall: in a disphenoid, the three pairs of opposite edges are equal, and the tetrahedron is isohedral (all faces congruent) only if it's a regular tetrahedron. But in this case, the edges are not all equal, so it's not regular. However, since all opposite edges are equal, it's a disphenoid.

For a disphenoid, there is a formula for the volume in terms of the edge lengths. Let me see if I can recall or derive it.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the Cayley-Menger determinant, which allows computing the volume given all edge lengths. Since we have all edge lengths, that might be a way to go.
</execution_1.2>
</Execution_1>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is given by:

V = sqrt( |CM| / 288 ), where CM is the determinant of the following matrix:

Based on execution_1.2:
Let me recall the formula. The Cayley-Menger determinant for four points in 3D space is a determinant of a 5x5 matrix. The determinant is:

| 0 1 1 1 1 |

| 1 0 a² b² c² |

| 1 a² 0 d² e² |

| 1 b² d² 0 f² |

| 1 c² e² f² 0 |

<prompt_2.2> Write down the Cayley-Menger determinant for the given tetrahedron and simplify the determinant. </prompt_2.2>

0   1    1    1    1

1   0   a²  b²  c²

1  a²   0   d²  e²

1  b²  d²   0   f²

1  c²  e²  f²   0
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
The volume is sqrt( |CM| / 288 ). So, in our case, the edges are given as AB=CD=√41, AC=BD=√80, BC=AD=√89. Let me assign labels to the edges:

Let’s denote:

AB = CD = √41

AC = BD = √80

BC = AD = √89

So, edges:

AB = √41

AC = √80

AD = √89

BC = √89

BD = √80

CD = √41

So, in terms of the Cayley-Menger matrix:

The matrix is:

Row 0: 0 1 1 1 1

Row 1: 1 0 AB² AC² AD²

Row 2: 1 AB² 0 BC² BD²

Row 3: 1 AC² BC² 0 CD²

Row 4: 1 AD² BD² CD² 0

Plugging in the values:

AB² = 41, AC² = 80, AD² = 89

BC² = 89, BD² = 80, CD² = 41

So, the matrix becomes:

Row 0: 0 1 1 1 1

Row 1: 1 0 41 80 89

Row 2: 1 41 0 89 80

Row 3: 1 80 89 0 41

Row 4: 1 89 80 41 0

Now, compute the determinant of this 5x5 matrix. That seems a bit involved, but maybe there's some symmetry we can exploit.

Looking at the matrix, it's symmetric in certain ways. For example, rows 2 and 3 are similar, and columns 2 and 3 are similar. Similarly, rows 1 and 4 might have some symmetry. Let me check:

Row 1: [1, 0, 41, 80, 89]

Row 2: [1, 41, 0, 89, 80]

Row 3: [1, 80, 89, 0, 41]

Row 4: [1, 89, 80, 41, 0]

Hmm, so each row after the first is a permutation of the previous ones. For example, row 2 is row 1 with the elements 41, 80, 89 permuted. Similarly, row 3 is row 2 with elements permuted, and so on. This suggests that the matrix might have some cyclic symmetry.

Given the symmetry, perhaps the determinant can be simplified. However, computing a 5x5 determinant by hand is tedious. Maybe there's a formula specific to disphenoids that can be used here.

Alternatively, since the tetrahedron is a disphenoid, maybe we can use a formula that relates the volume to the edge lengths.
</execution_2.2>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
First, we need to plug in the edge lengths. Let me note down the edges:

Given:

AB = √41, so AB² = 41

AC = √80, so AC² = 80

AD = √89, so AD² = 89

BC = √89, so BC² = 89

BD = √80, so BD² = 80

CD = √41, so CD² = 41

So, substituting into the matrix:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Now, the determinant of this matrix will give us 288V². So, once we compute the determinant, take the square root, divide by 288, and that's the volume.

But calculating a 5x5 determinant is quite involved. Maybe there's a pattern or simplification here.

<prompt_3.1> Compute the determinant of the Cayley-Menger matrix and find the volume. </prompt_3.1>
-----

Based on execution_2.2:
Alternatively, maybe we can use another approach. Let me recall that in a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula:

V = (4/3) * sqrt( (ab - cd)(ac - bd)(ad - bc) ) / 288

Wait, no, that might not be correct. Alternatively, maybe using the formula for a disphenoid with edges a, b, c, a, b, c. Wait, in a disphenoid, the edges come in pairs: AB=CD=a, AC=BD=b, AD=BC=c.

<prompt_3.2> Use the Cayley-Menger determinant to find the volume and then compute the inradius. </prompt_3.2>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
Let me try to compute this determinant step by step.

The determinant of a 5x5 matrix is complex, but perhaps we can use expansion by minors or row operations to simplify.

Alternatively, notice that the matrix is symmetric, so maybe we can exploit some properties. Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that in a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula:

V = (sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) )) / 72

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Wait, maybe that's for a different type of tetrahedron. Let me check.

Wait, I recall that for a tetrahedron with three pairs of opposite edges equal (a disphenoid), the volume can be calculated as V = (sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) )) / 72. Wait, but in that formula, a, b, c are the lengths of the edges? Wait, but in our case, the edges are all different. Wait, no, in a disphenoid, the three pairs of opposite edges are equal. So, perhaps the formula uses the lengths of the three distinct edges. Let me check.

Wait, in our case, the three distinct edge lengths are √41, √80, √89. Let me denote them as a, b, c where a² = 41, b² = 80, c² = 89.

Then, according to the formula, the volume would be V = sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) ) / 72.

Let me compute each term:

First term: a² + b² - c² = 41 + 80 - 89 = (121) - 89 = 32

Second term: a² + c² - b² = 41 + 89 - 80 = 130 - 80 = 50

Third term: b² + c² - a² = 80 + 89 - 41 = 169 - 41 = 128

So, the product is 32 * 50 * 128. Let's compute that:

32 * 50 = 1600

1600 * 128 = 204800

So, the square root of 204800 is sqrt(204800). Let's factorize 204800:

204800 = 2048 * 100 = 2^11 * 2^2 * 5^2 = 2^13 * 5^2

So, sqrt(2^13 * 5^2) = 2^(6.5) * 5 = 2^6 * sqrt(2) * 5 = 64 * 5 * sqrt(2) = 320√2

Therefore, V = 320√2 / 72 = (320/72)√2 = (80/18)√2 = (40/9)√2

Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Is this correct?

Wait, but in a disphenoid, the formula is indeed V = sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) ) / 72, where a, b, c are the three distinct edge lengths. So, in this case, the three distinct edges are AB=CD=√41, AC=BD=√80, BC=AD=√89. Therefore, a²=41, b²=80, c²=89. Then, yes, the formula holds.

Therefore, the volume V is sqrt(32 * 50 * 128)/72 = sqrt(204800)/72 = 320√2 /72 = 40√2 /9.

So, V = 40√2 /9.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
So in our case, a=√41, b=√80, c=√89.

Then, the volume of a disphenoid is given by V = (sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) )) / 72.

Wait, let me check this formula. Let me recall that for a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated as:

V = (sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) )) / 72.

Let me verify if this is correct.

Wait, but in general, for a disphenoid, the volume formula is V = (sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) )) / 72. Let me see if this makes sense.

Alternatively, maybe I need to use the formula for a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal. Since all opposite edges are equal, it's a disphenoid, and there is a specific formula.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for a rhombic disphenoid. Wait, a rhombic disphenoid is a disphenoid where all faces are congruent rhombi. But in our case, the edges are not equal, so maybe not. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe using the Cayley-Menger determinant for a disphenoid. Let me try that.

But since the Cayley-Menger determinant is quite involved, perhaps I can compute it step by step.

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that in a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated by V = (4/3) * sqrt( ( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) ) / 72 ). Wait, no, that seems confused.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the volume of a tetrahedron with edges a, b, c, a, b, c (disphenoid). Let me check a reference formula.

Wait, according to some sources, the volume of a disphenoid with edge lengths AB=CD=a, AC=BD=b, AD=BC=c is given by:

V = (4/3) * sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) ) / 72

Wait, that seems inconsistent. Let me check with a simple case. Suppose a = b = c, then it's a regular tetrahedron. Then, the formula should reduce to the volume of a regular tetrahedron with edge length a.

But if a = b = c, then (a² + b² - c²) = a², similarly for the others. So, the product becomes a² * a² * a² = a^6. Then sqrt(a^6) = a^3. Then (4/3) * a^3 / 72 = (4/3)*(a^3)/72 = (4a^3)/(216) = a^3 / 54. But the volume of a regular tetrahedron with edge length a is (a³)/(6√2) ≈ 0.11785a³. However, a³/54 ≈ 0.0185a³, which is way smaller. So that formula can't be correct.

Therefore, my previous formula is wrong. So I need to find the correct formula for the volume of a disphenoid.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the Cayley-Menger determinant. Let me proceed with that.

So, the Cayley-Menger determinant for the given edge lengths is:

| 0 1 1 1 1 |

| 1 0 41 80 89 |

| 1 41 0 89 80 |

| 1 80 89 0 41 |

| 1 89 80 41 0 |

Calculating this determinant. Let's denote this determinant as D. Then, V = sqrt(|D| / 288).

Calculating a 5x5 determinant by hand is time-consuming, but perhaps there's a pattern due to the symmetry.

Looking at the matrix, rows 1-4 have a similar structure. Let me check if rows 1 and 4 are related.

Row 1: [1, 0, 41, 80, 89]

Row 4: [1, 89, 80, 41, 0]

If we reverse the elements of row 1, we get [1, 89, 80, 41, 0], which is exactly row 4. Similarly, row 2 is [1, 41, 0, 89, 80], and row 3 is [1, 80, 89, 0, 41]. So rows 2 and 3 are similar to each other but reversed. Similarly, rows 1 and 4 are reverses of each other.

This suggests that the matrix might have some symmetry that allows for simplification. Let me try to perform row operations to simplify the determinant.

First, note that row 4 is row 1 reversed. Similarly, row 3 is row 2 reversed. Let me subtract row 4 from row 1, and row 3 from row 2, to create zeros.

But before that, maybe expand the determinant by the first row.

But expanding a 5x5 determinant is still a lot. Alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that the determinant is skew-symmetric under certain permutations. Wait, but skew-symmetric would mean the determinant is zero, which isn't the case here. Hmm.

Alternatively, note that the matrix is symmetric except for the first row and column. Let me check the transpose of the matrix:

The transpose of the matrix would have the same first row and column as the original, and the other rows would be reversed. For example, row 2 of the original is [1, 41, 0, 89, 80], so row 2 of the transpose would be [1, 41, 0, 89, 80], same as original. Wait, no. Wait, the transpose would swap rows and columns. Let me check:

Original matrix:

Row 0: 0 1 1 1 1

Row 1: 1 0 41 80 89

Row 2: 1 41 0 89 80

Row 3: 1 80 89 0 41

Row 4: 1 89 80 41 0

Transposed matrix:

Column 0: 0,1,1,1,1

Column 1:1,0,41,80,89

Column 2:1,41,0,89,80

Column 3:1,80,89,0,41

Column 4:1,89,80,41,0

Comparing to the original rows:

Original Row 1: 1,0,41,80,89

Original Row 2:1,41,0,89,80

Original Row 3:1,80,89,0,41

Original Row 4:1,89,80,41,0

So, the transposed matrix is the original matrix with the first row and column preserved, and the remaining rows are reversed. Therefore, the determinant of the transposed matrix is the same as the original determinant. Therefore, the matrix is symmetric in some way, but not fully symmetric.

<execution_4.1>
Suppose a = b = c = k. Then, the volume should be (k³)/(6√2). Let's see what the formula gives:

V = sqrt( (k² + k² - k²)(k² + k² - k²)(k² + k² - k²) ) / 72 = sqrt( (k²)(k²)(k²) ) / 72 = sqrt(k^6)/72 = k³ / 72. But this contradicts the known formula. Therefore, the formula must be incorrect.

Therefore, the formula I thought of is wrong. So, my previous calculation is incorrect.

Therefore, the Cayley-Menger determinant approach is necessary here.
</execution_4.1>

<execution_4.2>
Suppose a = b = c = 1. Then, the volume should be the volume of a regular tetrahedron with edge length 1, which is sqrt(2)/12 ≈ 0.11785. However, using the formula V = sqrt( (1 + 1 - 1)(1 + 1 - 1)(1 + 1 - 1) ) / 72 = sqrt(1*1*1)/72 = 1/72 ≈ 0.01389, which is not the same as the regular tetrahedron volume. Therefore, the formula is incorrect. So, that formula must be wrong.

Therefore, I must have made a mistake in recalling the formula. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is V = (4/3) * sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) ) / 72. Wait, but in that case, with a = b = c, we get (4/3) * sqrt(1*1*1) / 72 = (4/3)/72 = 1/54 ≈ 0.0185, which is still not the correct volume for a regular tetrahedron. So, that's not correct either.

Hmm, maybe I need to derive the volume using another method. Let me try to use the Cayley-Menger determinant for this specific case.
</execution_4.2>
</Execution_4>

<Plan_5>
Based on execution_4.2:
Let me try to compute the determinant step by step. Let's denote the determinant as D. The Cayley-Menger determinant for these edge lengths is:

| 0 1 1 1 1 |

| 1 0 41 80 89 |

| 1 41 0 89 80 |

| 1 80 89 0 41 |

| 1 89 80 41 0 |

Calculating this determinant. One approach is to perform row operations to simplify the determinant.

First, let's subtract row 4 from row 1. That is, row1_new = row1 - row4.

<prompt_5.1> Perform row operations to simplify the Cayley-Menger determinant and calculate the determinant step-by-step. </prompt_5.1>
</Plan_5>

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
Similarly, subtract row 3 from row 2. Let's perform these operations:

Row1: [1 - 1, 0 - 89, 41 - 80, 80 - 41, 89 - 0] = [0, -89, -39, 39, 89]

Row2: [1 - 1, 41 - 89, 0 - 80, 89 - 41, 80 - 0] = [0, -48, -80, 48, 80]

Row3 remains the same: [1, 80, 89, 0, 41]

Row4 remains the same: [1, 89, 80, 41, 0]

Row0 remains the same: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Now, the determinant becomes:

| 0  1    1     1     1   |

| 0 -89 -39   39   89   |

| 0 -48 -80   48   80   |

| 1  80  89    0    41   |

| 1  89  80   41     0   |

Now, the determinant can be expanded along the first column, which has two zeros. The determinant is the sum of the elements multiplied by their cofactors. The first column has entries 0, 0, 0, 1, 1. So, expanding along the first column:

det = 0 * C00 + 0 * C10 + 0 * C20 + 1 * C30 + 1 * C40

Where C30 is the cofactor of element in row 3, column 0, and C40 is the cofactor of element in row 4, column 0.

C30 = (-1)^(3+0) * det(minor30) = (-1)^3 * det( submatrix obtained by removing row 3 and column 0 )

Similarly, C40 = (-1)^(4+0) * det(minor40) = (-1)^4 * det( submatrix obtained by removing row 4 and column 0 )

Let's compute C30:

Minor30 is the submatrix:

Row0: [1, 1, 1, 1]

Row1: [-89, -39, 39, 89]

Row2: [-48, -80, 48, 80]

Row4: [80, 89, 0, 41]

Wait, no. Wait, the minor for element (3,0) is the submatrix obtained by removing row 3 and column 0. The original rows are 0,1,2,4. The original columns are 1,2,3,4 (since column 0 is removed).

So, the minor30 submatrix is:

Row0: [1, 1, 1, 1]

Row1: [-89, -39, 39, 89]

Row2: [-48, -80, 48, 80]

Row4: [80, 89, 0, 41]

Similarly, minor40 submatrix is obtained by removing row 4 and column 0:

Rows 0,1,2,3 and columns 1,2,3,4:

Row0: [1, 1, 1, 1]

Row1: [-89, -39, 39, 89]

Row2: [-48, -80, 48, 80]

Row3: [1, 80, 89, 0]

Therefore, C30 = (-1)^3 * det(minor30) = -det(minor30)

C40 = (-1)^4 * det(minor40) = det(minor40)

Therefore, det = 1*(-det(minor30)) + 1*(det(minor40)) = det(minor40) - det(minor30)

So, we need to compute det(minor40) - det(minor30).

Let's compute det(minor30) first.

Minor30:

Row0: [1, 1, 1, 1]

Row1: [-89, -39, 39, 89]

Row2: [-48, -80, 48, 80]

Row3: [1, 80, 89, 0]

Let me compute the determinant of minor30. Let's denote the matrix as M1:

M1 = 

[1, 1, 1, 1]

[-89, -39, 39, 89]

[-48, -80, 48, 80]

[1, 80, 89, 0]

Compute det(M1). Let's perform row operations to simplify.

First, subtract row 0 from rows 1, 2, and 3 to eliminate the first column entries.

Row1_new = Row1 - Row0: [-89 -1, -39 -1, 39 -1, 89 -1] = [-90, -40, 38, 88]

Row2_new = Row2 - Row0: [-48 -1, -80 -1, 48 -1, 80 -1] = [-49, -81, 47, 79]

Row3_new = Row3 - Row0: [1 -1, 80 -1, 89 -1, 0 -1] = [0, 79, 88, -1]

So, the matrix becomes:

Row0: [1, 1, 1, 1]

Row1: [-90, -40, 38, 88]

Row2: [-49, -81, 47, 79]

Row3: [0, 79, 88, -1]

Now, expand along the first column. The determinant will be:

1 * det( submatrix without row0, column0 )

The submatrix is:

[ -90, -40, 38, 88 ]

[ -49, -81, 47, 79 ]

[ 0, 79, 88, -1 ]

Compute this determinant. Let's denote this as M1a.

M1a:

| -90  -40   38   88 |

| -49  -81   47   79 |

| 0    79   88  -1  |

Let me compute this determinant.

We can expand along the third row since it has a zero, which might simplify calculations.

Expanding along the third row (row index 2):

det(M1a) = 0 * C20 + 79 * C21 + 88 * C22 + (-1) * C23

Where C21 is the cofactor for element (2,1), C22 for (2,2), C23 for (2,3).

C21 = (-1)^(2+1) * det(minor21)

C22 = (-1)^(2+2) * det(minor22)

C23 = (-1)^(2+3) * det(minor23)

Compute each minor:

Minor21: remove row 2, column 1:

[ -90, 38, 88 ]

[ -49, 47, 79 ]

[ 0, 88, -1 ]

Minor22: remove row 2, column 2:

[ -90, -40, 88 ]

[ -49, -81, 79 ]

[ 0, 79, -1 ]

Minor23: remove row 2, column 3:

[ -90, -40, 38 ]

[ -49, -81, 47 ]

[ 0, 79, 88 ]

Compute det(minor21):

| -90  38   88 |

| -49  47   79 |

| 0    88  -1 |

Compute this determinant:

det = -90*(47*(-1) - 79*88) - 38*(-49*(-1) - 79*0) + 88*(-49*88 - 47*0)

Calculate each term:

First term: -90*( -47 - 6952 ) = -90*(-6999) = 90*6999 = 629,910

Second term: -38*(49 - 0) = -38*49 = -1,862

Third term: 88*( -4312 - 0 ) = 88*(-4312) = -379,  88*4312=379, 88*4000=352,000, 88*312=27,  88*312=27,  so total 352,000 + 27,  = 352,272? Wait, 88*312: 80*312=24,960, 8*312=2,496, total 24,960 + 2,496 = 27,456. So, 88*(-4312) = -27,456*100? Wait, 88*4312: 4312*80=344,960, 4312*8=34,496, total 344,960 + 34,496 = 379,456. Therefore, 88*(-4312) = -379,456.

Therefore, det(minor21) = 629,910 - 1,862 - 379,456 = 629,910 - 381,318 = 248,592

Wait, let's compute step by step:

First term: 90*6999 = 90*(7000 -1) = 630,000 -90 = 629,910

Second term: -38*49 = -1,862

Third term: 88*(-4312) = -379,456

So total: 629,910 -1,862 -379,456 = 629,910 - 381,318 = 248,592

So det(minor21) = 248,592

Then, C21 = (-1)^3 * 248,592 = -248,592

Next, det(minor22):

| -90  -40   88 |

| -49  -81   79 |

| 0    79  -1  |

Compute this determinant. Let's expand along the third row since it has a zero.

det = 0*C30 + 79*C31 + (-1)*C32

Where C31 is the cofactor for (3,1), C32 for (3,2).

C31 = (-1)^(3+1) * det(minor31) = det(minor31)

C32 = (-1)^(3+2) * det(minor32) = -det(minor32)

Minor31: remove row3, column1:

[ -90, 88 ]

[ -49, 79 ]

[ 0, -1 ]

Wait, no. Wait, removing row3 (index 2) and column1 (index0), the remaining elements are:

Row0: [ -90, -40, 88 ]

Row1: [ -49, -81, 79 ]

Row2: [ 0, 79, -1 ]

So, minor31 is:

[ -90, 88 ]

[ -49, 79 ]

[ 0, -1 ]

Wait, no. Wait, the original matrix is:

Row0: [ -90, -40, 88 ]

Row1: [ -49, -81, 79 ]

Row2: [ 0, 79, -1 ]

So, minor31 (removing column1) is:

[ -90, 88 ]

[ -49, 79 ]

[ 0, -1 ]

Wait, but we need to remove column1, so the columns are 0 and 2. So, the minor31 is:

Row0: [ -90, 88 ]

Row1: [ -49, 79 ]

Row2: [ 0, -1 ]

Therefore, det(minor31) = (-90)(79) - (88)(-49) = (-7110) + 4312 = -2798

Therefore, C31 = det(minor31) = -2798

Minor32: remove row3, column2:

[ -90, -40, 88 ]

[ -49, -81, 79 ]

[ 0, 79, -1 ]

Wait, removing column2, so the columns are 0 and 1. So, minor32 is:

Row0: [ -90, -40 ]

Row1: [ -49, -81 ]

Row2: [ 0, 79 ]

Compute det(minor32):

= (-90)(-81) - (-40)(-49) = 7290 - 1960 = 5330

Therefore, C32 = -det(minor32) = -5330

Therefore, det(minor22) = 79*(-2798) + (-1)*(-5330) = -219,  79*2798: 70*2798=195,860, 9*2798=25,182, total 221,042. So, -221,042 + 5,330 = -215,712

Wait, let's compute step by step:

79*(-2798) = -79*2798. Let's compute 70*2798=195,860, 9*2798=25,182, total 195,860 +25,182=221,042. So, 79*(-2798)= -221,042

Then, (-1)*(-5330)=5,330

So, det(minor22) = -221,042 +5,330 = -215,712

Therefore, C22 = det(minor22) = -215,712

Now, det(minor23):

| -90  -40   38 |

| -49  -81   47 |

| 0    79   88 |

Compute this determinant. Let's expand along the third row (since it has a zero).

det = 0*C30 + 79*C31 + 88*C32

C31 = (-1)^(3+1) * det(minor31)

C32 = (-1)^(3+2) * det(minor32)

Minor31: remove row3, column1:

[ -90, 38 ]

[ -49, 47 ]

[ 0, 88 ]

Wait, no. Wait, removing row3 and column1:

Original matrix for det(minor23):

[ -90, -40, 38 ]

[ -49, -81, 47 ]

[ 0, 79, 88 ]

So, removing row3 (index2) and column1 (index0), the minor31 is:

[ -90, 38 ]

[ -49, 47 ]

Similarly, minor32 is removing column2:

[ -90, -40 ]

[ -49, -81 ]

[ 0, 79 ]

Compute det(minor31):

= (-90)(47) - (38)(-49) = -4,170 + 1,862 = -2,308

C31 = det(minor31) = -2,308

Minor32: remove row3, column2:

[ -90, -40 ]

[ -49, -81 ]

[ 0, 79 ]

Compute det(minor32):

= (-90)(-81) - (-40)(-49) = 7,290 - 1,960 = 5,330

C32 = det(minor32) = 5,330

Therefore, det(minor23) = 79*(-2,308) + 88*(5,330)

Compute step by step:

79*(-2,308) = -79*2,308. Let's compute 70*2,308 = 161,560, 9*2,308=20,772, total 161,560 +20,772=182,332. So, -79*2,308 = -182,332

88*5,330 = 88*5,000 +88*330 = 440,000 +29,040 = 469,040

Therefore, det(minor23) = -182,332 +469,040 = 286,708

Therefore, det(minor23) = 286,708

Thus, C23 = det(minor23) = 286,708

Therefore, det(M1a) = 79*(-2798) + 88*(-5330) + (-1)*(286,708)

Compute each term:

79*(-2798) = -219,  79*2798=219,  79*2000=158,000; 79*700=55,300; 79*98=7,742. So total 158,000 +55,300 +7,742=221,042. Therefore, -219,042

88*(-5330) = -469,  88*5330=469,  88*5000=440,000; 88*330=29,040. Total 440,000 +29,040=469,040. So, -469,040

(-1)*(286,708) = -286,708

So, det(M1a) = -219,042 -469,040 -286,708 = -(219,042 +469,040 +286,708) = -(974,790)

Wait, let's add them:

219,042 +469,040 = 688,082

688,082 +286,708 = 974,790

Thus, det(M1a) = -974,790

Therefore, det(minor30) = det(M1a) = -974,790

Now, compute det(minor40):

Minor40 is the submatrix obtained by removing row4 and column0:

Rows0,1,2,3 and columns1,2,3,4:

Row0: [1, 1, 1, 1]

Row1: [-89, -39, 39, 89]

Row2: [-48, -80, 48, 80]

Row3: [1, 80, 89, 0]

Compute det(minor40). Let's denote this as M2:

M2 = 

[1, 1, 1, 1]

[-89, -39, 39, 89]

[-48, -80, 48, 80]

[1, 80, 89, 0]

Again, perform row operations to simplify. Let's subtract row0 from rows1, 2, 3.

Row1_new = Row1 - Row0: [-89 -1, -39 -1, 39 -1, 89 -1] = [-90, -40, 38, 88]

Row2_new = Row2 - Row0: [-48 -1, -80 -1, 48 -1, 80 -1] = [-49, -81, 47, 79]

Row3_new = Row3 - Row0: [1 -1, 80 -1, 89 -1, 0 -1] = [0, 79, 88, -1]

So, M2 becomes:

Row0: [1, 1, 1, 1]

Row1: [-90, -40, 38, 88]

Row2: [-49, -81, 47, 79]

Row3: [0, 79, 88, -1]

Now, expand along the first column. The determinant is:

1 * det( submatrix obtained by removing row0, column0 )

Submatrix:

[ -90, -40, 38, 88 ]

[ -49, -81, 47, 79 ]

[ 0, 79, 88, -1 ]

Compute this determinant. Let's denote this as M2a.

M2a:

| -90  -40   38   88 |

| -49  -81   47   79 |

| 0    79   88  -1  |

Compute det(M2a). Let's expand along the third row (row3) since it has a zero.

det(M2a) = 0*C30 +79*C31 +88*C32 + (-1)*C33

C30 = (-1)^(3+1) * det(minor30)

C31 = (-1)^(3+2) * det(minor31)

C32 = (-1)^(3+3) * det(minor32)

C33 = (-1)^(3+4) * det(minor33)

Compute minors:

Minor30: remove row3, column0:

[ -90, -40, 38 ]

[ -49, -81, 47 ]

[ 0, 79, 88 ]

Compute det(minor30):

= -90*( -81*88 -47*79 ) - (-40)*( -49*88 -47*0 ) + 38*( -49*79 - (-81)*0 )

Compute each term:

First term: -90*( -81*88 -47*79 )

Compute -81*88: -81*80= -6480, -81*8= -648, total -6480 -648= -7128

47*79: 47*80=3,760 -47=3,713

So, -81*88 -47*79 = -7128 -3,713 = -10,841

Therefore, first term: -90*(-10,841) = 90*10,841 = 975,690

Second term: -(-40)*( -49*88 -0 ) = 40*( -49*88 ) = 40*(-4,312) = -172,480

Third term: 38*( -49*79 -0 ) = 38*(-3,871) = -147,  38*3,871. Let's compute 38*3,000=114,000; 38*871=32,  38*800=30,400, 38*71=2,698. So, 30,400 +2,698=33,098. Therefore, 114,000 +33,098=147,098. So, 38*(-3,871)= -147,098

Therefore, det(minor30) = 975,690 -172,480 -147,098 = 975,690 - 319,578 = 656,112

C30 = det(minor30) = 656,112

Minor31: remove row3, column1:

[ -90, 38, 88 ]

[ -49, 47, 79 ]

[ 0, 88, -1 ]

Compute det(minor31):

= -90*(47*(-1) -79*88 ) -38*( -49*(-1) -79*0 ) +88*( -49*88 -47*0 )

Compute each term:

First term: -90*( -47 -79*88 )

Compute 79*88: 70*88=6,160; 9*88=792; total 6,160 +792=6,952. So, -47 -6,952= -6,999

Thus, first term: -90*(-6,999)=90*6,999=629,910

Second term: -38*(49 -0 )= -38*49= -1,862

Third term:88*( -49*88 -0 )=88*(-4,312)= -379,  88*4,000=352,000; 88*312=27,  88*300=26,400; 88*12=1,056. So, 26,400 +1,056=27,456. So, 352,000 +27,456=379,456. Therefore, 88*(-4,312)= -379,456

Therefore, det(minor31) = 629,910 -1,862 -379,456 = 629,910 -381,318 = 248,592

C31 = -det(minor31) = -248,592

Minor32: remove row3, column2:

[ -90, -40, 88 ]

[ -49, -81, 79 ]

[ 0, 79, -1 ]

Compute det(minor32):

= -90*(-81*(-1) -79*79 ) - (-40)*( -49*(-1) -79*0 ) +88*( -49*79 - (-81)*0 )

Compute each term:

First term: -90*(81 -6,241 ) = -90*(-6,160 )=554,400

Second term: -(-40)*(49 -0 )=40*49=1,960

Third term:88*(-49*79 -0 )=88*(-3,871)= -339,  88*3,000=264,000; 88*871=76,  88*800=70,400; 88*71=6,  88*70=6,160; 88*1=88. So, 70,400 +6,160 +88=76,648. Therefore, 88*(-3,871)= -339,  264,000 +76,648=340,648. So, 88*(-3,871)= -340,648

Therefore, det(minor32) = 554,400 +1,960 -340,648 = 554,400 +1,960=556,360 -340,648=215,712

C32 = det(minor32) =215,712

Minor33: remove row3, column3:

[ -90, -40, 38 ]

[ -49, -81, 47 ]

[0, 79, 88 ]

Compute det(minor33):

= -90*(-81*88 -47*79 ) - (-40)*( -49*88 -47*0 ) +38*( -49*79 - (-81)*0 )

Compute each term:

First term: -90*( -7,  81*88=7,128; 47*79=3,713; so -7,128 -3,713= -10,841. So, -90*(-10,841)=90*10,841=975, 690

Second term: -(-40)*( -49*88 -0 )=40*( -4,312 )= -172,480

Third term:38*( -49*79 -0 )=38*(-3,871)= -147,  38*3,871=147,  38*3,000=114,000; 38*871=33,098. So, total 114,000 +33,098=147,098. Therefore, 38*(-3,871)= -147,098

Therefore, det(minor33) =975,690 -172,480 -147,098 =975,690 -319,578=656,112

C33 = det(minor33) =656,112

Thus, det(M2a) =79*(-2798) +88*(-5330) + (-1)*(656,112)

Compute each term:

79*(-2798)= -219,  79*2798=219,  70*2798=195,860; 9*2798=25,182. Total 195,860 +25,182=221,042. So, -221,042

88*(-5330)= -469,  88*5330=469,  80*5330=426,400; 8*5330=42,640. Total 426,400 +42,640=469,040. So, -469,040

(-1)*656,112= -656,112

Therefore, det(M2a)= -221,042 -469,040 -656,112 = -(221,042 +469,040 +656,112) = -(1,346,194)

Thus, det(M2a)= -1,346,194

Therefore, det(minor40)=det(M2a)= -1,346,194

Therefore, det(minor40)= -1,346,194

Therefore, det(minor40)= -1,346,194

Therefore, going back:

det(minor30) = -974,790

det(minor40)= -1,346,194

Therefore, det(minor40) - det(minor30) = (-1,346,194) - (-974,790) = -1,346,194 +974,790 = -371,404

Therefore, det(minor40) - det(minor30) = -371,404

Therefore, det(C30) = det(minor40) - det(minor30) = -371,404

Therefore, the determinant of the Cayley-M
