Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$.

Okay, so I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box with surface area 54 and volume 23. Then, I have to find r squared expressed as a fraction p/q, where p and q are coprime, and finally compute p+q. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem.

<prompt_1.1> Read and understand the problem statement. Set up the problem by defining variables for the dimensions of the rectangular box and writing down the expressions for surface area and volume. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
First, the problem is about a rectangular box, which has length, width, and height. Let's denote them as x, y, z. The surface area of a rectangular box is given by 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54, and the volume is xyz = 23. The sphere that can contain the box must have a radius equal to the maximum distance from the center of the box to any of its vertices. Since the sphere must contain the entire box, the radius r is half of the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal of a rectangular box is sqrt(x² + y² + z²), so r = (1/2)sqrt(x² + y² + z²), which means r² = (x² + y² + z²)/4. Therefore, I need to find the maximum possible value of x² + y² + z² given the constraints of surface area and volume, and then divide that by 4 to get r².

Wait, but the problem says "the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of B". So, actually, we need the minimal r such that every box in B is contained in a sphere of radius r. Therefore, r is the supremum (least upper bound) of the minimal enclosing sphere radii over all boxes in B. So, in other words, we need to find the maximum of (1/2)*sqrt(x² + y² + z²) over all boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23. Then, r² is that maximum value divided by 4. Therefore, the key is to maximize x² + y² + z² given that 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 and xyz = 23.

So, the problem reduces to maximizing x² + y² + z² given those two constraints. Let me think about how to approach this. I remember that in optimization problems with constraints, Lagrange multipliers are often used. Maybe I should try that method here.

<prompt_2.1> Set up the Lagrangian function for the optimization problem of maximizing x² + y² + z² subject to the constraints 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 and xyz = 23. </prompt_2.1>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Let me recall that. The idea is to introduce Lagrange multipliers for each constraint and set up the equations accordingly. Let's denote the function to maximize as f(x,y,z) = x² + y² + z², and the constraints as g(x,y,z) = 2(xy + yz + zx) - 54 = 0 and h(x,y,z) = xyz - 23 = 0. Then, the Lagrangian would be L = f - λg - μh, where λ and μ are the Lagrange multipliers. Taking partial derivatives with respect to x, y, z, λ, μ and setting them to zero gives the system of equations.

So, let's compute the partial derivatives. The partial derivative of L with respect to x is 2x - λ(2(y + z)) - μ(yz) = 0. Similarly, for y: 2y - λ(2(x + z)) - μ(xz) = 0. For z: 2z - λ(2(x + y)) - μ(xy) = 0. Then, the constraints themselves: 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 and xyz = 23. So, we have five equations with five variables x, y, z, λ, μ.

This seems quite involved, but maybe we can find some symmetry or substitute variables. Let's see.

<prompt_3.1> Explore the symmetry of the problem and attempt to find relationships between variables by equating the partial derivative equations and considering equalities between variables. </prompt_3.1>

<execution_3.1>
First, let's note that the problem is symmetric in x, y, z, so perhaps the maximum of x² + y² + z² occurs when two variables are equal? Let me check. If we assume that x = y, does that lead to a solution? Let's try that.

Assume x = y. Then, the surface area equation becomes 2(x² + 2xz) = 54, which simplifies to x² + 2xz = 27. The volume equation is x² z = 23. So, from the volume equation, z = 23 / x². Substitute into the surface area equation: x² + 2x*(23 / x²) = 27 => x² + 46 / x = 27. Multiply both sides by x: x³ + 46 = 27x => x³ - 27x + 46 = 0. Let's try to solve this cubic equation.

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
Let me check if there are any rational roots. By Rational Root Theorem, possible roots are factors of 46 over factors of 1, so ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46. Let's test x=2: 8 - 54 + 46 = 0. 8 -54 is -46, plus 46 is 0. So x=2 is a root. Therefore, we can factor the cubic as (x - 2)(x² + 2x - 23) = 0. The quadratic equation x² + 2x -23 =0 has solutions x = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 ± 4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 ± 2*sqrt(6). Since x is a length, it must be positive. Therefore, the roots are x=2 and x= -1 + 2*sqrt(6) ≈ -1 + 4.898 ≈ 3.898. So, x=2 and x≈3.898. Let's check x=2.

<prompt_4.1> Solve the cubic equation x³ - 27x + 46 = 0 by factoring and check the roots for positivity and feasibility. </prompt_4.1>

So, if x=2, then z=23/(2)^2=23/4=5.75. Then, the space diagonal squared is x² + y² + z² = 4 + 4 + (23/4)^2 = 8 + (529/16) = (128/16 + 529/16) = 657/16. Then, r² would be 657/64 ≈ 10.265625. But wait, is this the maximum? Because we assumed x=y, but maybe there's a case where x, y, z are all different and give a higher x² + y² + z².

Alternatively, maybe the maximum occurs when one of the variables is different from the others. Let's try to see.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use Lagrange multipliers without assuming symmetry. Let's try that approach.

<prompt_4.2> Write down the system of equations from the Lagrangian conditions and attempt to solve it for the variables x, y, z, λ, μ. </prompt_4.2>

Alternatively, maybe we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers with two constraints. Let me recall that for multiple constraints, the gradients of f, g, h must be linearly dependent. So, there exist multipliers λ and μ such that grad f = λ grad g + μ grad h.

<prompt_4.3> Use the Lagrangian conditions to set up equations relating variables x, y, z, λ, μ and consider the possibility of equal variables. </prompt_4.3>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
Then, the space diagonal squared is 2² + 2² + (23/4)^2 = 4 + 4 + 529/16 = 8 + 33.0625 = 41.0625. Then, r² would be 41.0625 / 4 ≈ 10.265625. So, 657/64 is 10.265625. Let's check if this is a candidate.

But wait, maybe there's a larger value when x, y, z are not equal. Let's see. Let's consider another approach. Let's denote S = x + y + z, P = xy + yz + zx, and Q = xyz. Given that 2P = 54, so P = 27, and Q = 23. We need to find the maximum of x² + y² + z². Note that x² + y² + z² = S² - 2P. Since S is not given, but P is known. So, x² + y² + z² = S² - 54. Therefore, to maximize x² + y² + z², we need to maximize S². So, the problem reduces to maximizing (x + y + z)^2 given that xy + yz + zx = 27 and xyz = 23. Hmm, interesting.

So, if we can find the maximum value of S = x + y + z, then S² - 54 will be the maximum x² + y² + z². Therefore, we need to maximize S given that P = 27 and Q = 23. Maybe using inequalities or some optimization techniques here. Let's recall that for positive real numbers, there are certain inequalities that relate S, P, and Q. For example, the AM ≥ GM inequality, but here we have three variables. Alternatively, maybe we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers here as well, but since we already have two constraints, perhaps there's a way to express two variables in terms of the third.

Alternatively, let's consider that given P = 27 and Q = 23, we can think of x, y, z as roots of the cubic equation t³ - St² + Pt - Q = 0, which is t³ - St² + 27t - 23 = 0. The roots of this equation are x, y, z. To maximize S, we need to find the maximum possible value of S such that the cubic equation has three positive real roots. The maximum S would occur when the cubic has a multiple root, because that's when the discriminant is zero, which often corresponds to extremal values in such problems.

So, perhaps we can find the value of S such that the cubic equation t³ - St² + 27t - 23 = 0 has a double root. If there's a double root, say at t = a, then the equation can be written as (t - a)²(t - b) = 0, where b is the third root. Expanding this, we get t³ - (2a + b)t² + (a² + 2ab)t - a²b = 0. Comparing coefficients with the original equation:

<execution_4.2>
The partial derivatives:

For x: 2x - λ(2(y + z)) - μ(yz) = 0

For y: 2y - λ(2(x + z)) - μ(xz) = 0

For z: 2z - λ(2(x + y)) - μ(xy) = 0

So, we have three equations here. Let's denote these as equations (1), (2), (3).

Let me try to subtract equations to eliminate variables. For example, subtract equation (1) from equation (2):

[2y - λ(2(x + z)) - μ(xz)] - [2x - λ(2(y + z)) - μ(yz)] = 0

Simplify:

2y - 2x - λ[2(x + z) - 2(y + z)] - μ(xz - yz) = 0

Factor terms:

2(y - x) - λ[2(x - y)] - μ(z)(x - y) = 0

Factor out (y - x):

(y - x)[2 + 2λ + μ z] = 0

Similarly, subtract equation (2) from equation (3):

[2z - λ(2(x + y)) - μ(xy)] - [2y - λ(2(x + z)) - μ(xz)] = 0

Simplify:

2z - 2y - λ[2(x + y) - 2(x + z)] - μ(xy - xz) = 0

Factor:

2(z - y) - λ[2(y - z)] - μ(x)(y - z) = 0

Factor out (z - y):

(z - y)[2 + 2λ + μ x] = 0

Similarly, subtract equation (1) from equation (3):

[2z - λ(2(x + y)) - μ(xy)] - [2x - λ(2(y + z)) - μ(yz)] = 0

Simplify:

2z - 2x - λ[2(x + y) - 2(y + z)] - μ(xy - yz) = 0

Factor:

2(z - x) - λ[2(x - z)] - μ(y)(x - z) = 0

Factor out (z - x):

(z - x)[2 + 2λ + μ y] = 0

So, all three subtractions lead to the same kind of factorization:

(y - x)[2 + 2λ + μ z] = 0

(z - y)[2 + 2λ + μ x] = 0

(z - x)[2 + 2λ + μ y] = 0

So, either each pair of variables are equal, or the terms in the brackets are zero. Let's consider the case where all variables are equal. Suppose x = y = z. Then, the surface area would be 2(3x²) = 6x² = 54 => x² = 9 => x = 3. Then, volume would be x³ = 27, but the volume is supposed to be 23. So, that's a contradiction. Therefore, x = y = z is not possible. Therefore, we can't have all variables equal.

Therefore, the other possibility is that the terms in the brackets are zero. So,

2 + 2λ + μ z = 0

2 + 2λ + μ x = 0

2 + 2λ + μ y = 0

Therefore, all three expressions are equal:

2 + 2λ + μ z = 2 + 2λ + μ x = 2 + 2λ + μ y = 0

Which implies that μ z = μ x = μ y. If μ ≠ 0, then x = y = z, which we already saw is impossible. Therefore, the only possibility is μ = 0. Then, from the equations above, 2 + 2λ = 0 => λ = -1.

So, if μ = 0, then λ = -1. Let's check if this is possible.

If μ = 0, then the Lagrangian equations become:

For x: 2x - λ*2(y + z) = 0 => 2x - 2λ(y + z) = 0

Similarly for y and z.

But if λ = -1, then:

For x: 2x - 2*(-1)(y + z) = 2x + 2(y + z) = 0 => 2x + 2y + 2z = 0 => x + y + z = 0

But x, y, z are lengths, so they must be positive. Therefore, x + y + z = 0 is impossible. Therefore, this case is invalid.

Therefore, the only possibility is that two variables are equal, and the third is different. Let's suppose that two variables are equal, say x = y ≠ z. Then, we can proceed as before.

Wait, but earlier when we assumed x = y, we found a solution with x=2, z=5.75, but maybe there's another solution where x = z or y = z. Let's check.

Suppose x = z. Then, the surface area equation becomes 2(xy + yx + x²) = 2(2xy + x²) = 54 => 4xy + 2x² = 54 => 2xy + x² = 27. The volume equation is x² y = 23. Let's denote x = z, so we have:

From volume: y = 23 / x²

Substitute into surface area equation:

2x*(23 / x²) + x² = 46 / x + x² = 27

Multiply both sides by x:

46 + x³ = 27x => x³ - 27x + 46 = 0

Wait, this is the same cubic equation as before! So, the roots are x=2 and x≈3.898. So, same solutions. Therefore, if x = z, we get the same x=2 and x≈3.898. So, the maximum x² + y² + z² would be same as before.

Similarly, if we assume y = z, then we would get the same equation. Therefore, the maximum occurs when two variables are equal, and the third is different. Therefore, the maximum x² + y² + z² is 657/16 when x = y = 2 and z = 5.75, or when any two variables are 2 and the third is 23/(2)^2=5.75. Wait, but let me check the other root.

Wait, when x ≈3.898, then z =23/(x²). Let's compute x ≈3.898, so x²≈15.192, so z≈23/15.192≈1.513. Then, the space diagonal squared is x² + y² + z² = x² + x² + z²=2x² + z²≈2*(15.192) + (1.513)^2≈30.384 + 2.289≈32.673. Wait, but when x=2, z=5.75, then x² + y² + z²=4 +4 +33.0625=41.0625. So, 657/16 is 41.0625. Wait, 657 divided by 16: 16*41=656, so 657/16=41.0625. So, that's larger than the other case. Therefore, the maximum x² + y² + z² is 657/16, so r²=657/(16*4)=657/64≈10.265625. Therefore, the answer would be 657/64, which is p/q=657/64, and 657 and 64 are coprime since 657 divided by 64 is 10 with remainder 17, then 64 and 17 are coprime. Therefore, p=657, q=64, so p+q=657+64=721.

But wait, before concluding, I need to make sure that this is indeed the maximum. The problem states that the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the boxes in B. So, we need the supremum of r over all boxes in B. So, if the maximum x² + y² + z² is 657/16, then the minimal enclosing sphere radius is sqrt(657/16)/2 = sqrt(657)/8, so r²=657/64. Therefore, 657 and 64 are coprime, so p+q=721.

But wait, let me verify if there are other cases where x² + y² + z² could be larger. For example, suppose one variable is very large and the others are small, but given that the volume is fixed at 23, you can't have one variable be arbitrarily large. Let's see.

Suppose we fix the volume xyz=23. If we let x approach infinity, then y and z must approach zero such that yz=23/x. Then, the surface area 2(xy + yz + zx)=2x(y + z) +2yz. Since y + z can be written in terms of y and z, but as x approaches infinity, y and z approach zero, but their product is 23/x. So, the surface area would approach 2x(y + z). But y + z >= 2sqrt(yz)=2sqrt(23/x). Therefore, surface area >=2x*2sqrt(23/x)=4sqrt(23x). As x approaches infinity, this tends to infinity. But the problem states that the surface area is fixed at 54. Therefore, such cases are excluded. Therefore, all boxes in B have surface area exactly 54 and volume exactly 23. Therefore, the variables x, y, z are bounded, so x² + y² + z² is bounded above, and we found the maximum at 657/16. Therefore, the answer is 657/64, so p+q=721.

Let's compute the gradients.

grad f = (2x, 2y, 2z)

grad g = (2(y + z), 2(x + z), 2(x + y))

grad h = (yz, xz, xy)

Therefore, the equations are:

2x = λ*2(y + z) + μ*yz

2y = λ*2(x + z) + μ*xz

2z = λ*2(x + y) + μ*xy

So, writing these equations:

Equation 1: x = λ(y + z) + (μ/2) yz

Equation 2: y = λ(x + z) + (μ/2) xz

Equation 3: z = λ(x + y) + (μ/2) xy

Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe we can subtract equations to find relations between variables. Let's subtract Equation 1 and Equation 2:

x - y = λ(y + z - x - z) + (μ/2)(yz - xz)

Simplify:

x - y = λ(y - x) + (μ/2) z(y - x)

Factor out (x - y):

x - y = -λ(x - y) - (μ/2) z(x - y)

Assuming x ≠ y, we can divide both sides by (x - y):

1 = -λ - (μ/2) z

Similarly, subtract Equation 2 - Equation 3:

y - z = λ(x + z - x - y) + (μ/2)(xz - xy)

Simplify:

y - z = λ(z - y) + (μ/2) x(z - y)

Factor out (y - z):

y - z = -λ(y - z) - (μ/2) x(y - z)

Again, assuming y ≠ z, divide both sides by (y - z):

1 = -λ - (μ/2) x

So, from the first subtraction, we have 1 = -λ - (μ/2) z

From the second subtraction, 1 = -λ - (μ/2) x

Therefore, equating the two:

-λ - (μ/2) z = -λ - (μ/2) x

Which implies (μ/2)(z - x) = 0

So, either μ = 0 or z = x.

If μ ≠ 0, then z = x. Similarly, if we subtract other pairs, maybe we can get similar results. Let's try subtracting Equation 1 - Equation 3:

x - z = λ(y + z - x - y) + (μ/2)(yz - xy)

Simplify:

x - z = λ(z - x) + (μ/2)y(z - x)

Factor out (x - z):

x - z = -λ(x - z) - (μ/2)y(x - z)

Assuming x ≠ z, divide both sides by (x - z):

1 = -λ - (μ/2)y

So, now we have three equations:

1 = -λ - (μ/2) z  (from 1-2)

1 = -λ - (μ/2) x  (from 2-3)

1 = -λ - (μ/2)y  (from 1-3)

Therefore, all three expressions are equal to 1. Therefore, we have:

-λ - (μ/2) z = -λ - (μ/2) x = -λ - (μ/2) y

Which implies that (μ/2) z = (μ/2) x = (μ/2) y. Therefore, unless μ = 0, we must have x = y = z. But if μ ≠ 0, then x = y = z. Let's check if this is possible.

If x = y = z, then the surface area would be 2(3x²) = 6x² = 54 => x² = 9 => x = 3. Then volume would be x³ = 27, but the volume is given as 23. So, this is a contradiction. Therefore, the case where x = y = z is impossible. Therefore, the only possibility is that μ = 0. Because otherwise, we would have a contradiction. Therefore, μ = 0.

So, if μ = 0, then the equations simplify. Let's go back to the original Lagrangian equations with μ = 0:

Equation 1: x = λ(y + z)

Equation 2: y = λ(x + z)

Equation 3: z = λ(x + y)

So, now we have three equations:

x = λ(y + z)  (1)

y = λ(x + z)  (2)

z = λ(x + y)  (3)

And we also have the constraints:

2(xy + yz + zx) = 54  (4)

xyz = 23  (5)

So, now we need to solve this system. Let's try to express variables in terms of λ. Let's see if we can find a relationship between x, y, z.

From equation (1): x = λ(y + z)

From equation (2): y = λ(x + z)

From equation (3): z = λ(x + y)

Let me try to express y and z in terms of x. Let's subtract equation (2) from equation (1):

x - y = λ(y + z - x - z) = λ(y - x)

Thus, x - y = λ(y - x) => x - y = -λ(x - y)

So, either x = y or 1 = -λ.

Case 1: x = y.

If x = y, then from equation (1): x = λ(x + z) => x = λx + λz => x(1 - λ) = λz => z = x(1 - λ)/λ

From equation (3): z = λ(2x) => z = 2λx

Therefore, equate the two expressions for z:

x(1 - λ)/λ = 2λx

Cancel x (assuming x ≠ 0):

(1 - λ)/λ = 2λ => 1 - λ = 2λ² => 2λ² + λ - 1 = 0

Solve for λ:

λ = [-1 ± sqrt(1 + 8)] / 4 = [-1 ± 3]/4

So, λ = (-1 + 3)/4 = 0.5 or λ = (-1 - 3)/4 = -1

Case 1a: λ = 0.5

Then, z = 2*0.5x = x. So, z = x. But if x = y and z = x, then x = y = z, which we already saw leads to volume 27 ≠ 23. Contradiction.

Case 1b: λ = -1

Then, z = 2*(-1)x = -2x. But z must be positive, so this is impossible. Therefore, Case 1 (x = y) leads to contradictions.

Case 2: λ = -1

Wait, but in Case 1, when we subtracted equations, we got that either x = y or λ = -1. But in Case 1, when we assumed x = y, we found λ = -1 leads to z = -2x, which is invalid. So, the other possibility is that λ = -1. Let's check that.

Case 2: λ = -1

If λ = -1, then from equation (1): x = -1*(y + z) => x = -y - z

But x, y, z are lengths, so they must be positive. Therefore, x = -y - z is impossible since right-hand side is negative. So, λ = -1 is invalid. Therefore, the only possibility is that x, y, z are not equal, and μ = 0 is not possible? Wait, no, we already considered μ = 0. Wait, perhaps this approach is not working. Let me think.

Alternatively, since we have μ = 0, and the equations are x = λ(y + z), y = λ(x + z), z = λ(x + y). Let's consider dividing equations. Let's divide equation (1) by equation (2):

x/y = (λ(y + z))/(λ(x + z)) => x/y = (y + z)/(x + z)

Cross-multiplying: x(x + z) = y(y + z)

Similarly, x² + xz = y² + yz => x² - y² + xz - yz = 0 => (x - y)(x + y) + z(x - y) = 0 => (x - y)(x + y + z) = 0

Therefore, either x = y or x + y + z = 0. But x, y, z are positive, so x + y + z ≠ 0. Therefore, x = y.

But we already saw that leads to a contradiction unless x = y = z, which is invalid. Therefore, the only solution is x = y = z, which is impossible. Therefore, this suggests that there is no solution with μ = 0, which contradicts our previous conclusion. Therefore, perhaps μ ≠ 0 and the only possibility is that x = y = z, but that's impossible. Therefore, maybe the assumption that μ = 0 is invalid? Wait, no, we derived that if μ ≠ 0, then x = y = z, which is impossible. Therefore, the only possibility is μ = 0, but that leads to a contradiction. Therefore, the conclusion is that there is no solution with μ ≠ 0, which suggests that the extremum occurs on the boundary of the domain? Wait, but the variables x, y, z are positive real numbers, so there's no boundary in the positive orthant. Therefore, perhaps the maximum is achieved when two variables are equal, as in the earlier case.

Alternatively, maybe the maximum occurs when one variable approaches zero, but then the volume would approach zero, which contradicts the volume being 23. So, variables cannot be zero. Therefore, maybe the maximum is indeed achieved when two variables are equal, as in the case x = y = 2, z = 23/4. Then, the space diagonal squared is 657/16, leading to r² = 657/64. But let's check if that's indeed the maximum.

Alternatively, maybe the maximum occurs when all three variables are different. Let's test another case. Let's assume that x, y, z are all different. Let's see if we can find such a case. Let me try to find another solution with different variables.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a unique solution given the constraints, and the maximum is achieved when two variables are equal. Let's see. Let's suppose that x = y. Then, as before, we have x² + 2xz = 27 and x² z = 23. Solving gives x=2, z=23/4. Alternatively, maybe there's another solution with x ≠ y. Let's see.

Suppose x ≠ y. Then, from the Lagrangian conditions, we have:

x = λ(y + z)

y = λ(x + z)

z = λ(x + y)

Let me try to express λ from the first two equations:

From x = λ(y + z), λ = x / (y + z)

From y = λ(x + z), λ = y / (x + z)

Therefore, x / (y + z) = y / (x + z)

Cross-multiplying: x(x + z) = y(y + z)

Which is the same equation as before: x² + xz = y² + yz => x² - y² + xz - yz = 0 => (x - y)(x + y + z) = 0

Again, since x ≠ y, this implies x + y + z = 0, which is impossible. Therefore, the only possibility is x = y. Therefore, the maximum occurs when two variables are equal. Therefore, the case x = y is the only possible case where the maximum is achieved. Therefore, the solution is x = y = 2, z = 23/4, leading to x² + y² + z² = 657/16, so r² = 657/64. Therefore, p = 657, q = 64, which are coprime. Therefore, p + q = 657 + 64 = 721.
