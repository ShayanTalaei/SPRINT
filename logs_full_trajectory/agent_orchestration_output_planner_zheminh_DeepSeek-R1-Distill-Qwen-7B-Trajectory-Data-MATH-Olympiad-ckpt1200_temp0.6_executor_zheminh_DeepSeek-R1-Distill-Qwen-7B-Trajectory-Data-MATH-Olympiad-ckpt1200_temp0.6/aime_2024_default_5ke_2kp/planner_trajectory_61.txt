Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.

Okay, so I need to find the length of AP in triangle ABC where AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. The tangents at B and C intersect at D, and AD intersects the circumcircle ω again at P. Then, express AP as a reduced fraction m/n and find m + n. Hmm, let me try to visualize this first.

<prompt_1.1> Read the problem statement carefully and visualize the triangle and the given points. Then, plan to find the circumradius and check if the triangle is right-angled to simplify calculations. </prompt_1.1>

First, let me sketch the triangle ABC with the given side lengths. AB is 5, BC is 9, and AC is 10. Wait, let me check if this is a valid triangle. The sum of AB and BC is 5 + 9 = 14, which is greater than AC = 10, so triangle inequality holds. Similarly, the other combinations also hold. So, the triangle is valid.

Now, the problem mentions the tangents at B and C to the circumcircle ω intersect at point D. Then, AD intersects ω again at P. We need to find AP. The tangents from a point to a circle are equal in length, so BD = CD? Wait, no. Wait, the tangent from D to ω at B and at C. So, the lengths from D to B and D to C are equal? Wait, no. Wait, the tangent segments from a single external point to a circle are equal. So, if D is outside the circle ω, then the lengths of the two tangents from D to ω are equal. But here, the tangents are at B and C, so maybe D is the point where the tangents at B and C meet. So, D is the ex-pole or something? Hmm, maybe it's the ex-symmedian point or something else. Wait, perhaps I need to recall some properties here.

Alternatively, maybe I can use coordinates or barycentric coordinates to solve this. But before jumping into coordinates, let me see if there's a synthetic approach. Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, then BD and CD are tangents, so BD = CD? Wait, no. Wait, the lengths from D to B and D to C are equal because they're both tangent segments from D to the circle. But wait, the tangent from D to the circle at B is length DB, and tangent from D to the circle at C is DC. Since D is the intersection of the two tangents, then these two lengths are equal. Therefore, DB = DC. So, D lies on the perpendicular bisector of BC? Wait, but BC is a chord of the circle ω. The perpendicular bisector of BC would pass through the center of ω, but D is outside the circle. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, if DB = DC, then D is equidistant from B and C, so it lies on the perpendicular bisector of BC. But since D is the intersection of the two tangents at B and C, that makes sense. So, D is on the perpendicular bisector of BC and outside the circle.

Alternatively, maybe I can use power of a point. The power of point D with respect to ω is equal to DB^2 = DC^2. Also, since D lies on the tangents at B and C, the power of D is DB^2 = DC^2. Also, the power of D with respect to ω is equal to OD^2 - R^2, where O is the center of ω and R is its radius. But I don't know the coordinates of O yet. Maybe I need to compute the circumradius of triangle ABC first.

Let me recall the formula for the circumradius R of a triangle with sides a, b, c: R = (a*b*c)/(4*Δ), where Δ is the area. So, first, I need to compute the area of triangle ABC using Heron's formula.

<prompt_2.1> Calculate the semi-perimeter of triangle ABC, then use Heron's formula to find the area Δ, and compute the circumradius R using the formula R = (a*b*c)/(4Δ). </prompt_2.1>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
The sides are AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. Let me denote a=BC=9, b=AC=10, c=AB=5. Then, the semi-perimeter s = (a + b + c)/2 = (9 + 10 + 5)/2 = 24/2 = 12. Then, the area Δ = √[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)] = √[12*(12 - 9)*(12 - 10)*(12 - 5)] = √[12*3*2*7] = √[12*42] = √[504]. Simplify √504: 504 = 16*31.5? Wait, 504 ÷ 16 = 31.5, which is not an integer. Wait, 504 = 16*31.5? Wait, no. Let's factor 504: 504 = 8*63 = 8*9*7 = 8*9*7. So, √504 = √(8*9*7) = √8 * √9 * √7 = 2√2 * 3 * √7 = 6√14. Wait, 8*9*7 is 504, so √504 = √(8*9*7) = √(36*14) = 6√14. Yes, that's correct. So, Δ = 6√14. Therefore, the circumradius R = (a*b*c)/(4Δ) = (9*10*5)/(4*6√14) = (450)/(24√14) = (75)/(4√14). Rationalizing the denominator: (75√14)/(4*14) = (75√14)/56. So, R = 75√14/56.

Hmm, maybe I can use coordinates. Let me place the triangle in coordinate plane in a convenient way. Let me set point B at (0,0), point C at (9,0), since BC=9. Then, point A is somewhere in the plane such that AB=5 and AC=10. Let me find coordinates of A.

Now, tangents at B and C meet at D. The equation of the tangent at B to the circumcircle can be found using the formula for tangent to a circle.

<prompt_3.2> Write the equation of the tangent at B using the coordinates of B and the circumcircle equation, then find the equation of the tangent at C. Find the intersection point D of these tangents. </prompt_3.2>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
Let me denote coordinates as follows: Let’s place point B at (0,0), point C at (9,0). Then, point A is somewhere in the plane. We know AB = 5 and AC = 10. Let me set coordinates for A as (x,y). Then, distance from A to B is √(x² + y²) = 5, so x² + y² = 25. Distance from A to C is √[(x - 9)² + y²] = 10, so (x - 9)² + y² = 100. Subtract the first equation from the second: (x - 9)² + y² - (x² + y²) = 100 - 25 => x² - 18x + 81 + y² - x² - y² = 75 => -18x + 81 = 75 => -18x = -6 => x = 6/18 = 1/3. So, x = 1/3. Then, substitute back into x² + y² = 25: (1/3)² + y² = 25 => 1/9 + y² = 25 => y² = 25 - 1/9 = 224/9 => y = ±√(224)/3 = ±(8√14)/3. Since triangles are typically considered in upper half-plane, let's take y = 8√14/3. So, coordinates of A are (1/3, 8√14/3).

The circumcircle has center at (2.5, 3√14/4) and radius R = 75√14/56. Wait, but maybe this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can use the property that the tangents from D to the circle ω at B and C. So, the line DB is tangent to ω at B, so the line DB is perpendicular to the radius OB. Similarly, DC is tangent at C, so DC is perpendicular to OC. Therefore, if I can find the coordinates of O, then I can find the equations of the tangents at B and C, find their intersection D, and then find AD, which intersects ω again at P. Then, compute AP.

Now, the circumcircle ω passes through A, B, C. Its center is the circumcenter of triangle ABC. Let me compute the circumcenter.

<prompt_4.1> Using the coordinates of A, B, and C, find the circumcenter O of triangle ABC by solving the perpendicular bisector equations. </prompt_4.1>
-----

Based on execution_3.2:
First, coordinates of O: since A is (1/3, 8√14/3), B is (0,0), C is (9,0). The circumcenter O is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of AB and AC.

Let me compute the midpoint of AB: midpoint M1 = ((1/3 + 0)/2, (8√14/3 + 0)/2) = (1/6, 4√14/3). The slope of AB is (8√14/3 - 0)/(1/3 - 0) = (8√14/3)/(1/3) = 8√14. Therefore, the perpendicular bisector of AB has slope -1/(8√14). So, equation of perpendicular bisector of AB: y - 4√14/3 = (-1/(8√14))(x - 1/6).

Similarly, compute midpoint of AC: midpoint M2 = ((1/3 + 9)/2, (8√14/3 + 0)/2) = ((28/3)/2, 4√14/3) = (14/3, 4√14/3). The slope of AC is (0 - 8√14/3)/(9 - 1/3) = (-8√14/3)/(26/3) = -8√14/26 = -4√14/13. Therefore, the perpendicular bisector of AC has slope 13/(4√14). Equation: y - 4√14/3 = (13/(4√14))(x - 14/3).
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
The perpendicular bisector of AB: midpoint of AB is ( (1/3 + 0)/2, (8√14/3 + 0)/2 ) = (1/6, 4√14/3). The slope of AB is (8√14/3 - 0)/(1/3 - 0) = (8√14/3)/(1/3) = 8√14. Therefore, the perpendicular bisector of AB has slope -1/(8√14). So, the equation is y - 4√14/3 = (-1/(8√14))(x - 1/6).

Similarly, the perpendicular bisector of AC: midpoint of AC is ( (1/3 + 9)/2, (8√14/3 + 0)/2 ) = ( (28/3)/2, 4√14/3 ) = (14/3, 4√14/3). The slope of AC is (0 - 8√14/3)/(9 - 1/3) = (-8√14/3)/(26/3) = -8√14/26 = -4√14/13. Therefore, the perpendicular bisector of AC has slope 13/(4√14). So, equation: y - 4√14/3 = (13/(4√14))(x - 14/3).

Let me compute the coordinates of O. From above, O is (14/3, 4√14/3). Wait, no, wait. Wait, I just found O as ( (1/6 + 14/3)/2, ... )? Wait, no. Wait, we found O by solving the perpendicular bisectors. Let me re-examine.

<prompt_5.2> Re-express the equations of the perpendicular bisectors of AB and AC in standard form and solve them to find the circumcenter O. </prompt_5.2>

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
First equation: y = (-1/(8√14))(x - 1/6) + 4√14/3.

Second equation: y = (13/(4√14))(x - 14/3) + 4√14/3.

Set them equal:

(-1/(8√14))(x - 1/6) + 4√14/3 = (13/(4√14))(x - 14/3) + 4√14/3.

Subtract 4√14/3 from both sides:

(-1/(8√14))(x - 1/6) = (13/(4√14))(x - 14/3).

Multiply both sides by 8√14 to eliminate denominators:

-1*(x - 1/6) = 13*2*(x - 14/3).

Simplify left side: -x + 1/6.

Right side: 26x - (26*14)/3 = 26x - 364/3.

So, equation: -x + 1/6 = 26x - 364/3.

Bring all terms to left side:

- x + 1/6 - 26x + 364/3 = 0 => -27x + (1/6 + 364/3) = 0.

Compute 1/6 + 364/3 = 1/6 + 728/6 = 729/6 = 243/2.

So, -27x + 243/2 = 0 => -27x = -243/2 => x = (243/2)/27 = (243)/(54) = 4.5 = 9/2.

So, x = 9/2. Then, substitute back into one of the equations, say the first one:

y = (-1/(8√14))(9/2 - 1/6) + 4√14/3.

Compute 9/2 - 1/6 = 27/6 - 1/6 = 26/6 = 13/3.

So, y = (-1/(8√14))*(13/3) + 4√14/3 = (-13)/(24√14) + 4√14/3.

To combine these terms, let's rationalize the denominators:

First term: (-13)/(24√14) = (-13√14)/(24*14) = (-13√14)/336.

Second term: 4√14/3 = (4√14 * 112)/336 = (448√14)/336.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to get a common denominator. Let's write both terms with denominator 336:

First term: (-13√14)/336.

Second term: (4√14)/3 = (4√14 * 112)/336 = (448√14)/336.

Wait, 4√14 /3 = (4√14 * 112)/336? Wait, 336 divided by 3 is 112. So, 4√14/3 = (4√14 * 112)/336. Wait, no. Wait, 4√14/3 = (4√14 * 112)/336? Wait, that would be 4√14 * 112 / 336 = 4√14 * (112/336) = 4√14 * (1/3) = 4√14/3. Hmm, maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, let's multiply numerator and denominator by √14 to rationalize:

First term: (-13)/(24√14) = (-13√14)/(24*14) = (-13√14)/336.

Second term: 4√14/3 = (4√14 * 112)/336. Wait, 4√14/3 = (4√14 * 112)/336? Wait, 336 divided by 3 is 112. So, 4√14/3 = 4√14 * (112)/336. Wait, that seems complex. Maybe just add them as they are.

So, y = (-13√14)/336 + 4√14/3 = (-13√14 + 448√14)/336 = (435√14)/336. Simplify 435/336: divide numerator and denominator by 3: 145/112. So, y = (145√14)/112.

Therefore, the circumcenter O is at (9/2, 145√14/112).

Wait, the perpendicular bisector of AB had midpoint (1/6, 4√14/3) and slope -1/(8√14). The equation is y - 4√14/3 = (-1/(8√14))(x - 1/6). Similarly, the perpendicular bisector of AC had midpoint (14/3, 4√14/3) and slope 13/(4√14). The equation is y - 4√14/3 = (13/(4√14))(x - 14/3).

Let me solve these two equations. Let me denote the first equation as Eq1 and the second as Eq2.

From Eq1: y = (-1/(8√14))(x - 1/6) + 4√14/3.

From Eq2: y = (13/(4√14))(x - 14/3) + 4√14/3.

Set them equal:

(-1/(8√14))(x - 1/6) + 4√14/3 = (13/(4√14))(x - 14/3) + 4√14/3.

Subtract 4√14/3 from both sides:

(-1/(8√14))(x - 1/6) = (13/(4√14))(x - 14/3).

Multiply both sides by 8√14 to eliminate denominators:

-1*(x - 1/6) = 26*(x - 14/3).

Simplify:

- x + 1/6 = 26x - (26*14)/3.

Bring all terms to left side:

- x + 1/6 - 26x + (26*14)/3 = 0.

Combine like terms:

-27x + (1/6 + 26*14/3) = 0.

Compute constants:

1/6 + (26*14)/3 = 1/6 + 364/3 = 1/6 + 728/6 = 729/6 = 243/2.

So:

-27x + 243/2 = 0 => -27x = -243/2 => x = (243/2)/27 = (243)/(54) = 4.5 = 9/2.

Therefore, x = 9/2. Then, substitute back into Eq1 to find y:

y = (-1/(8√14))(9/2 - 1/6) + 4√14/3.

Compute 9/2 - 1/6 = (27/6 - 1/6) = 26/6 = 13/3.

Therefore, y = (-1/(8√14))(13/3) + 4√14/3 = (-13)/(24√14) + 4√14/3.

Convert to common denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator of the first term by √14 to rationalize:

(-13√14)/(24*14) + (4√14/3) = (-13√14)/336 + (4√14/3) = (-13√14 + 448√14)/336 = (435√14)/336.

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Divide numerator and denominator by 3: 435/3 = 145, 336/3 = 112. So, 145√14/112.

Therefore, the circumcenter O is at (9/2, 145√14/112).

Now, the tangents at B and C to the circumcircle ω. The tangent at a point on a circle is perpendicular to the radius at that point. Therefore, the tangent at B is perpendicular to OB, and the tangent at C is perpendicular to OC.

Based on execution_5.2:
Now, equation of tangent at B: since it's perpendicular to OB. The slope of OB is (0 - 145√14/112)/(0 - 9/2) = (-145√14/112)/(-9/2) = (145√14/112)/(9/2) = (145√14/112)*(2/9) = (290√14)/(1008) = 145√14/504. Therefore, the slope of OB is 145√14/504. Therefore, the slope of tangent at B is the negative reciprocal: -504/(145√14). Similarly, the tangent at C is perpendicular to OC.

<prompt_6.2> Find the slopes of the tangents at B and C using the coordinates of O and the slopes of OB and OC, then write the equations of the tangents. </prompt_6.2>
</Plan_6>

<Execution_6>
<execution_6.1>
So, the slope of OB is (145√14/112 - 0)/(9/2 - 0) = (145√14/112)/(9/2) = (145√14/112)*(2/9) = (290√14)/(1008) = 145√14/504. Therefore, the slope of tangent at B is the negative reciprocal: -504/(145√14). Similarly, the slope of OC is (145√14/112 - 0)/(9/2 - 9) = (145√14/112)/(-9/2) = -145√14/(112*9/2) = -145√14/(504). Therefore, the slope of tangent at C is the negative reciprocal: 504/(145√14).
</execution_6.1>

<execution_6.2>
The slope of OC is (0 - 145√14/112)/(9 - 0) = (-145√14/112)/9 = -145√14/(1008). Therefore, the slope of tangent at C is the negative reciprocal: 1008/(145√14).

Now, write the equations of the tangents. The tangent at B passes through B(0,0) and has slope -504/(145√14). So, its equation is y = (-504/(145√14))x. Similarly, the tangent at C passes through C(9,0) and has slope 1008/(145√14). So, its equation is y = (1008/(145√14))(x - 9).

Now, find the intersection point D of these two tangents. Set the two equations equal:

(-504/(145√14))x = (1008/(145√14))(x - 9).

Multiply both sides by 145√14 to eliminate denominators:

-504x = 1008(x - 9).

Divide both sides by 504:

- x = 2(x - 9) => -x = 2x - 18 => -3x = -18 => x = 6.

Substitute x = 6 into one of the tangent equations, say y = (-504/(145√14))x:

y = (-504/(145√14))*6 = (-3024)/(145√14).

Simplify this expression. Let's rationalize the denominator:

y = (-3024)/(145√14) * (√14/√14) = (-3024√14)/(145*14) = (-3024√14)/2030.

Simplify the fraction. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 2: (-1512√14)/1015. Check if 1512 and 1015 have a common factor. 1015 factors into 5*7*29. 1512 divided by 5 is 302.4, not integer. 1512 ÷7 = 216, which is integer. 1015 ÷7 = 145. So, divide numerator and denominator by 7: (-1512/7)= -216, (-1015/7)= -145. So, y = (-216√14)/(-145) = (216√14)/145. Therefore, point D is at (6, 216√14/145).

<prompt_7.1> Parametrize the line AD and find its parametric equations in terms of a parameter t. </prompt_7.1>

Based on execution_6.1, execution_6.2:
So, AP is the distance from A to P. The coordinates of A are (1/3, 8√14/3), and coordinates of P are (1/3, -8√14/3). So, the distance between these two points is sqrt[(1/3 - 1/3)^2 + (-8√14/3 - 8√14/3)^2] = sqrt[0 + (-16√14/3)^2] = sqrt[(256*14)/9] = sqrt[3584/9] = (sqrt(3584))/3. But 3584 = 64*56, so sqrt(3584) = 8*sqrt(56) = 8*sqrt(4*14) = 16*sqrt(14). Therefore, AP = 16*sqrt(14)/3.

Wait, but let me verify this. Wait, coordinates of A are (1/3, 8√14/3) and P is (1/3, -8√14/3). So, the vertical distance between them is (8√14/3 - (-8√14/3)) = 16√14/3. Since they share the same x-coordinate, the distance AP is just the difference in y-coordinates, which is 16√14/3. So, written as m/n, where m and n are coprime, 16 and 3 are coprime, so m=16, n=3. Therefore, m + n = 19.

Based on execution_6.2:
Therefore, AP = 16√14/3. But the problem states that AP can be written as m/n. Wait, but 16√14/3 is not a rational number. Wait, did I make a mistake here?

Wait, hold on. Wait, the coordinates of P are (1/3, -8√14/3), and A is (1/3, 8√14/3). So, the distance between them is sqrt[(1/3 - 1/3)^2 + (-8√14/3 - 8√14/3)^2] = sqrt[0 + (-16√14/3)^2] = 16√14/3. So, AP is 16√14/3. But the problem states that AP can be written as m/n, where m and n are relatively prime integers. But 16√14/3 is not a rational number. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the calculations. Wait, let me check the steps again.

Let me compute the differences in coordinates:

Δx = 6 - 1/3 = 17/3, Δy = 216√14/145 - 8√14/3. Let me compute Δy:

Convert to a common denominator. The denominators are 145 and 3, so common denominator is 435.

216√14/145 = (216√14 * 3)/435 = 648√14/435

8√14/3 = (8√14 * 145)/435 = 1160√14/435

So, Δy = 648√14/435 - 1160√14/435 = (-512√14)/435

Therefore, parametric equations:

x = 1/3 + (17/3)t

y = 8√14/3 + (-512√14/435)t

Simplify the y-component:

Let me write -512/435 as -512/435. Let's see if this can be simplified. 512 and 435: 512 ÷ 5 = 102.4, not integer. 435 ÷ 5 = 87. So, no common factors. So, y = 8√14/3 - (512√14/435)t

Now, we need to find the intersection of this line with the circumcircle ω. The circumcircle passes through A, B, C, and has center O(9/2, 145√14/112) and radius R = 75√14/56. The equation of the circumcircle is (x - 9/2)^2 + (y - 145√14/112)^2 = (75√14/56)^2.

Substitute the parametric equations into the circle equation. This will result in a quadratic equation in t. Solving for t will give the parameter values corresponding to points A and P. Since we already know point A is on the line and the circle, one solution will be t=0. The other solution will correspond to point P.

This seems like a lot of algebra, but let's proceed step by step.

Based on execution_7.1:
First, compute (x - 9/2):

x = 1/3 + (17/3)t ⇒ x - 9/2 = 1/3 - 9/2 + (17/3)t = (2/6 - 27/6) + (17/3)t = (-25/6) + (17/3)t = (-25/6) + (34/6)t = (-25 + 34t)/6.

Similarly, compute (y - 145√14/112):

y = 8√14/3 - (512√14/435)t ⇒ y - 145√14/112 = 8√14/3 - 145√14/112 - (512√14/435)t.

Let me compute the constant terms:

8√14/3 - 145√14/112. Let's convert to common denominator 336:

8√14/3 = 896√14/336

145√14/112 = 435√14/336

So, 896√14/336 - 435√14/336 = 461√14/336

Therefore, y - 145√14/112 = 461√14/336 - (512√14/435)t.

Now, the equation becomes:

[(-25 + 34t)/6]^2 + [461√14/336 - (512√14/435)t]^2 = (75√14/56)^2

This equation is quite complex. Let me compute each term step by step.

<prompt_8.1> Write out the circle equation substituting the parametric coordinates of line AD and expand each term step by step to simplify the equation. </prompt_8.1>
</Plan_8>

<Execution_8>
<execution_8.1>
First term: [(-25 + 34t)/6]^2 = (625 - 1700t + 1156t²)/36

Second term: [461√14/336 - (512√14/435)t]^2. Let's factor out √14:

√14*(461/336 - 512/435 t). Then square it:

14*(461/336 - 512/435 t)^2.

Compute (461/336 - 512/435 t)^2:

= (461/336)^2 - 2*(461/336)*(512/435)t + (512/435)^2 t²

Multiply by 14:

14*(461²/336² - 2*461*512/(336*435)t + (512²/435²)t²)

Similarly, the right side is (75√14/56)^2 = 75²*14/56² = 5625*14/3136 = 78750/3136 = 39375/1568.

Now, combining all terms:

Left side:

(625 - 1700t + 1156t²)/36 + 14*(461²/336² - 2*461*512/(336*435)t + (512²/435²)t²) = 39375/1568

This is a quadratic equation in t. Solving this will give t = 0 (point A) and t = t_p (point P). However, solving this algebraically is very tedious. Maybe there's a better approach using power of a point or projective geometry.

<Plan_9>
Based on execution_8.1:
Alternatively, maybe use inversion or other projective geometry techniques, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, since AD intersects the circumcircle at P, and we need AP, maybe use the power of point A with respect to the circle. Wait, but A is on the circle, so its power is zero. That might not help. Alternatively, use coordinates to find P.

Alternatively, maybe parameterize AD and find its intersection with the circle. But the algebra is too involved. Maybe use the parametric equations and solve numerically.

Alternatively, note that points A and D are both on the circumcircle. Wait, but point D is outside the circle. Wait, no. Since D is the intersection of tangents at B and C, and the tangents are outside the circle, so D is outside the circle. Therefore, line AD passes through A (on the circle) and D (outside), and intersects the circle again at P. Therefore, AP is the length from A to P along line AD.

Now, solving this quadratic equation for t:

Let me denote the equation as:

A*t² + B*t + C = 0,

where A, B, C are the coefficients from the left side minus the right side.

</Plan_9>

<Execution_9>
<execution_9.1>
Let me compute each coefficient step by step.

First term: (625 - 1700t + 1156t²)/36

Second term: 14*(461²/336² - 2*461*512/(336*435)t + (512²/435²)t²)

Let me compute each part:

Compute 461²: 461*461. Let's compute 400² + 2*400*61 + 61² = 160000 + 48800 + 3721 = 160000 + 48800 = 208800 + 3721 = 212,521. So, 461² = 212,521.

Similarly, 512² = 262,144.

Compute denominators:

First term denominator: 336² = 112,896

Second term coefficients:

First term: 461²/336² = 212,521/112,896

Second term coefficient: -2*461*512/(336*435). Let's compute numerator: 2*461*512 = 922*512 = Let's compute 900*512 = 460,800 and 22*512=11,264, so total 460,800 + 11,264 = 472,064. Denominator: 336*435 = 144,720. So, coefficient is -472,064/144,720. Simplify: divide numerator and denominator by 48: 472,064 ÷48=9,834.666... Hmm, maybe not helpful. Let me see if 472,064 and 144,720 have a common factor. Let's check GCD(472064, 144720).

Compute GCD(144720, 472064 - 3*144720) = GCD(144720, 472064 - 434160) = GCD(144720, 37904). Then GCD(144720, 37904). 144720 ÷ 37904 = 3, remainder 144720 - 3*37904 = 144720 - 113712 = 31,008. Then GCD(37904, 31,008). 37904 - 31,008 = 6,896. GCD(31,008, 6,896). 31,008 ÷6,896=4, remainder 31,008 - 27,584=3,424. GCD(6,896,3,424). 6,896 ÷3,424=2, remainder 0. So GCD is 3,424. Therefore, 472,064 ÷3,424=138, and 144,720 ÷3,424=42.375, which is not integer. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check 472,064 ÷3,424: 3,424*138=3,424*100 +3,424*38=342,400 +130,092=472,492. Hmm, that's more than 472,064. So, maybe it's 3,424*137=3,424*(138 -1)=472,492 -3,424=469,068. Still not matching. Maybe the fraction is -472064/144720. Let's simplify numerator and denominator by 8: 472064 ÷8=59,008; 144720 ÷8=18,090. So, -59,008/18,090. Further divide by 2: -29,504/9,045. Not helpful. Maybe leave as is.

Third term: (512²/435²)t² = 262,144/189,225 t²

Now, putting all together:

Left side:

(625/36 - 1700/36 t + 1156/36 t²) + 14*(212,521/112,896 - 472,064/144,720 t + 262,144/189,225 t²) = 39375/1568

Multiply out:

First term:

625/36 - 1700/36 t + 1156/36 t²

Second term:

14*212,521/112,896 - 14*472,064/144,720 t + 14*262,144/189,225 t²

Simplify each term:

First term remains as is.

Second term:

14*212,521 = 2,975,294; 2,975,294/112,896 ≈ 26.36, but keep as fraction.

14*472,064 = 6,608,896; 6,608,896/144,720 ≈ 45.73, but again keep as fraction.

14*262,144 = 3,670,016; 3,670,016/189,225 ≈ 19.39, but keep as fraction.

Now, putting all together:

Left side:

625/36 - 1700/36 t + 1156/36 t² + 2,975,294/112,896 - 6,608,896/144,720 t + 3,670,016/189,225 t²

Now, convert all fractions to have a common denominator to combine terms. However, this seems extremely tedious. Maybe instead, we can factor out common factors.

Alternatively, note that this is a quadratic equation in t. Let me denote coefficients as:

A = 1156/36 + 3,670,016/189,225

B = -1700/36 - 6,608,896/144,720

C = 625/36 + 2,975,294/112,896

But even this is messy. Alternatively, perhaps use numerical approximations to estimate the value of t.

Given that point A is at t=0, and point D is at t=1, the intersection point P will be at some t>1 or t<0. Since AD is extended beyond D, the parameter t for P should be greater than 1. Let me assume that t_p > 1. Let's try to compute the value numerically.

Alternatively, since this is getting too involved, perhaps use a different approach. Let's recall that in a circle, the power of a point D with respect to ω is equal to DA * DP = DB^2 = DC^2. Wait, power of point D with respect to ω is DB^2 = DC^2 = DA * DP. Therefore, DA * DP = DB^2. So, if we can compute DB and DA, then DP = DB^2 / DA, and AP = AD - DP. Wait, but AD is not directly known. Wait, but AD is the length from A to D. Alternatively, since power of point D: DB^2 = DA * DP. So, DP = DB^2 / DA. Then, AP = AD - DP. But we need to compute DA and DB.

But in this problem, the triangle ABC has AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. Point D is the intersection of tangents at B and C to ω. Therefore, DB = DC, and power of D with respect to ω is DB^2 = DC^2. Also, power of D can be expressed as DA * DP. Therefore, DA * DP = DB^2. So, if we can compute DB and DA, we can find DP = DB^2 / DA, and then AP = AD - DP. But how do we compute DB and DA?

Alternatively, use coordinates to find DA and DB.

First, compute DB. Point D is at (6, 145√14/112). Point B is at (0,0). So, DB is the distance between (6, 145√14/112) and (0,0):

DB = sqrt(6² + (145√14/112)^2) = sqrt(36 + (145² *14)/112²)

Compute 145² = 21,025. So, 21,025*14 = 294,350. Then, 294,350 / (112²). 112²=12,544. So, 294,350 /12,544 ≈ 23.47. So, DB ≈ sqrt(36 + 23.47) ≈ sqrt(59.47) ≈ 7.71.

Similarly, compute DA. Point A is at (1/3, 8√14/3). Point D is at (6, 145√14/112). So, DA is the distance between these two points:

DA = sqrt[(6 - 1/3)^2 + (145√14/112 - 8√14/3)^2]

Compute 6 - 1/3 = 17/3. 145√14/112 - 8√14/3 = (145√14*3 - 8√14*112)/(112*3) = (435√14 - 896√14)/336 = (-461√14)/336.

Therefore, DA = sqrt[(17/3)^2 + (-461√14/336)^2] = sqrt(289/9 + (461²*14)/336²)

Compute 461² = 212,521. So, 212,521*14 = 2,975,294. 336² = 112,896. Therefore, DA = sqrt(289/9 + 2,975,294/112,896)

Convert 289/9 to denominator 112,896: 289/9 = (289*12,544)/112,896 = 3,620,  3,620,  289*12,544 is 3,620,  289*10,000=2,890,000, 289*2,000=578,000, 289*544=157,  289*500=144,500, 289*44=12,716. So total 144,500 +12,716=157,216. So total 2,890,000 +578,000 +157,216=3,625,216. So, 289/9 = 3,625,216/112,896.

Therefore, DA = sqrt(3,625,216/112,896 + 2,975,294/112,896) = sqrt((3,625,216 + 2,975,294)/112,896) = sqrt(6,600,510/112,896)

Simplify numerator and denominator by dividing numerator and denominator by 6: 6,600,510 ÷6=1,100,085; 112,896 ÷6=18,816. So, sqrt(1,100,085/18,816). Let's see if this fraction can be simplified. Let's check GCD of numerator and denominator. 1,100,085 and 18,816. GCD(18,816,1,100,085). 1,100,085 ÷18,816=58. 18,816*58=1,091,328. Subtract from 1,100,085: 1,100,085 -1,091,328=8,757. Now GCD(18,816,8,757). 18,816 ÷8,757=2.145... Not integer. So, GCD is 1. Therefore, sqrt(1,100,085/18,816). Let me compute this value numerically.

Compute 1,100,085 ÷18,816 ≈ 58.14. So sqrt(58.14) ≈ 7.625. So DA ≈7.625. DB ≈7.71. Then, power of D: DB^2 ≈58.14. Then DP = DB^2 / DA ≈58.14 /7.625≈7.625. Then AP = AD - DP ≈7.625 -7.625=0. That can't be. Wait, that suggests P coincides with A, which is not possible.

Wait, that can't be right. There must be a mistake here. Wait, no, power of a point D with respect to ω is equal to DB^2 = DA * DP. So, if DB^2 = DA * DP, then DP = DB^2 / DA. So, if DB ≈7.71, DB^2 ≈59.43. DA ≈7.625. Then DP ≈59.43 /7.625≈7.77. Then, AP = AD - DP = 7.625 -7.77≈-0.145? That doesn't make sense. AP is a length, so it can't be negative. This suggests an error in reasoning.

Wait, perhaps the direction is different. Since point D is outside the circle, the power of point D with respect to ω is equal to DB^2 = DA * DP, where DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is the distance from D to P. However, in the power of a point theorem, if D is outside the circle, and a line through D intersects the circle at two points, then the power is equal to the product of the lengths from D to each intersection point. So, if the line AD intersects the circle at A and P, then DA * DP = DB^2. However, since A is on the circle, DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is the distance from D to P. But in reality, since A is on the circle, DA is the length from D to A, and AP is the length from A to P, which is along the line. Therefore, the power of point D is DA * DP, where DP is the length from D to P. But AP = |DP - DA| depending on the direction. Wait, perhaps I need to be careful with signs.

Wait, in the power of a point formula, if the line through D intersects the circle at two points X and Y, then DX * DY = power of D. In our case, the line AD intersects the circle at A and P. So, DA * DP = DB^2. However, since A is one intersection point and P is the other, depending on the direction, DP could be measured as PA if P is on the extension beyond A. Wait, in our case, since D is outside the circle, and the line AD passes through A (on the circle) and extends to P (another intersection), then the power of D is DA * DP, where DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is the distance from D to P. Therefore, DA * DP = DB^2. But if P is on the extension of AD beyond A, then AP = DP - DA. Wait, no. Wait, if A is between D and P, then DP = DA + AP. So, DA * (DA + AP) = DB^2. Therefore, DA^2 + DA * AP = DB^2 ⇒ DA * AP = DB^2 - DA^2 ⇒ AP = (DB^2 - DA^2)/DA.

Wait, that makes sense. So, AP = (DB² - DA²)/DA.

Therefore, in our case, AP = (DB² - DA²)/DA. Since DB² = 7.71² ≈59.43, DA ≈7.625, so DA² ≈58.14. Then, 59.43 -58.14 ≈1.29, divided by 7.625 gives AP ≈0.169. Which is 16/93 ≈0.172. Wait, but earlier calculation gave us 16√14/3≈16*3.7417/3≈19.54, which is way larger. So, this suggests an error in the coordinate approach. So, maybe the coordinate approach was wrong.

Wait, but according to the power of point theorem, AP = (DB² - DA²)/DA. Let's compute this symbolically.

Given that DB² = DC² = (145√14/112)^2 + (145√14/112)^2? Wait, no. Wait, DB is the distance from D to B. Point D is at (6, 145√14/112). Point B is at (0,0). So, DB = sqrt(6² + (145√14/112)^2). Similarly, DA is the distance from D to A, which is sqrt[(6 - 1/3)^2 + (145√14/112 - 8√14/3)^2]. 

But instead of computing numerically, let's compute DB² and DA² symbolically.

Compute DB² = 6² + (145√14/112)^2 = 36 + (145² *14)/112²

Compute DA² = (17/3)^2 + (-461√14/336)^2 = (289/9) + (461² *14)/336²

Compute DB² - DA² = [36 + (145² *14)/112²] - [289/9 + (461² *14)/336²]

But this seems complicated. Let's compute each term:

First term: 36 = 36/1

Second term: (145² *14)/112². 145²=21025, so 21025*14=294,350. 112²=12,544. So, 294,350/12,544 ≈23.47

Third term: 289/9 ≈32.111

Fourth term: (461² *14)/336². 461²=212,521. 212,521*14=2,975,294. 336²=112,896. 2,975,294/112,896 ≈26.36

Therefore, DB² - DA² ≈36 +23.47 -32.111 -26.36 ≈36 +23.47=59.47 -32.111=27.36 -26.36=1.

Therefore, DB² - DA² ≈1. Therefore, AP = 1/DA. But DA was approximately 7.625, so AP ≈1/7.625≈0.131. But according to the coordinate approach, AP was 16√14/3≈19.54, which is a contradiction. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the coordinate approach. 

Wait, but according to the power of point theorem, AP = (DB² - DA²)/DA. If DB² - DA² =1, then AP=1/DA. But according to the coordinate approach, we found AP≈19.54, which is inconsistent. Therefore, likely the coordinate approach has an error.

But how? Let's see. If we found that the coordinates of P are (1/3, -8√14/3), then AP is the distance between A(1/3,8√14/3) and P(1/3, -8√14/3). The difference in y-coordinates is 16√14/3, and x-coordinates are the same, so the distance is 16√14/3. But according to the power of a point theorem, AP should be (DB² - DA²)/DA. Therefore, there must be an error in the coordinate approach. 

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of the parametric equations. Let me verify the coordinates of D again. Earlier, we found D at (6, 145√14/112). Let's confirm that the tangent at B has slope -504/(145√14) and passes through B(0,0). The equation is y = (-504/(145√14))x. Similarly, the tangent at C has slope 13/(4√14) and passes through C(9,0). The equation is y = (13/(4√14))(x -9). 

Solving for intersection D:

Set (-504/(145√14))x = (13/(4√14))(x -9)

Multiply both sides by 145√14*4√14 to eliminate denominators:

-504*4*14 x = 13*145*(x -9)

Simplify:

-2016*14 x = 13*145 x - 13*145*9

Compute:

-28,224x = 1,885x - 17,955

Bring variables to left:

-28,224x -1,885x = -17,955

-30,109x = -17,955

Thus, x = 17,955 /30,109 ≈0.596. Wait, but earlier we had x=6. Wait, this contradicts. So, my previous calculation of x=6 is wrong. Wait, this is a critical error. 

Wait, let's solve the equation again:

Equation:

(-504/(145√14))x = (13/(4√14))(x -9)

Multiply both sides by 145√14:

-504x = (13*145/4)(x -9)

Compute 13*145/4: 13*145=1,885, so 1,885/4.

Thus:

-504x = (1,885/4)(x -9)

Multiply both sides by 4:

-2016x = 1,885x - 17,065

Bring variables to left:

-2016x -1,885x = -17,065

-3,901x = -17,065

Thus, x = 17,065 /3,901 ≈4.375. 

Wait, 17,065 ÷3,901. Let's check: 3,901*4=15,604. 17,065 -15,604=1,461. 3,901*0.375=1,462.875. Close. So x≈4.375, which is 35/8=4.375. Therefore, x=35/8=4.375. Then, y= (-504/(145√14))*(35/8)= (-504*35)/(145√14*8)= (-17,640)/(1,160√14)= (-17,640 ÷ 40)/(1,160 ÷40 √14)= (-441)/(29√14). Rationalize:

y= (-441√14)/(29*14)= (-441√14)/406= (-63√14)/58≈-1.43√14≈-5.39/3.7417≈-1.43*3.7417≈-5.39. Wait, but in the previous calculation, I thought y=-8√14/3≈-1.333*3.7417≈-4.32. But this is inconsistent. Therefore, there's a miscalculation here. 

Wait, let's recompute:

y= (-504/(145√14))*(35/8)= (-504*35)/(145*8√14)= (-17,640)/(1,160√14). Simplify numerator and denominator by dividing numerator and denominator by 40: numerator is -17,640 ÷40= -441, denominator is 1,160 ÷40=29. So, -441/(29√14). Multiply numerator and denominator by √14:

y= (-441√14)/(29*14)= (-441√14)/406. Simplify 441 and 406: GCD(441,406)=7. 441 ÷7=63, 406 ÷7=58. So, y= (-63√14)/58. So, y= -63√14/58≈-63*3.7417/58≈-237.7/58≈-4.1. 

Wait, but earlier, when solving for y, I had y= (-16√14)/3≈-1.333*3.7417≈-4.99. But according to this, y= -63√14/58≈-4.1. These are different. So, this suggests an error in the coordinate calculation. 

Wait, the error is in the calculation of the parametric equations. Let me check the slope of the tangent at B again. The tangent at B has slope -504/(145√14). So, the equation is y= (-504/(145√14))x. Correct. Then, when solving for intersection with tangent at C, which has slope 13/(4√14). So, equation is y= (13/(4√14))(x -9). Correct. Setting them equal:

(-504/(145√14))x = (13/(4√14))(x -9)

Multiply both sides by 145√14:

-504x = (13*145/4)(x -9)

Compute 13*145=1,885. So, 1,885/4. Therefore:

-504x = (1,885/4)x - (1,885/4)*9

Multiply both sides by 4:

-2016x = 1,885x - 1,885*9

Compute 1,885*9=16,965

Thus:

-2016x -1,885x = -16,965

-3,901x = -16,965

Thus, x=16,965 /3,901. Let's compute 16,965 ÷3,901. 

3,901*4=15,604. 16,965 -15,604=1,361. 3,901*0.35≈1,365. So, x≈4.35. 

Wait, 3,901*4.35=3,901*4 +3,901*0.35=15,604 +1,365.35=16,969.35. Close to 16,965. So x≈4.35 - (16,969.35 -16,965)/3,901≈4.35 -4.35/3,901≈4.35 -0.0011≈4.3489≈4.35. Therefore, x≈4.35. 

But 16,965 ÷3,901=4.3489. So, x=16,965/3,901=4.3489. 

Then y= (-504/(145√14))*(16,965/3,901). Compute this:

First, note that 16,965=3,901*4.3489. Let's see if 16,965=3,901*4.3489. 3,901*4=15,604, 3,901*0.3489≈3,901*0.3=1,170.3, 3,901*0.0489≈189.5. Total≈1,170.3+189.5≈1,359.8. So, total≈15,604 +1,359.8≈16,963.8, which is close to 16,965. So, approximate. 

Therefore, y≈ (-504/(145√14))*(4.3489). Compute 504/145≈3.479, so 3.479/√14≈3.479/3.7417≈0.93. Therefore, y≈-0.93*4.3489≈-4.04. So, approximately (4.35, -4.04). 

But according to the power of a point theorem, AP should be (DB² - DA²)/DA≈1/7.625≈0.13. However, according to the coordinate approach, we found that AP≈16√14/3≈19.54, which is inconsistent. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the coordinate approach. 

But why? Let's see. If AP = (DB² - DA²)/DA, and we found that DB² - DA²≈1, then AP≈1/DA≈1/7.625≈0.13. But the coordinate approach gives AP≈19.54. Therefore, there is a contradiction. 

This suggests that the mistake is in the coordinate approach. Let's check the calculation of DA and DB.

Wait, DA is the distance from D to A. D is at (16, 216√14/112). A is at (1/3, 8√14/3). 

Compute DA:

Δx=16 -1/3=47/3, Δy=216√14/112 -8√14/3= (216√14*3 -8√14*112)/(112*3)= (648√14 - 896√14)/336= (-248√14)/336= (-62√14)/84= (-31√14)/42. 

Thus, DA= sqrt( (47/3)^2 + (-31√14/42)^2 )

Compute (47/3)^2=2,209/9≈245.444

Compute (-31√14/42)^2= (961*14)/1,764=13,454/1,764≈7.627

Thus, DA≈sqrt(245.4
