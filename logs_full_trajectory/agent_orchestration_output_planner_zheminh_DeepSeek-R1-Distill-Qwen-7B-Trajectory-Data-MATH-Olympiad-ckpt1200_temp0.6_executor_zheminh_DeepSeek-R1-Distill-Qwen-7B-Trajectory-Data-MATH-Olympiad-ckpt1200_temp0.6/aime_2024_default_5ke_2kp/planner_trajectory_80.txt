<Question>
Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.

<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to find the smallest integer b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.

<prompt_1.1> Explain what a b-eautiful number is and what the problem is asking for. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
First, a b-eautiful number n is a positive integer that, when written in base b, has exactly two digits. These two digits (in base b) must sum up to the square root of n. The example given is 81 in base 13, which is written as 63 (since 6*13 + 3 = 81) and 6 + 3 = 9, which is sqrt(81). So, the key points here are:

1. The number n has exactly two digits in base b. That means n must be between b and b² - 1, inclusive. Because the smallest two-digit number in base b is 10_b = b in decimal, and the largest is (b-1)(b^1) + (b-1)(b^0) = b² - 1.
2. The digits of n in base b, let's call them d₁ and d₂ (where d₁ is the first digit and d₂ is the second digit), must satisfy d₁ + d₂ = sqrt(n).
3. The digits d₁ and d₂ must satisfy 0 ≤ d₂ < b and 1 ≤ d₁ ≤ b - 1 (since it's a two-digit number, the first digit can't be zero).
</execution_1.1>
</Execution_1>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
So, the problem reduces to finding all pairs (d₁, d₂) where d₁ and d₂ are digits in base b (with d₁ ≥ 1), such that d₁ + d₂ = sqrt(n), and n = d₁*b + d₂. Then, substituting n into the equation, we get d₁ + d₂ = sqrt(d₁*b + d₂). Let me write that equation out:

<prompt_2.1> Derive the equation relating d₁, d₂, and b from the problem statement. </prompt_2.1>

So, we need to find all pairs (d₁, d₂) where d₁ ≥ 1, d₂ ≥ 0, d₁ ≤ b - 1, d₂ < b, and d₁ + d₂ = sqrt(d₁*b + d₂). Our goal is to find the smallest b such that there are more than ten such numbers, i.e., more than ten pairs (d₁, d₂) satisfying the above equation.

Let me denote S = d₁ + d₂, so S = sqrt(d₁*b + d₂). Then, squaring both sides, we get S² = d₁*b + d₂. But since S = d₁ + d₂, we can substitute that in:

<prompt_2.2> Use the substitution S = d₁ + d₂ and derive an equation involving d₁, d₂, and b. </prompt_2.2>
-----

But let's confirm with another example. Let's take b=16.

<prompt_2.3> Verify the solution for b=16 by finding all valid pairs (d₁, d₂) and ensuring there are more than 10. </prompt_2.3>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
d₁ + d₂ = sqrt(d₁*b + d₂)

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(d₁ + d₂)² = d₁*b + d₂

Expanding the left side:

d₁² + 2*d₁*d₂ + d₂² = d₁*b + d₂

Let me rearrange this equation:

d₁² + 2*d₁*d₂ + d₂² - d₁*b - d₂ = 0

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a better way to approach this. Let's see.

Alternatively, since S = d₁ + d₂, and S² = d₁*b + d₂, we can write d₂ = S² - d₁*b. But since d₂ must be a digit in base b, it must satisfy 0 ≤ d₂ < b. Therefore:

0 ≤ S² - d₁*b < b

Which implies:

d₁*b ≤ S² < d₁*b + b

So, S² must be in the interval [d₁*b, d₁*b + b). Since S = d₁ + d₂, and d₂ is a digit, d₂ can be from 0 to b - 1. Therefore, S can range from d₁ (if d₂ = 0) to d₁ + (b - 1). So, S ∈ [d₁, d₁ + b - 1].

But S² must be in [d₁*b, d₁*b + b). Let's consider the possible values of S for each d₁.

Given that d₁ is an integer from 1 to b - 1, and S = d₁ + d₂, with d₂ from 0 to b - 1, so S can range from d₁ to d₁ + b - 1. Therefore, for each d₁, S can take values from d₁ to d₁ + b - 1, and we need to check if S² is in the interval [d₁*b, d₁*b + b). If it is, then d₂ = S² - d₁*b must be an integer between 0 and b - 1.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
(d₁ + d₂)² = d₁*b + d₂.

Expanding the left side:

d₁² + 2*d₁*d₂ + d₂² = d₁*b + d₂.

Let me rearrange this equation:

d₁² + 2*d₁*d₂ + d₂² - d₁*b - d₂ = 0.

Hmm, this is a quadratic in terms of d₁ and d₂. It might be tricky to solve directly. Maybe we can express d₂ in terms of d₁ and b or vice versa. Let's try to rearrange the equation:

d₁² + 2*d₁*d₂ + d₂² - d₁*b - d₂ = 0.

Let me group terms with d₂:

d₂² + (2*d₁ - 1)*d₂ + (d₁² - d₁*b) = 0.

This is a quadratic equation in d₂. For each d₁, we can solve for d₂:

d₂ = [-(2*d₁ - 1) ± sqrt((2*d₁ - 1)^2 - 4*(d₁² - d₁*b))]/2.

Simplify the discriminant:

Discriminant D = (2*d₁ - 1)^2 - 4*(d₁² - d₁*b)

= 4*d₁² - 4*d₁ + 1 - 4*d₁² + 4*d₁*b

= (-4*d₁ + 1) + 4*d₁*b

= 4*d₁*(b - 1) + 1.

So, D = 4*d₁*(b - 1) + 1.

Therefore, d₂ = [-(2*d₁ - 1) ± sqrt(4*d₁*(b - 1) + 1)] / 2.

Since d₂ must be an integer between 0 and b-1, the expression under the square root must be a perfect square. Let me denote sqrt(D) as k, so k² = 4*d₁*(b - 1) + 1.

Therefore, k must be an integer such that k² ≡ 1 mod 4 (since 4*d₁*(b - 1) is divisible by 4, so k² = 4*m + 1, so k must be odd). Therefore, k is odd. Let me write k = 2*m + 1 for some integer m ≥ 0. Then:

(2*m + 1)^2 = 4*d₁*(b - 1) + 1.

Expanding the left side:

4*m² + 4*m + 1 = 4*d₁*(b - 1) + 1.

Subtract 1 from both sides:

4*m² + 4*m = 4*d₁*(b - 1).

Divide both sides by 4:

m² + m = d₁*(b - 1).

Therefore, d₁ = (m² + m)/(b - 1).

Since d₁ must be a positive integer, (m² + m) must be divisible by (b - 1). Also, since d₁ ≤ b - 1 (as it's a digit in base b), we have:

(m² + m)/(b - 1) ≤ b - 1.

So,

m² + m ≤ (b - 1)^2.

Therefore, m² + m - (b - 1)^2 ≤ 0.

This is a quadratic in m:

m² + m - (b - 1)^2 ≤ 0.

The roots of the quadratic equation m² + m - (b - 1)^2 = 0 are:

m = [-1 ± sqrt(1 + 4*(b - 1)^2)]/2.

Since m is non-negative, we take the positive root:

m = [-1 + sqrt(1 + 4*(b - 1)^2)]/2.

Thus, m must be less than or equal to this value. But since m is an integer, the maximum m can be is the floor of that expression.

Alternatively, since m² + m ≤ (b - 1)^2, we can approximate m as roughly sqrt((b - 1)^2) = b - 1, but m² + m is approximately m², so m is approximately b - 1. But m must be such that m² + m is divisible by (b - 1). Let's denote d = b - 1, so d = b - 1.

Then, m² + m must be divisible by d. So, m(m + 1) ≡ 0 mod d. Since m and m + 1 are consecutive integers, they are coprime. Therefore, one of them must be divisible by d. So either m ≡ 0 mod d or m + 1 ≡ 0 mod d. Therefore, possible solutions for m are m = k*d or m = (k*d) - 1, for some integer k ≥ 0.

But since m² + m ≤ d² (since d = b - 1 and m² + m ≤ d²), let's see:

If m = k*d, then m² + m = k²*d² + k*d. Since k²*d² + k*d ≤ d², this implies k²*d + k ≤ d. Since d ≥ 1 (because b ≥ 2), then k²*d + k ≤ d. For k ≥ 1, this would require k²*d ≤ d, so k² ≤ 1, so k = 1. Then m = d, but m = d would give m² + m = d² + d, which is greater than d², so that's not allowed. Therefore, m = k*d is not possible unless k = 0, which gives m = 0.

If m = (k*d) - 1, then m² + m = (k*d - 1)^2 + (k*d - 1) = k²*d² - 2*k*d + 1 + k*d - 1 = k²*d² - k*d. This must be ≤ d². So:

k²*d² - k*d ≤ d².

Divide both sides by d (since d ≥ 1):

k²*d - k ≤ d.

Rearranged:

k²*d - k - d ≤ 0.

Factor d:

d*(k² - 1) - k ≤ 0.

But since d = b - 1 ≥ 1, and k is a non-negative integer, let's consider possible k values.

For k = 0: m = -1, which is invalid.

For k = 1: m = d - 1.

Then, m² + m = (d - 1)^2 + (d - 1) = d² - 2d + 1 + d - 1 = d² - d.

Which is ≤ d², so that's okay.

For k = 2: m = 2d - 1.

Then, m² + m = (2d - 1)^2 + (2d - 1) = 4d² - 4d + 1 + 2d - 1 = 4d² - 2d.

But 4d² - 2d ≤ d²? That would require 3d² - 2d ≤ 0, which is not possible for d ≥ 1. So k cannot be 2 or higher.

Therefore, the only possible k is 1, leading to m = d - 1.

<execution_2.3>
Then, S can be from 1 to 15. For each S, d₁ can be from 1 to 15, but d₁ must be ≤ 15 (since b=16). Then d₂ = S - d₁. But d₂ must be ≥0 and <16.

So, for each S, d₁ can range from max(1, S - 15) to min(15, S - 0). Let's compute for each S from 1 to 15:

S=1: d₁=1, d₂=0 → valid. So 1 pair.

S=2: d₁=1, d₂=1; d₁=2, d₂=0 → 2 pairs.

Wait, but let me check if d₂ is less than 16. Since S=2, d₁ can be 1 or 2, and d₂=1 or 0, both are valid. So 2 pairs.

Similarly:

S=3: d₁=1,2,3 → d₂=2,1,0 → 3 pairs.

Continuing this way, up to S=15:

For S=15: d₁ can be from 1 to 15, but d₂ = 15 - d₁ must be ≥0. So d₁ can be from 1 to 15, but since d₁ ≤15, and d₂=15 -d₁ ≥0 → d₁ ≤15. So 15 pairs.

But wait, but in reality, when S=15, d₁ can be from 1 to 15, but d₂=15 -d₁ must be <16. Since d₁ is at least 1, d₂ is at most 14, which is okay. So all 15 pairs are valid.

But wait, the problem states that n must be a two-digit number in base b. For b=16, n = d₁*16 + d₂. For S=15, n = d₁*16 + (15 - d₁) = 15*16 + d₁ - d₁ = 15*16 = 240. So n=240, which is a three-digit number in base 16 (F0 in hex), which is invalid. Wait, so there's a mistake here.

Ah, right! Because n must be a two-digit number in base b, so n must be less than b². For b=16, n must be less than 256. But when S=15, n=15*16 + (15 -15)=15*16=240, which is less than 256, so it's a valid two-digit number in base 16. Wait, 15*16 + 0 is 240, which is 0x f0, which is two digits. Wait, but 15 in hex is F, so 15*16 + 0 is F0, which is two digits. So that is valid. Similarly, 15*16 +1=241, which is F1, also two digits. So all S from 1 to 15 give n <256, so they are all two-digit numbers in base 16. Therefore, for b=16, the number of b-eautiful numbers is the sum from S=1 to S=15 of the number of pairs (d₁,d₂) for each S.

For each S, the number of pairs is:

For S=1: 1

S=2: 2

...

S=15: 15

Total: 1+2+...+15 = (15*16)/2 = 120. So there are 120 b-eautiful numbers for b=16, which is way more than 10.

Wait, but this suggests that for b=16, there are 120 numbers. But the problem asks for the least b where there are more than ten. So perhaps b=16 is too big, but maybe a smaller b also has more than 10. Wait, but according to the previous analysis, for b=10, there are 54 numbers. So maybe the answer is 16? But that seems high. Wait, but let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me re-examine.

The key equation is S = sqrt(n), where S = d₁ + d₂, and n = d₁*b + d₂. So S² = d₁*b + d₂. But since d₂ = S - d₁, substituting:

S² = d₁*b + (S - d₁)

S² = d₁*(b - 1) + S

Rearranged:

d₁*(b - 1) = S² - S

Therefore, d₁ = (S² - S)/(b - 1)

Since d₁ must be a positive integer (as it is the first digit), (S² - S) must be divisible by (b - 1), and the result must be an integer between 1 and b - 1, inclusive.

So for each b, we can iterate over possible S values (from 1 to b - 1, since d₁ + d₂ = S, and d₁ ≥1, d₂ ≥0, so S can be at most (b - 1) + (b - 1) = 2b - 2, but actually, since d₂ < b, S can be up to (b - 1) + (b - 1) = 2b - 2. Wait, but when we write n = d₁*b + d₂, since n is a two-digit number in base b, n must be less than b². So S² = n < b², so S < b. Therefore, S can be from 1 to b - 1.

Wait, that's a crucial point. Because n = S², and n must be less than b². Therefore, S² < b² → S < b. So S can be from 1 to b - 1. So for each b, S ranges from 1 to b - 1, and for each S, we check if (S² - S) is divisible by (b - 1), and if so, then d₁ = (S² - S)/(b - 1) must be an integer between 1 and b - 1, and d₂ = S - d₁ must be between 0 and b - 1.

Therefore, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of S in [1, b - 1] such that (S² - S) is divisible by (b - 1), and d₁ = (S² - S)/(b - 1) is an integer in [1, b - 1], and d₂ = S - d₁ is in [0, b - 1].

Therefore, the problem reduces to, for each b starting from 2 upwards, count the number of S in [1, b - 1] such that (S² - S) is divisible by (b - 1), and the resulting d₁ and d₂ satisfy the digit constraints.

So, to find the smallest b where the count exceeds 10, we need to compute for each b starting from 2, the number of valid S, and find the smallest b where this count >10.

Given that for b=16, the count is 120, which is way more than 10, but maybe a much smaller b also has more than 10.

Wait, but according to the previous analysis, for b=10, the count is 54. So maybe the answer is 16, but that seems high. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in assuming that S can go up to b - 1. Wait, S is the sum of the digits, which is d₁ + d₂. Since d₁ can be up to b - 1 and d₂ can be up to b - 1, S can be up to 2b - 2. However, since n = S² must be less than b², because n is a two-digit number in base b, S² < b² → S < b. Therefore, S can be at most b - 1. So S ranges from 1 to b - 1.

Therefore, for each b, S ranges from 1 to b - 1, and for each S, we check if (S² - S) is divisible by (b - 1). If yes, then compute d₁ = (S² - S)/(b - 1), check if d₁ is between 1 and b - 1, and then check if d₂ = S - d₁ is between 0 and b - 1.

Therefore, the number of b-eautiful numbers is the number of valid S in [1, b - 1] satisfying the above conditions.

Therefore, to find the smallest b where this count exceeds 10, we need to compute for each b starting from 2 upwards, the number of valid S, until we find the first b where the count is >10.

Given that for b=16, the count is 120, which is way more than 10, but maybe a smaller b also has more than 10. Let's check for smaller b.

Let's start checking from b=2 upwards.

<Plan_3>
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to find the smallest integer \( b \geq 2 \) such that there are more than ten \( b \)-eautiful numbers. A number \( n \) is \( b \)-eautiful if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \( b \), and the sum of its digits equals \( \sqrt{n} \).

First, let's understand the constraints. If \( n \) is a two-digit number in base \( b \), it can be written as \( n = d_1 \times b + d_2 \), where \( d_1 \) and \( d_2 \) are digits in base \( b \). This means \( d_1 \) ranges from 1 to \( b-1 \) (since it's the leading digit and can't be zero), and \( d_2 \) ranges from 0 to \( b-1 \). The sum of the digits is \( d_1 + d_2 = S \), and according to the problem, this sum \( S \) must equal \( \sqrt{n} \).

So, we have the equation:
\[ S = \sqrt{n} \]
\[ S = d_1 + d_2 \]
\[ n = d_1 \times b + d_2 \]

Substituting \( n \) into the equation \( S = \sqrt{n} \), we get:
\[ (d_1 + d_2)^2 = d_1 \times b + d_2 \]

Let's denote \( S = d_1 + d_2 \). Then:
\[ S^2 = d_1 \times b + d_2 \]

But since \( S = d_1 + d_2 \), we can express \( d_2 = S - d_1 \). Substituting this into the equation:
\[ S^2 = d_1 \times b + (S - d_1) \]
\[ S^2 = d_1 (b - 1) + S \]
\[ d_1 (b - 1) = S^2 - S \]
\[ d_1 = \frac{S^2 - S}{b - 1} \]

Since \( d_1 \) must be an integer between 1 and \( b-1 \), \( \frac{S^2 - S}{b - 1} \) must be an integer in that range. Also, \( d_2 = S - d_1 \) must be a non-negative integer less than \( b \).

So, for each \( b \), we need to find all \( S \) in the range \( 1 \leq S \leq 2b - 2 \) (since \( d_1 + d_2 \leq (b - 1) + (b - 1) = 2b - 2 \)), but actually, since \( n = S^2 \) must be less than \( b^2 \), \( S^2 < b^2 \), so \( S < b \). Therefore, \( S \) ranges from 1 to \( b - 1 \).

For each \( S \) in this range, we check if \( (S^2 - S) \) is divisible by \( (b - 1) \). If yes, then compute \( d_1 = \frac{S^2 - S}{b - 1} \) and check if \( d_1 \) is an integer between 1 and \( b - 1 \), and \( d_2 = S - d_1 \) is between 0 and \( b - 1 \).

Our task is to find the smallest \( b \) such that the number of valid \( S \) values exceeds 10.

To approach this systematically, let's start with smaller values of \( b \) and compute the number of valid \( S \) values until we find the first \( b \) where the count exceeds 10.

- For \( S = 3 \):
  - \( d_1 = (9 - 3)/4 = 1.5 \) invalid.
- For \( S = 4 \):
  - \( d_1 = (16 - 4)/4 = 3 \), valid.
  - \( d_2 = 4 - 3 = 1 \), valid.
- Total valid \( S \): 1.

- \( S \) ranges from 1 to 6.
- For \( S = 1 \):
  - \( d_1 = 0 \) invalid.
- For \( S = 2 \):

- For \( S = 3 \):
  - \( d_1 = (9 - 3)/6 = 1 \), valid.
  - \( d_2 = 3 - 1 = 2 \), valid.

  - \( d_1 = (16 - 4)/6 = 2 \), valid.
  - \( d_2 = 4 - 2 = 2 \), valid.

- Total valid \( S \): 3.
