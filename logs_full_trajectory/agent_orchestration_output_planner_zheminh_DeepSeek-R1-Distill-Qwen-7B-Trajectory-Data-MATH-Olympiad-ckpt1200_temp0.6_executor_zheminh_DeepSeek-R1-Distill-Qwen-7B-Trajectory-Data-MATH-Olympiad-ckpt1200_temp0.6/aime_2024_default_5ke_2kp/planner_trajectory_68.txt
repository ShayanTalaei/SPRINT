<Question>
Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.

<Plan_1>
Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this game where they take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens from a stack of n tokens. Alice goes first, and the person who takes the last token wins. We need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays. Hmm, let's try to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that these types of games are called impartial games, and they can often be analyzed using the concept of winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does, and a losing position is the opposite—no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

<prompt_1.1> Analyze the game rules and determine if it is an impartial game. Then, define winning and losing positions in the context of this game. </prompt_1.1>

<execution_1.1>
So, in this problem, we need to identify all n ≤ 2024 where Bob can win. Since Alice goes first, if the starting position (n) is a losing position, then Bob can win. Therefore, we need to find all n where the first player (Alice) is in a losing position, which means Bob has a winning strategy.

To approach this, maybe we can start by figuring out the losing positions. Let's denote the losing positions as L and winning positions as W. We need to find the pattern of L and W for different n. Let's start with small values of n and see if we can find a pattern.

Let's list out n from 0 upwards and determine for each n whether it's a losing or winning position. Wait, but n starts at 1, right? The problem says positive integers n ≤ 2024. So n can be 1, 2, 3, ...., 2024. Let's start with n=0 as a base case—if there are 0 tokens, the game is over, so the previous player has won. But since the game starts with n ≥ 1, maybe n=0 isn't considered here. Let's see. If a player is faced with n=0, they lose because they can't make a move. So in terms of game positions, n=0 is a losing position. But since the game starts at n ≥1, we need to consider n=1,2,...,2024.

Let me try to build a table for small n to see if a pattern emerges.

Let's define f(n) = 1 if the current player can force a win, and 0 if they cannot (i.e., it's a losing position). So f(n) = 1 if the current player can win, 0 otherwise.

Base case: f(0) = 0 (losing position).

Now, for each n ≥1, the current player can remove 1 or 4 tokens. So, the player can move to n-1 or n-4. If either of those moves leads to a losing position for the opponent, then the current position is a winning position. Otherwise, it's a losing position.

So, the recursive relation is:

f(n) = 1 if f(n-1) = 0 or f(n-4) = 0 (i.e., the player can move to a losing position for the opponent)

f(n) = 0 otherwise (i.e., all moves lead to winning positions for the opponent)

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Let's compute f(n) step by step for n from 1 upwards.

<prompt_2.1> Using the recursive relation, compute f(n) for n from 1 to 10 and identify losing positions. </prompt_2.1>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Let's start:

n=0: f(0)=0

n=1: Can remove 1 token, leading to n=0 (a losing position). So f(1)=1.

n=2: Can remove 1 token, leading to n=1 (winning). So f(2)=1.

n=3: Can remove 1 token, leading to n=2 (winning). So f(3)=1.

n=4: Can remove 1 token (to n=3, which is winning) or 4 tokens (to n=0, losing). Since removing 4 tokens leads to a losing position for the opponent, f(4)=1.

n=5: Can remove 1 token (to n=4, winning) or 4 tokens (to n=1, winning). Both moves lead to winning positions for the opponent. So f(5)=0. So n=5 is a losing position.

n=6: Can remove 1 token (to n=5, losing) or 4 tokens (to n=2, winning). Since removing 1 token leads to a losing position for the opponent, f(6)=1.

n=7: Can remove 1 token (to n=6, winning) or 4 tokens (to n=3, winning). Both lead to winning positions. So f(7)=0. Losing position.

n=8: Can remove 1 token (to n=7, losing) or 4 tokens (to n=4, winning). Removing 1 token leads to a losing position, so f(8)=1.

n=9: Can remove 1 token (to n=8, winning) or 4 tokens (to n=5, losing). Removing 4 tokens leads to a losing position, so f(9)=1.

n=10: Can remove 1 token (to n=9, winning) or 4 tokens (to n=6, winning). Both moves lead to winning positions. So f(10)=0. Losing position.

Hmm, so the losing positions so far are n=5,7,10. Let's see if there's a pattern here. Let's compute a few more to see.

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
n=11: Can remove 1 token (to n=10, losing) or 4 tokens (to n=7, losing).

<prompt_3.1> Continue computing f(n) for n up to 15 and identify the losing positions. </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
Wait, so removing either 1 or 4 tokens leads to a losing position for the opponent. Therefore, f(11)=1. But wait, if n=10 is losing, then removing 1 token from 11 leads to 10, which is losing. So the current player can force the opponent into a losing position. So f(11)=1. Similarly, removing 4 tokens from 11 leads to 7, which is also losing. So both moves lead to losing positions, so f(11)=1. Wait, that can't be. If both moves lead to losing positions, then the current player can choose either move, so f(11)=1. Wait, but that contradicts the earlier pattern. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, n=10 is losing. So if n=11, removing 1 token leads to n=10 (losing). Therefore, the current player can win by moving to n=10. So f(11)=1. Similarly, removing 4 tokens from 11 leads to n=7 (losing), so the current player can also choose that move. So regardless of the move, the current player can win. Therefore, f(11)=1.

Wait, but that contradicts the earlier idea that losing positions are n=5,7,10. Let me check again.

Wait, let me re-examine the earlier steps.

Wait, n=5: losing.

n=6: can move to n=5 (losing), so f(6)=1.

n=7: can move to n=6 (winning) or n=3 (winning). So f(7)=0.

n=8: can move to n=7 (losing), so f(8)=1.

n=9: can move to n=8 (winning) or n=5 (losing). So f(9)=1.

n=10: can move to n=9 (winning) or n=6 (winning). So f(10)=0.

n=11: can move to n=10 (losing) or n=7 (losing). So f(11)=1.

n=12: can move to n=11 (winning) or n=8 (winning). So f(12)=0.

Wait, so n=12 is losing. So the losing positions so far are n=5,7,10,12.

Wait, let's check n=13:

n=13: can move to n=12 (losing) or n=9 (winning). So f(13)=1.

n=14: can move to n=13 (winning) or n=10 (losing). So f(14)=1.

n=15: can move to n=14 (winning) or n=11 (winning). So f(15)=0. Losing position.

So the losing positions are n=5,7,10,12,15. Let's see if there's a pattern here. Let's list them:

5,7,10,12,15.

The differences between them: 7-5=2, 10-7=3, 12-10=2, 15-12=3. So alternating differences of 2 and 3. Hmm, maybe the losing positions are numbers congruent to 2 mod 5? Wait, 5 mod 5 is 0, 7 mod 5 is 2, 10 mod 5 is 0, 12 mod 5 is 2, 15 mod 5 is 0. Wait, that's inconsistent. Alternatively, maybe they are numbers of the form 5k + 2 or 5k + 5? Let's check:

5=5*1 +0, 7=5*1 +2, 10=5*2 +0, 12=5*2 +2, 15=5*3 +0. Hmm, so every time, the losing positions are multiples of 5 and multiples of 5 plus 2. Wait, but 5 is 5*1 +0, 7 is 5*1 +2, 10 is 5*2 +0, 12 is 5*2 +2, 15 is 5*3 +0. So the losing positions are numbers where n ≡0 or 2 mod5. Let's check if that's the case.

Wait, let's check n=17:

n=17: If n=17, can remove 1 to get 16 (which would be 16 mod5=1, so if 16 is a winning position, then removing 1 would leave the opponent in a winning position. Alternatively, remove 4 tokens to get 13, which is 13 mod5=3. Wait, but according to our previous pattern, if n=17 is 17 mod5=2, which is a losing position. So f(17)=0. Let's compute f(17) step by step.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me try a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the losing positions are those numbers where n ≡0 or 2 mod5. Let's check:

n=0: 0 mod5=0, losing.

n=2: 2 mod5=2, losing.

n=5:5 mod5=0, losing.

n=7:7 mod5=2, losing.

n=10:10 mod5=0, losing.

n=12:12 mod5=2, losing.

n=15:15 mod5=0, losing.

n=17:17 mod5=2, losing.

n=20:20 mod5=0, losing.

So this seems to fit. So perhaps the losing positions are n ≡0 or 2 mod5. Then, the winning positions are n ≡1,3,4 mod5.

Wait, but let's check n=5: if n=5 is losing, then n=6 is winning (can move to 5). n=7 is losing (can only move to 6 or 3, both winning). n=8 is winning (can move to 7, which is losing). n=9 is winning (can move to 5, which is losing). n=10 is losing (can only move to 9 or 6, both winning). n=11 is winning (can move to 10, which is losing). n=12 is losing (can move to 11 or 8, both winning). n=13 is winning (can move to 12, which is losing). n=14 is winning (can move to 13 or 10, both winning). Wait, no: n=14 can remove 4 tokens to get to 10, which is losing. So n=14 is winning. Wait, but according to our previous assumption, n=14 mod5=4, which should be a winning position. So that fits. Similarly, n=15 is losing (mod5=0). n=16:16 mod5=1, winning. n=17:2 mod5=2, losing. So this seems consistent.

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
Therefore, if the losing positions are n ≡0 or 2 mod5, then the number of losing positions less than or equal to 2024 would be the number of n ≤2024 where n ≡0 or 2 mod5.

Therefore, the number of losing positions is equal to the number of n ≤2024 where n ≡0 or 2 mod5. Therefore, the number of such n is the number of integers from 1 to 2024 inclusive that are congruent to 0 or 2 modulo5.

<prompt_4.1> Calculate the number of integers ≤2024 that are congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5, and determine how this relates to the number of losing positions. </prompt_4.1>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
To compute this, let's find how many numbers ≤2024 are ≡0 mod5 and how many are ≡2 mod5.

First, numbers ≡0 mod5: the sequence is 5,10,15,..., up to the largest multiple of5 ≤2024.

Similarly, numbers ≡2 mod5: 2,7,12,17,..., up to the largest number ≤2024.

Let's compute the number of terms in each sequence.

For ≡0 mod5:

The first term is 5, last term is floor(2024/5)*5. Let's compute 2024 ÷5. 5*404=2020, so 2020 is the largest multiple of5 ≤2024. So the number of terms is 404. Because 5*1=5, 5*2=10,....,5*404=2020. So 404 terms.

For ≡2 mod5:

First term is 2, then 7,12,..., up to the largest number ≤2024. Let's find the largest number ≡2 mod5 ≤2024.

2024 ÷5=404.8, so 5*404=2020. Then 2020 +2=2022. So the last term is 2022. Then the sequence is 2,7,12,...,2022.

Number of terms: Let's compute the number of terms in the arithmetic sequence starting at 2, with common difference5, up to2022.

The nth term is 2 + (n-1)*5 ≤2022.

So 2 +5(n-1) ≤2022

5(n-1) ≤2020

n-1 ≤404

n ≤405.

So there are405 terms for ≡2 mod5.

Therefore, total losing positions would be404 +405=809.

Wait, but wait: the problem states that Bob can win if the starting position is a losing position. So the number of n ≤2024 where the starting position is losing is809. Therefore, the answer is809.

But let's verify this.

Wait, but let's check with the earlier examples. For n=5,7,10,12,15,17, etc. So 5,7,10,12,15,17,... up to2020 and2022.

Wait, but wait, when we count numbers ≡0 mod5 up to2024, the last term is2020, which is included. Similarly, numbers ≡2 mod5 up to2022, which is included. So total terms:404 +405=809. So the answer should be809.

But let's check with smaller n.

For example, n=1:1 mod5=1, which is a winning position. Alice can take1 and win. So Bob cannot win. So n=1 is a winning position, so not counted.

n=2: ≡2 mod5, so losing position. So Bob can win. So n=2 is counted. Similarly, n=5: losing position, counted. n=7: losing, counted. n=10: losing, counted. So seems correct.

Therefore, the number of losing positions is809. Therefore, the number of n ≤2024 where Bob can force a win is809.
