Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. Hmm, so we have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH, with points D, E, C, F collinear. Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC=16, AB=107, FG=17, and EF=184. We need to find the length of CE.

<execution_1.1>
First, let me visualize the setup. Since ABCD and EFGH are rectangles, their opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. The fact that D, E, C, F are collinear means they lie on a straight line. So, points D and C are opposite corners of rectangle ABCD, and E and F are opposite corners of rectangle EFGH, lying on the same line. Also, A, D, H, G are concyclic, meaning they lie on a circle. That might be useful for some cyclic quadrilateral properties.

Given the lengths: BC=16, AB=107, FG=17, EF=184. Wait, BC is a side of rectangle ABCD. Since ABCD is a rectangle, BC is the width and AB is the length. So, AB=107 is the length, BC=16 is the width. Similarly, FG=17 and EF=184. In rectangle EFGH, EF is the length and FG is the width. So, EF=184 is the length, FG=17 is the width. Therefore, the dimensions of the rectangles are ABCD: 107x16, EFGH: 184x17.

Now, points D, E, C, F are collinear. Let me try to sketch this mentally. Let's consider rectangle ABCD with AB horizontal and BC vertical. So, points A, B, C, D would be arranged such that AB is horizontal, BC is vertical upwards, CD is horizontal to the left, and DA is vertical downwards. Then, rectangle EFGH is somewhere else, but with points E, F, G, H. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, that line must pass through D and C, which are opposite corners of rectangle ABCD. So, line DC is a diagonal of rectangle ABCD. Therefore, points E and F must lie on the line DC. Wait, but E and F are corners of rectangle EFGH. So, rectangle EFGH has its side EF along line DC? Or maybe not necessarily along the entire length, but just the line DC.

But since E and F are opposite corners of rectangle EFGH, then EF is the diagonal of the rectangle EFGH. Wait, but EF is given as 184. Since EFGH is a rectangle, its diagonal can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem. If FG=17 and EF=184, then the diagonal EG (or FH) should be sqrt(17^2 + 184^2). Let me compute that: 17^2=289, 184^2=33856, so sqrt(289 + 33856) = sqrt(34145). Let me see, 34145. Hmm, not sure if that's a perfect square. Let me check: 185^2=34225, which is more than 34145. So, sqrt(34145) is approximately 184.7, but maybe exact value isn't needed here.

But wait, if EF is a diagonal of rectangle EFGH, and E and F are on line DC, which is a diagonal of rectangle ABCD. So, DC is the diagonal of ABCD, with length sqrt(AB^2 + BC^2) = sqrt(107^2 + 16^2). Let me compute that: 107^2=11449, 16^2=256, so sqrt(11449 + 256)=sqrt(11705). Hmm, sqrt(11705). Let me see, 108^2=11664, 109^2=11881, so sqrt(11705) is between 108 and 109. Approximately 108.19. But again, not sure if exact value is needed.

But the key point is that E and F are on line DC, which is the diagonal of ABCD. So, line DC is the same as line EF (since E and F are on DC). Therefore, the diagonal DC of ABCD is the same line as the diagonal EF of EFGH. Wait, but EF is a diagonal of EFGH, so EF is the diagonal of EFGH, which is equal in length to sqrt(17^2 + 184^2), as calculated earlier. However, DC is the diagonal of ABCD, which is sqrt(107^2 + 16^2). Therefore, if EF and DC are the same line, their lengths must be equal? But that can't be, since sqrt(107^2 +16^2) ≈108.19 and sqrt(17^2 +184^2)≈184.7. So, this seems contradictory.

Wait, maybe I have a misunderstanding here. Let me clarify. The problem states that D, E, C, F are collinear. So, E and F are points on the line DC. But EFGH is a rectangle, so E and F are two adjacent corners? Wait, no. In rectangle EFGH, the vertices are E, F, G, H. So, EF is a side of the rectangle, not a diagonal. Wait, hold on. Wait, in a rectangle, consecutive vertices are connected by sides, so EF is a side, FG is another side, etc. So, EF and FG are adjacent sides. So, EF is a side of length 184, FG is a side of length 17. Therefore, the diagonal of EFGH would be sqrt(184^2 +17^2) as I thought earlier.

But the problem says D, E, C, F are collinear. So, points D and C are opposite corners of ABCD, so DC is a diagonal of ABCD. Then, E and F are on DC. But in rectangle EFGH, EF is a side. So, EF is a side of length 184, which is part of the line DC. Therefore, the side EF of rectangle EFGH is lying along the diagonal DC of rectangle ABCD. Similarly, FG is a side of EFGH, which is perpendicular to EF, so FG is vertical or horizontal, depending on the orientation.

But since D, E, C, F are collinear, and EFGH is a rectangle, then the rectangle EFGH must be such that one of its sides (EF) is along DC, and the other side (FG) is perpendicular to DC. But DC is the diagonal of ABCD, which is at an angle. Therefore, FG must be perpendicular to DC.

But also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic. That might be useful. Let me recall that in a cyclic quadrilateral, the opposite angles sum to 180 degrees. Alternatively, using power of a point or other circle theorems.

Hmm, so maybe we can use coordinate geometry here. Let me try setting up coordinates for the points. Let's place rectangle ABCD in the coordinate plane. Let me set point D at the origin (0,0). Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, with AB=107 and BC=16, the coordinates would be: D(0,0), C(107,0), B(107,16), A(0,16). Wait, no. Wait, if ABCD is a rectangle, then starting from D(0,0), moving along DC to C(107,0), then up to B(107,16), then left to A(0,16), and back to D(0,0). Wait, but BC is 16, which is the vertical side. So, AB is 107, which is the horizontal side. So, yes, that setup works.

So, coordinates:

D(0,0)

C(107,0)

B(107,16)

A(0,16)

Now, rectangle EFGH is such that E and F are on line DC. Since DC is from (107,0) to (0,0). Wait, DC is from D(0,0) to C(107,0). Wait, no, DC is from D(0,0) to C(107,0)? Wait, in the rectangle ABCD, DC is the side from D(0,0) to C(107,0)? Wait, no. Wait, in rectangle ABCD, sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. So, AB is from A(0,16) to B(107,16), BC is from B(107,16) to C(107,0), CD is from C(107,0) to D(0,0), and DA is from D(0,0) to A(0,16). Wait, so DC is from C(107,0) to D(0,0). So, DC is the diagonal from (107,0) to (0,0). Wait, but DC is a diagonal of ABCD, which is a rectangle. Wait, but in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other. So, DC is a diagonal of length sqrt(107^2 +16^2) ≈108.19, as before.

But the problem states that D, E, C, F are collinear. So, points D, E, C, F lie on a straight line. But in our coordinate system, D(0,0), C(107,0), so DC is the horizontal line from (0,0) to (107,0). Wait, but in that case, DC is horizontal, but in rectangle ABCD, DC is actually the diagonal from D(0,0) to C(107,0). Wait, no. Wait, in rectangle ABCD, DC is the side from D(0,0) to C(107,0). Wait, but in that case, ABCD would have sides AB=107 (horizontal), BC=16 (vertical), CD=107 (horizontal), DA=16 (vertical). Wait, but then ABCD would be a rectangle with length 107 and width 16. But in that case, DC is a horizontal side, not a diagonal.

Wait, maybe I messed up the coordinates. Let me clarify. Let's define rectangle ABCD with AB=107 (length), BC=16 (width). So, if we place point A at (0,0), then B would be at (107,0), C at (107,16), D at (0,16). Then, DC would be from D(0,16) to C(107,16), which is a horizontal line. Then, DA is from D(0,16) to A(0,0), vertical. Wait, but in that case, DC is horizontal, same as AB. Then, the diagonal of ABCD would be AC or BD. So, maybe I need to adjust the coordinate system.

Alternatively, perhaps DC is the diagonal. Let's think again. If ABCD is a rectangle with AB=107, BC=16, then the sides are AB=107, BC=16, CD=107, DA=16. Then, the diagonals AC and BD are equal, each of length sqrt(107^2 +16^2). So, DC is a side, not a diagonal. Therefore, if D, E, C, F are collinear, then they lie on the side DC, which is from D(0,0) to C(107,0), assuming DC is the horizontal side. But in the problem statement, it says D, E, C, F are collinear. So, if DC is a side, then E and F are on that side. But then, rectangle EFGH has points E and F on DC, and EF is a side of length 184. But DC is only 107 units long. So, EF being 184 would not fit on DC. Therefore, this suggests that DC is actually a diagonal of ABCD, not a side.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust the coordinate system. Let's consider that DC is the diagonal of ABCD. So, in rectangle ABCD, the diagonal DC has length sqrt(AB^2 + BC^2) = sqrt(107^2 +16^2) ≈108.19. Then, points D, E, C, F are collinear along this diagonal. So, in this case, DC is the diagonal from D to C, which is sqrt(107^2 +16^2). Then, E and F are points along this diagonal. So, the diagonal DC is divided into three segments: DE, EF, FC. Since E and F are on DC, and EF is a side of rectangle EFGH. But EF is given as 184. So, EF is a side of EFGH, which is a rectangle. So, EF is 184, FG is 17, so the other side is 17.

But the diagonal DC is only approximately 108.19, so EF being 184 is longer than DC. That can't be. So, this suggests that my initial assumption is wrong. Therefore, perhaps DC is not the diagonal, but a side? Wait, but DC is a side of ABCD. Wait, in a rectangle, the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. So, DC is a side. Therefore, if DC is a side of ABCD, then its length is either AB=107 or BC=16. Wait, in rectangle ABCD, DC is opposite to AB. If AB=107, then DC=107. If BC=16, then AD=16. So, DC is a horizontal side if AB is horizontal. Therefore, DC is 107 units long. Then, EF is a side of EFGH, which is 184 units. So, EF=184 is longer than DC=107. Therefore, EF cannot lie entirely on DC. Therefore, this seems impossible. Therefore, perhaps DC is the diagonal of ABCD. Wait, but in that case, DC would be sqrt(107^2 +16^2) ≈108.19, which is still less than 184. Therefore, EF=184 cannot lie on DC. Therefore, this seems contradictory.

Wait, maybe my coordinate system is wrong. Let's try to visualize again. Let's suppose that ABCD is a rectangle with AB=107, BC=16. So, AB is the length, BC is the width. Then, DC is the side from D to C, which is the same as AB, so DC=107. Therefore, if E and F are on DC, then EF cannot be 184. Therefore, this is impossible. Therefore, perhaps DC is the diagonal of ABCD. But in that case, DC would be sqrt(107^2 +16^2). Then, EF=184 is longer than DC. Therefore, EF cannot lie on DC. Therefore, this suggests that the problem may have a different configuration.

Alternatively, maybe the rectangles are arranged such that EFGH is not lying on DC, but E and F are on DC, but EF is not a side of EFGH. Wait, but in rectangle EFGH, EF is a side. So, if EF is a side, then it must be aligned with the sides of the rectangle. Therefore, EF is either horizontal or vertical. But DC is the diagonal of ABCD, which is at an angle. Therefore, EF being a side of EFGH must be aligned with DC. Therefore, EF is along DC, but EF is longer than DC, which is impossible. Therefore, this suggests that maybe I need to reorient the coordinate system.

Alternatively, perhaps DC is the diagonal of EFGH? But EF is a side of EFGH, and EF=184. If DC is the diagonal of EFGH, then the diagonal of EFGH would be sqrt(184^2 +17^2) ≈184.7, which is longer than DC if DC is the diagonal of ABCD (≈108.19). Therefore, this also doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the problem is that DC is the diagonal of ABCD, and EF is a side of EFGH lying along DC. But EF=184 is longer than DC≈108.19, which is impossible. Therefore, there must be a different interpretation.

Wait, perhaps the problem states that D, E, C, F are collinear, but not necessarily in the order D-E-C-F or D-F-C-E. Maybe the order is different? For example, E and F could be on DC extended beyond C or D. So, maybe DC is a line, and E and F are on that line, but not necessarily between D and C. For example, E could be on DC extended beyond C, and F beyond E, or something like that. Then, EF could be longer than DC. Let me consider that possibility.

So, if DC is the diagonal of ABCD, which is approximately 108.19, and EF is a side of EFGH, which is 184, then EF could be on the line DC extended beyond C. So, E and F are on the line DC, with E between D and C, and F beyond C such that EF=184. Similarly, maybe D-E-C-F with E between D and C, and F beyond C. Then, DE + EC = DC ≈108.19, and EF=184. Then, DF = DE + EC + CF. But not sure yet.

But the key is that points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic. Let's recall that in a cyclic quadrilateral, the product of the lengths of the diagonals can be related to the sum of the products of opposite sides. But maybe more useful here is the power of a point or some angle relations.

Alternatively, since ADHG is cyclic, the angles subtended by the same chord should be equal. For example, angle ADH should be equal to angle AGH, or something like that. Wait, maybe using coordinates is the way to go here.

Let me try to set up a coordinate system again. Let's place point D at (0,0). Then, since ABCD is a rectangle with AB=107, BC=16. If we consider DC as the diagonal, then point C would be at (107,0), but wait, no. Wait, if D is at (0,0), and DC is the diagonal, then point C would be at (107,0), but then AB=107 would be the horizontal side. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to define the coordinate system properly.

Let me place point D at (0,0). Let’s assume that DC is the diagonal of rectangle ABCD. Then, since DC is the diagonal, point C would be at (a,b) such that the length DC is sqrt(a^2 + b^2). Similarly, ABCD is a rectangle, so AB and BC are the sides. If AB=107 and BC=16, then AB is the horizontal side, BC is the vertical side. Therefore, if D is at (0,0), then A would be at (0,16), B at (107,16), and C at (107,0). Wait, but then DC would be from (0,0) to (107,0), which is horizontal, not diagonal. Therefore, this contradicts the assumption that DC is the diagonal.

Therefore, perhaps DC is the diagonal of ABCD. Therefore, if D is at (0,0), then C would be at (107,16), making DC the diagonal of length sqrt(107^2 +16^2). Then, ABCD would have sides AB=107 and BC=16. Wait, but in that case, AB would be the side from A(0,16) to B(107,16), which is 107 units, and BC would be from B(107,16) to C(107,0), which is 16 units. Then, CD is from C(107,0) to D(0,0), which is 107 units. Wait, but that would make DC=107 units, not the diagonal. Therefore, this is contradictory.

Wait, I think there's a confusion here. In a rectangle, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other. So, if ABCD is a rectangle with AB=107 and BC=16, then the diagonals AC and BD are equal. The length of the diagonal is sqrt(107^2 +16^2) ≈108.19. Therefore, DC is the diagonal, so DC is approximately 108.19 units. Therefore, points D, E, C, F are collinear along DC. So, DC is the diagonal from D(0,0) to C(107,16), right? Wait, no. Wait, if AB=107 and BC=16, then in standard coordinates, if we place D at (0,0), then A is (0,16), B is (107,16), C is (107,0), and back to D(0,0). Wait, but then DC is from (107,0) to (0,0), which is along the x-axis, length 107. So, DC is a side, not a diagonal. Therefore, the diagonal would be AC from (0,16) to (107,0), which has length sqrt(107^2 +16^2). Therefore, the problem says D, E, C, F are collinear. If DC is the side from D(0,0) to C(107,0), then E and F are on DC. But EF is 184, which is longer than DC. Therefore, impossible. Therefore, this suggests that DC must be the diagonal.

Therefore, perhaps the rectangle is rotated. Let me consider that. Let's suppose that rectangle ABCD has sides AB=107 and BC=16, but is placed such that DC is the diagonal. Therefore, points D(0,0), C(107,16), so DC is the diagonal. Then, ABCD is a rectangle with sides AB and BC. Therefore, point A would be at (0,16), and B would be at (107,16). Wait, but then AB is from (0,16) to (107,16), which is 107 units, and BC is from (107,16) to (107,16+16)= (107,32). Wait, no, BC is supposed to be 16 units. Wait, this is getting confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the rectangle is placed such that DC is the diagonal. Let me assign coordinates accordingly. Let me place D at (0,0). Let’s suppose that DC is the diagonal of the rectangle, so point C is at (a,b), and the sides DA and DC are the diagonals. Wait, no. Wait, in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other. So, if DC is the diagonal, then DA and CB are the sides. Wait, this is getting too confusing. Let me try a different approach.

Let me consider that in rectangle ABCD, AB=107, BC=16. Therefore, AB is the length, BC is the width. Then, the sides are AB=107, BC=16, CD=107, DA=16. The diagonals AC and BD are equal, each of length sqrt(107^2 +16^2). Therefore, if we place point D at (0,0), then point C would be at (107,16), because moving 107 units along x-axis and 16 units up along y-axis. Then, point A would be at (0,16), and point B at (107,16). Therefore, DC is from (0,0) to (107,16), which is the diagonal. Then, the side DA is from (0,0) to (0,16), which is 16 units. Then, AB is from (0,16) to (107,16), which is 107 units. Then, BC is from (107,16) to (107,0), which is 16 units. Then, CD is from (107,0) to (0,0), which is 107 units. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because CD should be the same as AB, which is 107. But in this coordinate system, CD is from (107,0) to (0,0), which is 107 units along the x-axis. Wait, but if DC is the diagonal from (0,0) to (107,16), then CD would be from (107,16) to (0,0), which is the diagonal. Wait, no. Wait, in rectangle ABCD, the order is important. So, ABCD is a rectangle with vertices in order A, B, C, D. So, if we have D at (0,0), then moving to C would be along DC, which is a diagonal. Wait, this is getting too confusing. Let me try to clearly define coordinates.

Let me define the rectangle ABCD with coordinates:

Let’s place point D at (0,0). Since DC is a diagonal, point C must be at (x,y) such that DC has length sqrt(x^2 + y^2). But in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other. So, if ABCD is a rectangle with AB=107 and BC=16, then the sides AB and BC are 107 and 16. Therefore, if AB is 107, then AB is a horizontal side. So, from point A to point B is 107 units. Similarly, BC is 16 units, vertical side. Therefore, if D is at (0,0), then point C would be at (107,16). Then, DA would be the vertical side from D(0,0) to A(0,16). Then, AB is from A(0,16) to B(107,16), which is 107 units. Then, BC is from B(107,16) to C(107,16+16)= (107,32). Wait, but BC is supposed to be 16 units. Therefore, this suggests that BC is vertical from B(107,16) to C(107,16+16)= (107,32), which is 16 units. Then, CD is from C(107,32) to D(0,0), which is the diagonal. Therefore, DC is the diagonal from D(0,0) to C(107,32). Then, the length DC is sqrt(107^2 +32^2). But in the problem, DC is the diagonal of ABCD, which should be equal to the other diagonal. The other diagonal is from A(0,16) to B(107,16), which is 107 units. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal. So, diagonals AC and BD should be equal. Wait, in this coordinate system, diagonal AC is from A(0,16) to C(107,32), which has length sqrt(107^2 + (32-16)^2) = sqrt(107^2 +16^2). Similarly, diagonal BD is from B(107,16) to D(0,0), which is sqrt(107^2 +16^2). Therefore, both diagonals are equal, which is correct. Therefore, DC is not a diagonal, but a side? Wait, DC is from D(0,0) to C(107,32), which is the diagonal. Wait, but in this coordinate system, DC is the diagonal of the rectangle. Therefore, the problem states that D, E, C, F are collinear, meaning they lie on DC, which is the diagonal. Then, E and F are points on DC. Then, EF is a side of rectangle EFGH, which has EF=184, FG=17. Then, since EFGH is a rectangle, EF and FG are adjacent sides, so they should be perpendicular. Therefore, EF is along DC, and FG is perpendicular to DC. But DC has a slope of (32-0)/(107-0) =32/107. Therefore, FG would have a slope of -107/32 to be perpendicular. Then, the coordinates of G and H can be determined based on this.

But then, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, quadrilateral ADGH is cyclic. Therefore, the four points A(0,16), D(0,0), H, G must lie on a circle. Let's try to find coordinates for G and H.

First, let's parameterize points E and F on DC. Let's let DC be parametrized as t*(107,32) where t ranges from 0 to1. So, any point on DC can be written as (107t,32t). Then, E and F are points on DC such that EF=184. Since DC is the diagonal of length sqrt(107^2 +32^2). Let's compute that length: sqrt(107^2 +32^2) = sqrt(11449 +1024) = sqrt(12473) ≈111.68. Wait, 107^2 is 11449, 32^2 is 1024, sum is 12473. sqrt(12473) ≈111.68. Wait, but EF is given as 184, which is longer than DC≈111.68. Therefore, EF cannot lie on DC. Therefore, this is impossible. Therefore, this suggests that my coordinate system is wrong.

Wait, so perhaps DC is not the diagonal, but a side? Wait, in rectangle ABCD, sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. If DC is a side, then DC is equal to AB=107. Then, EF=184 is a side of EFGH, which would be longer than DC. Therefore, EF cannot lie on DC. Therefore, this is a contradiction. Therefore, the problem must have a different configuration.

Wait, maybe the rectangles are arranged such that EFGH is rotated with respect to ABCD. Let me think. Suppose that EFGH is a rectangle with EF=184 and FG=17. Then, EF is one side, FG is another. Then, the diagonal of EFGH would be sqrt(184^2 +17^2) ≈184.7. Then, if E and F are on DC, which is a side of ABCD, then EF=184 is longer than DC? If DC is a side of ABCD, then DC=107, so EF=184>107, which is impossible. Therefore, DC must be the diagonal of EFGH? Wait, but DC is a diagonal of ABCD, not EFGH. Therefore, this seems conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps DC is a diagonal of EFGH. If EFGH is a rectangle with diagonal DC, then DC would be sqrt(184^2 +17^2) ≈184.7. Then, DC is the diagonal of ABCD, which is sqrt(107^2 +16^2)≈108.19. Therefore, DC cannot be both the diagonal of ABCD and the diagonal of EFGH. Therefore, this is impossible. Therefore, I must be making a mistake in the interpretation.

Wait, perhaps the problem states that D, E, C, F are collinear, but not necessarily in the order D-E-C-F. Maybe the order is D-F-C-E or something else. Let me assume that E and F are on DC extended beyond C and D. So, for example, D----F----C----E, where DF + FC + CE = DC. But then, EF would be FC + CE. But EF is given as 184. However, DC is approximately 108.19, so FC + CE would be 184, which is impossible. Therefore, this is not possible.

Alternatively, maybe DC is not a straight line, but a curve. Wait, no, ABCD and EFGH are rectangles, so their sides are straight lines. Therefore, DC must be a straight line. Therefore, this suggests that perhaps the problem is designed such that DC is the diagonal of ABCD, and E and F are on DC, but EF is a side of EFGH, which is perpendicular to DC. Therefore, EF is perpendicular to DC. Therefore, EF is a line segment of length 184 perpendicular to DC at some point along DC. Then, since E and F are on DC, EF is a line segment perpendicular to DC with length 184. Then, FG is a side of EFGH, which is 17 units. Since EFGH is a rectangle, FG is perpendicular to EF. Therefore, FG is along the direction perpendicular to EF. But EF is perpendicular to DC, so FG would be parallel to DC. Therefore, FG is parallel to DC. Therefore, the rectangle EFGH has sides EF perpendicular to DC and FG parallel to DC.

Now, since A, D, H, G are on a circle, we can use the property that in a cyclic quadrilateral, the product of the lengths of the diagonals can be related to the sum of the products of opposite sides. But maybe it's easier to use coordinates.

Let me attempt to set up coordinates again. Let me place point D at (0,0). Let’s assume that DC is the diagonal of rectangle ABCD, which is from D(0,0) to C(a,b). Then, ABCD is a rectangle with sides AB=107 and BC=16. Therefore, the length DC is sqrt(a^2 + b^2). The sides DA and CB are vertical sides of length 16, and AB and CD are horizontal sides of length 107. Wait, but in that case, DC would be a diagonal, so the horizontal component would be 107, and the vertical component would be 16. Therefore, if DC is the diagonal, then a=107 and b=16, so DC is from (0,0) to (107,16). Then, ABCD has vertices at D(0,0), C(107,16), B(107,16+16)= (107,32), A(0,32). Wait, but then DA is from D(0,0) to A(0,32), which is 32 units, but BC is from B(107,32) to C(107,16), which is 16 units. Therefore, this contradicts AB=107. Therefore, this coordinate system is not correct.

Alternatively, let's place point D at (0,0), point C at (107,0), making DC a horizontal diagonal of length 107. Then, DA
