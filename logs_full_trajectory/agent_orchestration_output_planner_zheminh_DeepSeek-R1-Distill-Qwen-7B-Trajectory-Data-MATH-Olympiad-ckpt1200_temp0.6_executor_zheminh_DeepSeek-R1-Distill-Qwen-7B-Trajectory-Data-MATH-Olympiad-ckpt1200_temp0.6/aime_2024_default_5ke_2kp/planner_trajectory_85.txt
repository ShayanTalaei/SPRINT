Okay, so I need to find the side length of a convex equilateral hexagon ABCDEF where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. Additionally, the triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me visualize the hexagon. It's convex and equilateral, meaning all its sides are equal in length. Also, opposite sides are parallel. So AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA. That gives me some symmetry to work with.

Now, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides 200, 240, and 300. Let me denote this triangle as T with sides 200, 240, 300. Since the hexagon is equilateral, each side is the same length, let's call it 's'. The extensions of AB, CD, and EF form triangle T. I need to relate the side length 's' of the hexagon to the sides of triangle T.

I remember that in such configurations, especially with parallel sides, there might be similar triangles involved. Maybe the triangle T is similar to some triangle formed within the hexagon? Or perhaps the sides of T are related to the sides of the hexagon through some ratio due to the parallelism.

Let me recall that in a convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel, it's sometimes called a "zonogon". A zonogon can be tiled by parallelograms, and in such cases, the opposite sides are not only parallel but also equal in length. But here, the hexagon is equilateral, so all sides are equal, but the opposite sides are just parallel, not necessarily equal in length. Wait, no, in a zonogon, opposite sides are equal and parallel. But in this case, the hexagon is equilateral, so all sides are equal, so it must be a zonogon where opposite sides are equal and parallel. Therefore, in this case, opposite sides are equal and parallel, so AB = DE = s, BC = EF = s, CD = FA = s.

Given that, when we extend AB, CD, and EF, they form triangle T. Let me try to sketch this mentally. If I extend AB, CD, and EF, which are three non-adjacent sides, their extensions meet to form a triangle. Since the hexagon is convex, the extensions of these sides will meet at three points forming the triangle T.

Based on execution_1.1:
Let me think about how the sides of the triangle relate to the sides of the hexagon. Since AB, CD, and EF are opposite sides, their extensions will form the sides of triangle T. The key here might be to find the distances between the parallel sides, which, due to the parallelism and equal length of opposite sides, might form similar triangles or use the concept of homothety.

Alternatively, maybe coordinate geometry can help. Let me assign coordinates to the hexagon's vertices and try to express the triangle T in terms of these coordinates. But that might get complicated. Let me see if there's a more geometric approach.

Alternatively, I remember that in such a hexagon, the triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF is similar to the medial triangle of the hexagon. Wait, not sure. Maybe the triangle T is similar to the original hexagon's sides or something else.

Wait, perhaps using vectors or coordinate geometry. Let me set up a coordinate system. Let me place point A at the origin (0,0). Let me assume that side AB is along the x-axis, so point B is at (s,0). Since the hexagon is equilateral and convex, the next side BC will make some angle with AB. Let me denote the angle at each vertex as θ. Since all sides are equal and opposite sides are parallel, the angles between consecutive sides should be equal? Wait, no, in a general equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel, the angles can vary, but opposite angles are equal. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, if opposite sides are parallel, then consecutive angles must be supplementary? Let me recall that in a convex polygon with opposite sides parallel, the sum of consecutive angles is 180 degrees. Wait, no, that's for a parallelogram. Wait, in a hexagon, if opposite sides are parallel, then the angles between consecutive sides must satisfy certain conditions.

Wait, perhaps it's better to assign coordinates. Let me try to assign coordinates to the hexagon, assuming some symmetry.

Based on execution_2.1:
Let me place point A at (0,0), point B at (s,0). Since AB is parallel to DE, DE must also be a horizontal line if AB is horizontal. Let's assume that.

<prompt_3.1> Assign coordinates to the hexagon's vertices, starting with point A at the origin and side AB along the x-axis. Assume AB is horizontal and DE is parallel to AB. </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
Then, point D would be at some coordinate (x,0), but since DE is parallel to AB, DE is also horizontal. Wait, but DE is a side of the hexagon, so if AB is from (0,0) to (s,0), then DE must be from (a,b) to (a+s,b) for some (a,b). Hmm, but this might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe using vectors. Let me denote the sides as vectors.

Since the hexagon is equilateral, each side can be represented as a vector of length s. Let me denote the sides as vectors **AB**, **BC**, **CD**, **DE**, **EF**, **FA**. Since opposite sides are parallel, **AB** is parallel to **DE**, **BC** is parallel to **EF**, and **CD** is parallel to **FA**. Therefore, **AB** = k1 * **DE**, **BC** = k2 * **EF**, **CD** = k3 * **FA**, where k1, k2, k3 are scalars. But since the hexagon is equilateral, the lengths of all these vectors are equal to s. Therefore, the scalars k1, k2, k3 must be 1 or -1, depending on the direction. But since the hexagon is convex, the directions of the sides must be such that the turns between sides are all less than 180 degrees. Therefore, the vectors should be arranged in a way that each subsequent vector is a rotation from the previous one, maintaining convexity.

Alternatively, since opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon can be thought of as a centrally symmetric hexagon? Wait, no. In a centrally symmetric hexagon, opposite sides are not only parallel but also equal in length and opposite in direction. But here, the hexagon is equilateral, so all sides are equal, but opposite sides are parallel. Therefore, it's a special case of a zonogon. In a zonogon, opposite sides are equal and parallel, but here since it's equilateral, opposite sides are equal and parallel, so it's a zonogon. Therefore, the hexagon can be tiled by three parallelograms, each formed by two opposite sides. Hmm, but how does that help?

Alternatively, maybe using the concept of the triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF. Since these sides are non-adjacent and opposite, their extensions form a triangle. Let me think about the distances between the parallel sides. Since AB is parallel to DE, the distance between them is some height. Similarly, the distance between BC and EF, and between CD and FA. In a zonogon, these distances might be related to the side length and the angles between the sides.

Alternatively, maybe using the concept of similar triangles. If I can find the ratio of the sides of triangle T to the sides of the hexagon, then I can solve for s. Let me think about how the sides of triangle T relate to the sides of the hexagon.
</execution_3.1>
</Execution_3>

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
Suppose that triangle T has sides 200, 240, 300. Let's denote the sides as a, b, c, where a=200, b=240, c=300. The hexagon's side length is s. If I can find the ratio of a, b, c to s, then I can find s.

Alternatively, since the hexagon is equilateral, the triangle T might be similar to the triangle formed by connecting certain points in the hexagon. But I need to find a relation between s and the sides of T.

Let me consider the extensions of AB, CD, and EF. When we extend AB, CD, and EF, they form triangle T. Let me try to find the lengths of these extensions in terms of s.

<prompt_4.1> Think about how the sides of the triangle T relate to the hexagon's sides and the extensions of the sides. Consider the distances between the parallel sides and their relation to the triangle's side lengths. </prompt_4.1>

Based on execution_3.1:
Alternatively, maybe using the area. The area of triangle T can be related to the area of the hexagon. However, since the hexagon is equilateral and convex, its area can be calculated in terms of s and the angles between the sides. But this might get complicated.

Alternatively, using the concept of homothety. If the triangle T is a homothety of the hexagon, then the ratio of similarity can be found. But I need to confirm if such a homothety exists.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that in a convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel, the triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF is similar to the original hexagon's triangle or something else.

Wait, maybe using the concept of the triangle T being the image of the hexagon under some transformation. But perhaps this is overcomplicating.

Let me try to approach this step by step.

<prompt_4.2> Plan to approach the problem step-by-step, starting by considering the triangle T formed by the extensions of sides AB, CD, and EF and relating it to the hexagon's side length. </prompt_4.2>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
For example, the side AB is extended beyond B and A, and similarly for CD and EF. The intersection points of these extensions form the triangle T. The lengths of these extensions might relate to the side length s. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the sides of triangle T are proportional to the distances between the parallel sides of the hexagon. Since AB is parallel to DE, the distance between AB and DE is some value, say h1. Similarly, the distance between BC and EF is h2, and between CD and FA is h3. Then, the sides of triangle T might be related to these heights. But I need to find a relationship between h1, h2, h3 and the side length s.

Alternatively, perhaps using the law of cosines. If I can find the angles between the sides of triangle T, then relate them to the angles of the hexagon. But since the hexagon is equilateral and convex, the angles between the sides are related to the extensions.
</execution_4.1>

<execution_4.2>
First, let's consider the hexagon ABCDEF. Since it's equilateral and convex with opposite sides parallel, the sides AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA are all equal to s. Opposite sides AB || DE, BC || EF, CD || FA.

Now, when we extend AB, CD, and EF, they form triangle T. Let's denote the triangle T as having vertices X, Y, Z, where X is the intersection of the extensions of AB and CD, Y is the intersection of extensions of CD and EF, and Z is the intersection of extensions of EF and AB.

Wait, actually, depending on the order of the sides, the triangle might be formed differently. Let me confirm. The extensions of AB, CD, and EF. So each pair of these sides is extended until they meet, forming the triangle. So AB and CD are extended until they meet at a point, CD and EF extended until they meet at another point, and EF and AB extended until they meet at the third point. So the triangle T has vertices at these three intersection points.

Given that AB, CD, EF are sides of the hexagon, their extensions meet at points outside the hexagon, forming triangle T. Since the hexagon is convex, these extensions will indeed form a triangle outside the hexagon.

Given that, the sides of triangle T are 200, 240, 300. Let me denote the sides opposite to vertices X, Y, Z as a, b, c. But maybe it's better to assign specific labels. Let me denote the extensions:

- Extension of AB and CD meet at point X.
- Extension of CD and EF meet at point Y.
- Extension of EF and AB meet at point Z.

Therefore, triangle T is triangle XYZ with sides opposite to X, Y, Z being 200, 240, 300. Wait, but actually, the lengths of the sides of triangle T are the distances between the intersection points. So each side of triangle T is the distance between two intersection points. For example, side XY is the distance between X and Y, which is the intersection of extensions of CD and EF. Wait, no. Wait, if X is the intersection of AB and CD, Y is the intersection of CD and EF, Z is the intersection of EF and AB. Then, triangle XYZ would have sides XY, YZ, ZX. But the lengths of these sides are given as 200, 240, 300. So we need to relate these lengths to the side length s of the hexagon.

To find the relationship, let's consider the coordinates. Let me try to assign coordinates to the hexagon.

Let me place point A at (0,0). Let me assume that side AB is along the positive x-axis, so point B is at (s, 0). Since the hexagon is convex and equilateral, the next side BC will make some angle θ with AB. Let me denote the angle at each vertex as θ. However, since opposite sides are parallel, the angles at each vertex must satisfy certain conditions. For example, the angle between AB and BC is θ, then the angle between CD and DE must also be θ because CD is parallel to FA, and DE is parallel to AB. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, in a convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel, the angles between consecutive sides are equal in pairs. That is, the angles at A and D are equal, the angles at B and E are equal, and the angles at C and F are equal. Let me denote the angles at A, B, C as α, β, γ respectively. Then the angles at D, E, F are also α, β, γ.

Since the hexagon is convex, all internal angles are less than 180 degrees. Also, the sum of internal angles of a hexagon is (6-2)*180 = 720 degrees. Therefore, 3α + 3β + 3γ = 720, so α + β + γ = 240 degrees.

But how does this help? Maybe not directly. Let me try to find coordinates for the hexagon.

Let me start with point A at (0,0). AB is along the x-axis to (s,0). Let me assume that the angle at B is β, so the direction from B to C is at an angle of 180 - β degrees from the positive x-axis (since the internal angle is β, the external angle is 180 - β). Wait, no. Wait, the internal angle at B is β, so the external angle is 180 - β. The direction from B to C is determined by the external angle. Since the hexagon is convex, all external angles are less than 180 degrees.

Wait, perhaps using vectors. Let me denote each side as a vector. Let me denote the sides as vectors **AB**, **BC**, **CD**, **DE**, **EF**, **FA**, each of length s. Since AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA. Therefore, **AB** = **DE**, **BC** = **EF**, **CD** = **FA**. Wait, but in a hexagon, the sum of all vectors should be zero because it's a closed polygon. So **AB** + **BC** + **CD** + **DE** + **EF** + **FA** = 0.

But since **AB** = **DE**, **BC** = **EF**, **CD** = **FA**, we can write:

**AB** + **BC** + **CD** + **AB** + **BC** + **CD** = 0

Therefore, 2(**AB** + **BC** + **CD**) = 0 => **AB** + **BC** + **CD** = 0

So the sum of the first three vectors is zero. That means the triangle formed by vectors **AB**, **BC**, **CD** is a closed triangle. Therefore, the hexagon can be thought of as two congruent triangles (since **AB** + **BC** + **CD** = 0) connected by their corresponding sides.

Wait, this is interesting. So the first three sides form a triangle, and the last three sides form another triangle congruent to the first one. Therefore, the hexagon is composed of two congruent triangles connected by their corresponding sides. Therefore, the hexagon is symmetric in some way.

Given that, the triangle T formed by extending AB, CD, and EF is related to these triangles. Let me try to visualize this.

Since AB, CD, EF are sides of the hexagon, their extensions form triangle T. Let me think about the relation between triangle T and the hexagon.

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
Since the hexagon is made by two congruent triangles, the extensions of AB, CD, and EF might form a larger triangle that encompasses both congruent triangles. Let me try to see. The side AB is part of the first triangle, CD is the next side, EF is the last side. Extending AB, CD, EF would form a triangle outside the hexagon. The sides of this triangle would be related to the distances between the sides of the hexagon.

Alternatively, maybe using similar triangles. If I can find similar triangles within the hexagon and triangle T, then I can set up proportions between their sides.

Alternatively, since the hexagon is composed of two congruent triangles, the triangle T might be similar to these triangles, scaled by some factor. Let me explore this idea.

Suppose the original triangle (formed by **AB**, **BC**, **CD**) has sides of length s, s, s (since each vector is length s). Wait, but **AB** + **BC** + **CD** = 0, so the triangle formed by these vectors has sides equal to the vectors themselves, each of length s. Therefore, the triangle formed by connecting points A, B, C, D (since **AB** + **BC** + **CD** = 0, so D is the point such that AD is the vector sum of AB, BC, CD). Wait, no, actually, if **AB** + **BC** + **CD** = 0, then starting at A, moving along **AB** to B, then **BC** to C, then **CD** brings us back to A. Wait, that can't be, because **AB** + **BC** + **CD** = 0 implies that moving from A to B to C to D brings us back to A. Therefore, points A, B, C, D form a triangle? Wait, no. Wait, if **AB** + **BC** + **CD** = 0, then starting at A, moving along **AB** to B, then **BC** to C, then **CD** to D, and **DA** would be the remaining side. Wait, but since **DA** is equal to -(**AB** + **BC** + **CD**), which is zero. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me think again.

If **AB** + **BC** + **CD** = 0, then the vectors form a closed triangle. So starting at point A, moving along **AB** to B, then along **BC** to C, then along **CD** to D, and then along **DA** back to A. Wait, but **DA** would be the negative of the sum **AB** + **BC** + **CD**, which is zero. Therefore, **DA** is zero, which is impossible. Therefore, perhaps this approach is flawed.

Alternatively, maybe the hexagon is formed by two congruent triangles connected in some way. Let me think differently. Since the hexagon is equilateral and convex with opposite sides parallel, the hexagon can be thought of as a translation of a triangle. For example, if you take a triangle and translate it along a vector, you get a hexagon. Wait, but in this case, the hexagon is equilateral, so all sides are equal, but the translations would have to be such that the sides remain equal. This might relate to the concept of a zonogon, where the hexagon is a zonogon formed by the Minkowski sum of line segments in different directions.

But perhaps this is too abstract. Let me try to use coordinate geometry. Let me assign coordinates to the hexagon.

Let me place point A at (0,0). Let me assume that side AB is along the x-axis, so point B is at (s, 0). Since the hexagon is equilateral and convex, the next side BC will make some angle θ with AB. Let me denote the angle at B as θ, so the direction from B to C is at an angle θ from AB. Similarly, the angle at C is some angle, and so on. However, due to the opposite sides being parallel, the angles must satisfy certain conditions.

Wait, since AB is parallel to DE, the direction of AB is the same as DE. Similarly, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA. Therefore, the direction from B to C is the same as the direction from E to F. Similarly, the direction from C to D is the same as the direction from F to A.

Given that, let me denote the angles between consecutive sides. Let me denote the angle at vertex A as α, at B as β, at C as γ, at D as α, at E as β, at F as γ. Since the hexagon is convex, all these angles are less than 180 degrees. Also, the sum of internal angles is 720 degrees, so 2(α + β + γ) = 720 => α + β + γ = 360 degrees.

But how does this help in finding the side length s? Let me try to express the coordinates of the hexagon in terms of s and angles α, β, γ.

Starting with point A(0,0), AB is along the x-axis to point B(s, 0). The next side BC makes an angle β at point B. So the direction from B to C is β degrees above the x-axis. Therefore, the coordinates of point C can be expressed as:

C_x = s + s*cos(β)
C_y = 0 + s*sin(β)

Then, from point C, the side CD makes an angle γ at point C. The direction from C to D is γ degrees relative to the previous direction. Wait, since CD is parallel to FA, which is the side from F to A. Let me think. The direction from C to D should be the same as the direction from F to A. Let me denote the direction from F to A as some angle. Wait, this might get too complicated. Alternatively, since CD is parallel to FA, the vector **CD** is equal to the vector **FA**. Since **FA** is from F to A, which is (-**AF**). But since the hexagon is equilateral, **AF** has length s, so **CD** is a vector of length s in the same direction as **FA**.

Wait, maybe this approach is too involved. Let me try a different method.

</Execution_5>

<Plan_6>
Based on execution_5.1:
Let me consider that the triangle T formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF has sides 200, 240, 300. Let me denote the sides of triangle T as a, b, c, where a=200, b=240, c=300.

<prompt_6.1> Using the given side lengths of triangle T and the properties of the hexagon, consider how the side length s of the hexagon relates to the sides of triangle T and plan to use the law of cosines to find s. </prompt_6.1>
</Plan_6>

<Execution_6>
<execution_6.1>
Assuming that triangle T is similar to the hexagon's fundamental triangle (the one formed by vectors **AB**, **BC**, **CD**), then the ratio of sides would be the same. But since the hexagon is made by two such triangles, the sides of triangle T might be twice the sides of the original triangle. Wait, if each side of triangle T is formed by two sides of the hexagon, then perhaps the sides of T are twice the sides of the original triangle. But since the original triangle has sides of length s, then the sides of T would be 2s. However, the sides of T are 200, 240, 300, which are in the ratio 200:240:300 = 10:12:15. If these were twice the sides of the hexagon, then s would be 100, 120, 150, but these are different, so that can't be. Therefore, this approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the sides of triangle T are related to the distances between the parallel sides of the hexagon. For example, the distance between AB and DE is some value, and the sides of triangle T are proportional to these distances. Let me recall that in a trapezoid, the length of the line segment connecting the midpoints of the non-parallel sides is the average of the lengths of the two parallel sides. However, here we have a hexagon with multiple pairs of parallel sides, so maybe the distances between these sides can be related to the side length s.

Alternatively, let me consider that the triangle T is formed by the intersections of the extended sides AB, CD, and EF. Let me denote the intersection points as X (intersection of AB and CD), Y (intersection of CD and EF), and Z (intersection of EF and AB). Then triangle XYZ has sides of 200, 240, 300. Let me try to express the coordinates of points X, Y, Z in terms of s and angles, then compute the distances between them.

Let me start by assigning coordinates to the hexagon. Let me place point A at (0,0). Let me denote the direction from A to B as along the x-axis, so point B is at (s, 0). Let me denote the angle at B as θ, so the direction from B to C is θ degrees from the x-axis. Then, point C can be expressed as:

C_x = s + s*cosθ
C_y = 0 + s*sinθ

Next, the direction from C to D is determined by the angles at the vertices. Since the hexagon is convex and opposite sides are parallel, the angle at C must be such that the direction from C to D is parallel to the direction from F to A. Let me denote the direction from F to A as φ. Since FA is from F to A, which is from some point F to (0,0). Let me try to find coordinates for all points.

Alternatively, since this is getting too complicated, maybe using vector algebra. Let me denote the vectors **AB** = (s, 0), **BC** = (s*cosθ, s*sinθ), **CD** = (s*cosφ, s*sinφ), **DE** = (-s, 0), **EF** = (s*cosφ, -s*sinφ), **FA** = (-s*cosθ, -s*sinθ). Wait, since opposite sides are parallel and equal, **AB** = **DE**, **BC** = **EF**, **CD** = **FA**. Therefore, **AB** = (s, 0), so **DE** must also be (s, 0). Similarly, **BC** = (s*cosθ, s*sinθ), so **EF** = (s*cosθ, s*sinθ). **CD** = (s*cosφ, s*sinφ), so **FA** = (s*cosφ, s*sinφ). However, **FA** is the vector from F to A, which should be equal to **CD**. Wait, **CD** is the vector from C to D, and **FA** is the vector from F to A. For them to be equal, their magnitudes and directions must be the same. Therefore, **FA** = **CD**. But **FA** is from F to A, so its direction is from F to A, which is the reverse of **AF**. Therefore, **FA** = -**AF**. Therefore, **CD** = -**AF**. Since **AF** is equal to **BC**, which is (s*cosθ, s*sinθ), then **CD** = -**BC** = (-s*cosθ, -s*sinθ). Therefore, **CD** is (-s*cosθ, -s*sinθ). Therefore, the direction from C to D is (-cosθ, -sinθ). Therefore, the angle of **CD** is 180 + θ degrees from the positive x-axis.

Similarly, since **FA** = **CD**, which is (-s*cosθ, -s*sinθ), the direction from F to A is (-cosθ, -sinθ). Therefore, the angle at A is determined by the direction from F to A. Since FA is from F to A, which is direction (-cosθ, -sinθ). Therefore, the angle at A is 180 - θ degrees from the positive x-axis.

Given this, let me try to write the coordinates step by step.

Starting with point A(0,0).

Let me try to assign coordinates step by step.

<execution_7.1>
Let me denote the direction from A to B as along the x-axis, so **AB** = (s, 0). Point B is at (s, 0).

At point B, the direction from B to C is θ degrees from the x-axis. Therefore, the coordinates of point C are:

C_x = s + s*cosθ
C_y = 0 + s*sinθ

At point C, the direction from C to D is determined by the angle at C. Since **CD** is parallel to **FA**, which is from F to A. The direction of **FA** is (-cosθ, -sinθ), so **CD** must have the same direction. Therefore, the direction from C to D is (-cosθ, -sinθ). Therefore, the coordinates of D are:

D_x = C_x - s*cosθ = s + s*cosθ - s*cosθ = s
D_y = C_y - s*sinθ = s*sinθ - s*sinθ = 0

Wait, that can't be right. If D is at (s, 0), which is the same as point B. That would collapse the hexagon, which is impossible. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps the direction of **CD** is not (-cosθ, -sinθ), but rather the same as **FA**. Since **FA** is from F to A, which is (-cosθ, -sinθ), then **CD** must be equal to **FA**, so **CD** = (-cosθ, -sinθ). Therefore, the displacement from C to D is (-cosθ, -sinθ). Therefore, coordinates of D:

D_x = C_x - s*cosθ
D_y = C_y - s*sinθ

But point C is at (s + s*cosθ, s*sinθ). Therefore:

D_x = s + s*cosθ - s*cosθ = s
D_y = s*sinθ - s*sinθ = 0

Again, this leads to D being at (s, 0), which is the same as point B. That's impossible. Therefore, my assumption about the direction of **CD** must be incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the direction of **CD** is determined differently. Since **CD** is parallel to **FA**, which is from F to A. If **FA** is a vector from F to A, then **CD** is a vector from C to D that is equal in magnitude and direction to **FA**. Therefore, **CD** = **FA**. Therefore, the vector from C to D is equal to the vector from F to A. Let me denote point F as (f_x, f_y). Then **FA** = (0 - f_x, 0 - f_y) = (-f_x, -f_y). Therefore, **CD** = (-f_x, -f_y). Therefore, the displacement from C to D is (-f_x, -f_y). Therefore, coordinates of D:

D_x = C_x - f_x
D_y = C_y - f_y

But we need to express this in terms of s and angles. This is getting too tangled. Let me try a different approach.

Since the hexagon is equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon is a special case of a zonogon. In such a zonogon, the sides can be grouped into pairs of parallel sides, each pair separated by a certain distance. The hexagon can be seen as the Minkowski sum of three line segments in different directions. However, I might need a different approach.

Let me consider the triangle T formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. The sides of triangle T are 200, 240, 300. Let me denote these sides as a=200, b=240, c=300. Let me assume that these sides correspond to the extensions of AB, CD, and EF. Let me denote the intersection points of these extensions as X, Y, Z. So X is the intersection of AB and CD, Y is the intersection of CD and EF, and Z is the intersection of EF and AB.

Since AB, CD, EF are sides of the hexagon, their extensions form triangle XYZ. The key idea is that the distances between the parallel sides are related to the side length s of the hexagon. In a zonogon, the distances between parallel sides can be related to the side length and the angles between the sides.

<Execution_8>
<execution_8.1>
Let me denote the distance between AB and DE as h1, between BC and EF as h2, and between CD and FA as h3.

In a zonogon, the distance between two parallel sides can be calculated using the formula involving the side length and the sine of the angle between consecutive sides. For example, the distance between AB and DE (h1) can be expressed as h1 = s * sin(theta), where theta is the angle between AB and BC. Similarly, h2 = s * sin(phi), and h3 = s * sin(psi), where phi and psi are the angles between BC and CD, and CD and FA, respectively.

However, since the hexagon is equilateral and convex, the sum of the angles between consecutive sides should be 180 degrees. Wait, no. The sum of internal angles in a hexagon is 720 degrees, but in a zonogon, the angles between consecutive sides are related to the parallel sides.

Alternatively, in a zonogon, the distances between the parallel sides can be expressed in terms of the side length and the angles. For example, the distance between AB and DE is equal to the height of the parallelogram formed by AB and DE, which would be s * sin(theta), where theta is the angle between AB and the next side BC. Similarly, the distances h2 and h3 can be expressed as s * sin(phi) and s * sin(psi), where phi and psi are the angles between the respective sides.

Given that, the triangle T formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF has sides proportional to these distances h1, h2, h3. However, triangle T's sides are 200, 240, 300. So perhaps these are proportional to h1, h2, h3. However, since the triangle's sides are formed by the intersections of the extended sides, the actual lengths might be related to h1, h2, h3 through some trigonometric relationships.

Alternatively, using similar triangles. The triangle T is formed by the intersections of the extended sides, so each side of T is parallel to a side of the hexagon. Wait, no. The sides of T are formed by the extensions of the sides of the hexagon, so the sides of T are not necessarily parallel to the sides of the hexagon. Instead, the sides of T are formed by lines that are extensions of the sides of the hexagon.

But since the hexagon has opposite sides parallel, the extensions of AB and DE are parallel, the extensions of BC and EF are parallel, and the extensions of CD and FA are parallel. Therefore, triangle T is formed by three lines, each pair of which are parallel to a pair of sides of the hexagon. Therefore, triangle T is similar to the triangle formed by the three pairs of parallel lines. However, since the hexagon is equilateral, the distances between these parallel lines (h1, h2, h3) are related to the side length s and the angles between the sides.

Let me try to model this. Suppose the three pairs of parallel sides (AB-DE, BC-EF, CD-FA) are each separated by a distance h1, h2, h3 respectively. Then, the triangle T formed by the extensions of these sides would have sides proportional to these distances. However, the actual lengths of the sides of T would depend on the angles between the directions of the sides.

Alternatively, using the formula for the distance between two parallel lines. If AB and DE are two parallel lines, the distance between them is h1. Similarly, the distance between BC and EF is h2, and between CD and FA is h3. If we can find h1, h2, h3 in terms of s and the angles, then perhaps we can relate them to the sides of triangle T.

However, this approach might require more geometric insight. Let me consider the triangle T formed by the extensions. Each side of T is formed by the intersection of two extensions. For example, side XY of triangle T is formed by the intersection of extensions of AB and CD. The length of XY can be related to the distances h1 and h2 and the angle between the directions of AB and CD.

Since AB and CD are sides of the hexagon, and AB is parallel to DE, CD is parallel to FA. The angle between AB and CD would be equal to the angle between DE and FA. However, I need to find the relationship between the sides of triangle T and the distances h1, h2, h3.

Alternatively, using the concept of similar triangles. If I can find three similar triangles within the hexagon and triangle T, then I can set up proportions between their sides.

Let me try to think of the hexagon as a combination of three parallelograms, each formed by two pairs of opposite sides. Since the hexagon is convex and equilateral, each of these parallelograms would have sides equal to s and the distances between the parallel sides h1, h2, h3. The angles of these parallelograms would be the angles between the sides of the hexagon.

However, this is getting too abstract. Let me try to find a relationship between the side length s and the sides of triangle T. Given that the sides of T are 200, 240, 300, and the hexagon is equilateral and convex with opposite sides parallel, there must be a proportional relationship between s and these sides.

Perhaps the sides of triangle T are proportional to the side length s multiplied by some factor involving the angles of the hexagon. However, without knowing the angles, this approach is stuck.

Wait, maybe using the fact that the product of the sides of triangle T equals the product of the sides of the hexagon. But that seems arbitrary. Alternatively, since the hexagon is equilateral, the sides of triangle T might be related to the side length s through some geometric mean. For example, if the sides of T are 200, 240, 300, then perhaps s is the geometric mean, but 200*240*300 = 14,400,000, and the cube root is 24.49, which is not an integer, so that's unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the side length s is the arithmetic mean of the sides of T. (200 + 240 + 300)/3 = 840/3 = 280. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the side length s is related to the sides of triangle T through the formula s = (a*b*c)^(1/3), but 200*240*300 = 14,400,000, cube root is 24.49, which again is not an integer.

Wait, perhaps the sides of triangle T are twice the sides of the original triangle formed by the hexagon's sides. But the original triangle would have sides related to s and angles, which we don't know.

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that in a regular hexagon (which is not the case here), the triangle formed by the extensions of every other side is equilateral. However, in this problem, the hexagon is not regular, but equilateral and convex with opposite sides parallel. Therefore, the triangle T might have sides proportional to the distances between the parallel sides, which in turn depend on the side length s and the angles between the sides.

Let me recall that in a zonogon, the area is given by the product of the distances between the pairs of parallel sides and the sine of the angles between them. However, since we are dealing with a triangle formed by the intersections of these extended sides, maybe using trigonometric relationships.

Let me consider that the sides of triangle T are proportional to the distances between the parallel sides multiplied by some trigonometric function of the angles. For example, the length of a side of triangle T could be equal to the distance between two parallel sides divided by the sine of the angle between them. However, without knowing the angles, this approach is not helpful.

Alternatively, using the concept of intercept theorem (Thales' theorem). If two lines are intersected by parallel lines, the segments are proportional. However, in this case, the lines are extensions of the sides of the hexagon, which are not necessarily parallel to each other.

Wait, since AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA, the extensions of these sides are parallel. Therefore, the triangle T is formed by three lines, each pair of which are parallel to a pair of sides of the hexagon. Therefore, triangle T is similar to the triangle formed by the three pairs of parallel lines. However, since the hexagon is equilateral and convex, the triangle T might have sides that are scaled versions of the hexagon's fundamental triangle.

Wait, let me try to formalize this. Let me denote the hexagon's fundamental triangle as the triangle formed by vectors **AB**, **BC**, **CD**. Since **AB** + **BC** + **CD** = 0, as established earlier. Then, the triangle T is formed by the lines extending **AB**, **CD**, and **EF** (which is equal to **BC**). Therefore, the lines forming triangle T are:

- Line AB: direction **AB**
- Line CD: direction **CD**
- Line EF: direction **EF** = **BC**

Similarly, the other lines forming triangle T are:

- Line BC: direction **BC**
- Line EF: direction **BC**
- Line FA: direction **FA** = **CD**

Therefore, triangle T is formed by three lines, each pair of which are parallel to the sides of the hexagon. Specifically:

- Line AB is parallel to DE (which is **AB**)
- Line BC is parallel to EF (which is **BC**)
- Line CD is parallel to FA (which is **CD**)

Therefore, triangle T is formed by three lines, each pair of which are parallel to a pair of sides of the hexagon. Therefore, triangle T is similar to the triangle formed by the directions of the sides of the hexagon. However, since the hexagon is equilateral and convex, the triangle formed by the directions of the sides is a triangle with sides **AB**, **BC**, **CD**, which sum to zero, hence a degenerate triangle.

Wait, this seems contradictory. If the directions of the sides form a triangle that sums to zero, they must form a triangle themselves. However, if the vectors **AB**, **BC**, **CD** sum to zero, then they form a triangle. Therefore, the triangle formed by these vectors is actually the triangle connecting the points A, B, C, D, but since **AB** + **BC** + **CD** = 0, point D is back at A. Therefore, this is a closed triangle, but in reality, the hexagon is a six-sided figure, so this suggests that the triangle formed by **AB**, **BC**, **CD** is a closed triangle with sides AB, BC, CD, but since they sum to zero, it's a degenerate triangle.

This seems like a dead end. Let me try a different approach.

Let me consider that the triangle T has sides 200, 240, 300. Let me denote the sides opposite to these as a=200, b=240, c=300. Let me denote the angles opposite to these sides as α, β, γ. Then, by the Law of Cosines:

a² = b² + c² - 2bc cosα

But without knowing the angles, this doesn't help. However, since the hexagon is equilateral and convex, the angles between the sides are related to the side length s. If I can find the angles between the sides of the hexagon in terms of s, then I can relate them to the sides of triangle T.

Alternatively, using the fact that the hexagon is equilateral and convex, the angles between consecutive sides are supplementary to the angles of triangle T. Wait, perhaps not. Since the hexagon is formed by three pairs of parallel sides, the angles between the sides might relate to the angles of triangle T.

Alternatively, consider that the triangle T is formed by the intersections of the extended sides. Each side of triangle T is formed by the intersection of two extended sides of the hexagon. The length of each side of triangle T can be expressed in terms of the side length s and the angles between the sides of the hexagon. For example, the length of side XY (formed by the intersection of AB and CD) can be expressed using the law of sines or cosines based on the angles between AB and CD.

Let me attempt to model this. Suppose the angle between AB and CD is θ. Then, the length of side XY would be related to the distances between AB and CD and the angle θ. However, the distance between AB and CD is the height of the parallelogram formed by AB and CD, which is s * sinθ. If we can relate this height to the side length s and the angle θ, then perhaps we can express the length of XY in terms of s and θ. However, since we don't know θ, this approach is not helpful.

Alternatively, using the concept of similar triangles. If triangle T is formed by the intersections of the extended sides, and the hexagon has parallel sides, then the triangles formed by the intersections might be similar to the triangles within the hexagon. However, without knowing the exact configuration, this is challenging.

Wait, perhaps using the concept of intercept theorem. If two lines are intersected by parallel lines, the segments are proportional. However, in this case, the lines are not parallel, but the sides of the hexagon are parallel. Therefore, the intersections might form similar triangles.

Let me consider two adjacent sides of the hexagon, say AB and BC, which meet at vertex B. When extended, they form an external triangle. However, since the hexagon is convex, the external triangle would be outside the hexagon. However, triangle T is formed by extending AB, CD, and EF, which are three non-adjacent sides. The intersections of these extensions form triangle T.

Given that, perhaps triangle T is similar to the triangle formed by the extensions of AB, BC, and CD, but scaled by some factor. However, I need a more concrete relationship.

Alternatively, consider that the sides of triangle T are proportional to the distances between the parallel sides of the hexagon. For example, the length of side XY (formed by the intersection of AB and CD) is proportional to the distance between AB and CD divided by the sine of the angle between AB and CD. Similarly for the other sides. If this is the case, then:

XY = (distance between AB and DE) / sinθ

YZ = (distance between BC and EF) / sinφ

ZX = (distance between CD and FA) / sinψ

Where θ, φ, ψ are the angles between the respective sides.

However, since the hexagon is equilateral and convex, the angles θ, φ, ψ are related to the internal angles of the hexagon. For example, the angle between AB and CD is equal to the internal angle at vertex C. However, without knowing the internal angles, this approach is not helpful.

Wait, but the internal angles of the hexagon are related to the side length s and the side lengths of triangle T. Let me recall that in a convex polygon, the sum of the internal angles is (n-2)*180 degrees. For a hexagon, this is 720 degrees. However, without knowing the individual angles, we cannot proceed.

Perhaps using the concept of reciprocal vectors. In a zonogon, the area can be calculated as the product of the lengths of three non-coplanar vectors. However, in this case, since it's a hexagon in 2D, the area might be related to the cross products of the vectors. However, this seems too abstract.

Let me try to think of a simpler case. Suppose the hexagon is regular, but scaled. However, the problem states it's not regular, so that approach is invalid.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that in a zonogon, the sides can be grouped into three pairs of parallel sides, each pair separated by a distance. The triangle T formed by the extensions of these sides would have sides proportional to these distances. If the distances between the pairs of parallel sides are h1, h2, h3, then the sides of triangle T would be proportional to h1, h2, h3. However, the problem states that the sides of triangle T are 200, 240, 300. Therefore, if we can find h1, h2, h3 in terms of s, then we can set up equations to solve for s.

However, how to find h1, h2, h3 in terms of s? Let's consider that the distance between two parallel sides of a zonogon can be calculated using the formula h = s * sin(α), where α is the angle between the side and the direction perpendicular to the parallel sides. However, without knowing the angles, this is not helpful.

Alternatively, considering that in a zonogon, the area can be calculated as the sum of the areas of the parallelograms formed by each pair of parallel sides. However, since the hexagon is a zonogon, its area is equal to the sum of the areas of three parallelograms, each formed by a pair of opposite sides. The area of each parallelogram is base * height. The base is s, and the height is the distance between the parallel sides. Therefore, the total area of the hexagon is s*h1 + s*h2 + s*h3 = s*(h1 + h2 + h3). However, without knowing the area of the hexagon, this doesn't help.

Alternatively, since the hexagon is equilateral and convex, the distances h1, h2, h3 can be related to the side length s and the angles between the sides. For example, the distance between AB and DE (h1) can be expressed as s * sin(theta), where theta is the angle between AB and the direction perpendicular to AB. Similarly for h2 and h3. However, without knowing the angles, this approach is stuck.

Let me take a step back and think about the problem again. The key is that the triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF has sides 200, 240, 300. The hexagon is equilateral, convex, and opposite sides are parallel. Therefore, the triangle T is similar to the triangle formed by the three pairs of parallel sides. However, this is vague.

Wait, here's a breakthrough idea. Since the hexagon is equilateral and convex with opposite sides parallel, the triangle T is similar to the triangle formed by the three pairs of parallel sides. The sides of triangle T are 200, 240, 300, which are in the ratio 200:240:300 = 5:6:7.5. However, the triangle formed by the three pairs of parallel sides would have sides proportional to the distances between the parallel sides, which are related to the side length s. Therefore, if the sides of triangle T are in the ratio 5:6:7.5, then the distances between the parallel sides (h1, h2, h3) should also be in the same ratio, scaled by some factor related to s.

Therefore, h1 : h2 : h3 = 5 : 6 : 7.5. Let me verify this. If the sides of triangle T are proportional to the distances between the parallel sides, then the distances h1, h2, h3 must be proportional to the sides of triangle T. Therefore, h1 = 5k, h2 = 6k, h3 = 7.5k for some scaling factor k.

But how is k related to the side length s of the hexagon? Let's think about the relationship between the distance between two parallel sides and the side length s. For example, in a parallelogram, the distance between two parallel sides is equal to the height, which is equal to the side length multiplied by the sine of the angle between the sides. However, in this case, the hexagon is more complex.

Alternatively, consider that the distance between AB and DE is h1, and since AB and DE are parallel, and the hexagon is equilateral, the distance h1 can be expressed in terms of s and the angle theta between AB and the next side. If theta is the internal angle at vertex B, then h1 = s * sin(theta). Similarly, h2 = s * sin(phi), h3 = s * sin(psi), where phi and psi are the angles at vertices C and F, respectively.

However, since the sum of internal angles in the hexagon is 720 degrees, and the hexagon is equilateral, the sum of the angles theta + phi + psi + ... = 720 degrees. Wait, but we have three angles: at B, C, and F. However, there are six angles in a hexagon. Wait, no. The sum of internal angles in a hexagon is 720 degrees. If the hexagon is equilateral, the angles can vary but must sum to 720 degrees. However, without knowing the individual angles, this approach is stuck.

Wait, but in the zonogon, the sum of the angles around the center is 360 degrees. However, this is getting too abstract.

Let me try to think of a specific example. Suppose the hexagon is such that the distances h1, h2, h3 between the parallel sides are 200, 240, 300. Then, the side length s would be related to these distances. However, the problem states that the triangle formed by the extensions has sides 200, 240, 300. Therefore, the distances between the parallel sides are 200, 240, 300. Therefore, the side length s is related to these distances. However, how?

Wait, if the distance between AB and DE is 200, then s * sin(theta) = 200. Similarly, s * sin(phi) = 240, and s * sin(psi) = 300. Then, we have:

sin(theta) = 200/s

sin(phi) = 240/s

sin(psi) = 300/s

But since the hexagon is convex, all angles theta, phi, psi are less than 180 degrees, so their sines are positive. Also, in a zonogon, the sum of the angles around the center is 360 degrees. However, the angles theta, phi, psi are the angles between consecutive sides, which sum to 720 degrees for the hexagon.

But this is getting too vague. Let me consider that in a zonogon, the angles between the directions of the sides are related to the angles of the fundamental triangle. For example, if the fundamental triangle has angles alpha, beta, gamma, then the angles between the sides of the hexagon are alpha, beta, gamma, alpha, beta, gamma. However, in a hexagon, the internal angles are related to these.

However, this approach might not lead to a solution.

Let me try to make an assumption. Suppose that the triangle T with sides 200, 240, 300 is similar to the triangle formed by the vectors **AB**, **BC**, **CD**. Then, the side length s of the hexagon would be the length of each side of the hexagon, which is equal to the sides of the triangle T divided by the sine of the angles between the sides.

However, since the triangle T has sides 200, 240, 300, and the hexagon's sides are all length s, the relationship might be that s = 200 / sin(theta) = 240 / sin(phi) = 300 / sin(psi). But this would require that sin(theta) = 200/s, sin(phi) = 240/s, sin(psi) = 300/s. However, since the angles theta, phi, psi are related to the internal angles of the hexagon, which sum to 720 degrees, this might not hold.

Alternatively, using the fact that in a zonogon, the sum of the squares of the sides is equal to the sum of the squares of the diagonals. However, this is a property of parallelograms, not necessarily of zonogons.

Alternatively, using the fact that the radius of the circle circumscribed around the hexagon is related to the side length and the angles. However, without knowing the angles, this is not helpful.

Given that I'm stuck, let me consider that the side length s of the hexagon is the harmonic mean of 200, 240, and 300. The harmonic mean of three numbers a, b, c is 3/(1/a + 1/b + 1/c). Let's compute that:

Harmonic mean = 3 / (1/200 + 1/240 + 1/300) = 3 / (0.005 + 0.0041666667 + 0.0033333333) = 3 / 0.0125 = 24. But 24 is too small, and the triangle sides are 200, 240, 300, so this can't be the case.

Alternatively, maybe the side length s is the arithmetic mean of 200, 240, 300, which is (200 + 240 + 300)/3 = 740/3 ≈ 246.666... But this is speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the side length s is equal to the side of the triangle T. However, the triangle T has sides 200, 240, 300, so this is also speculative.

Wait, perhaps the triangle T is similar to the triangle formed by the three pairs of parallel sides. If the triangle T is similar to the triangle formed by the three pairs of parallel sides, then the ratio of similarity would be s / (200, 240, 300). However, without knowing the angles, this is not helpful.

Alternatively, if the triangle T is the fundamental triangle, then the side length s is equal to the side length of the triangle T. However, the triangle T has sides 200, 240, 300, which are not equal, so this is not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the side length s is the side of a regular hexagon that can be inscribed in the triangle T. However, this is too vague.

Given that I'm stuck, let me try to think of the problem in terms of similar triangles. If I can find three similar triangles inside the hexagon whose sides are proportional to 200, 240, 300, and relate them to the side length s.

Let me consider that the triangle T is formed by the intersections of the extended sides. Each side of triangle T is formed by the intersection of two extended sides of the hexagon. The length of each side of triangle T can be expressed as a function of the side length s and the angles between the sides of the hexagon. However, without knowing the angles, this is not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps using the concept of similar triangles in the hexagon. For example, the intersection points of the extended sides form similar triangles with the original hexagon. However, without knowing the exact configuration, this is difficult.

Given that I'm stuck, I think the key insight is that the hexagon can be viewed as a zonogon, and the triangle T is similar to the triangle formed by the three pairs of parallel sides. The sides of triangle T are proportional to the distances between the parallel sides, which are related to the side length s and the angles. Therefore, the side length s can be found by relating the sides of triangle T to the side length s.

However, without knowing the angles, this is difficult. But wait, if the hexagon is equilateral and convex, the sum of the internal angles is 720 degrees. If the triangle T has sides 200, 240, 300, which are in the ratio 5:6:7.5, then perhaps the side length s is related to the harmonic mean or some other mean of these numbers. However, I need to find a relationship.

Alternatively, using the fact that in a zonogon, the sides can be grouped into three pairs of equal length. However, in this problem, the hexagon has all sides equal, but the pairs of opposite sides are parallel. Therefore, the side length s is the same for all sides, but the angles between consecutive sides can vary. However, the triangle T formed by the extensions has sides 200, 240, 300.

Given that, perhaps the side length s is the same for all sides, and the triangle T is formed by the intersections of the extended sides, which are each offset by some multiple of s. However, this is vague.

Alternatively, consider that the triangle T is the image of the hexagon under a homothety (scaling) transformation. However, without knowing the center or scale factor, this is not helpful.

Given that I'm stuck, I think the answer is likely 240, but I need to verify.

Wait, if the triangle T has sides 200, 240, 300, which are in the ratio 5:6:7.5. If the side length s is the harmonic mean or arithmetic mean, but given the problem's nature, perhaps s is 240. However, I need to find a better reasoning.

Alternatively, using the fact that in a zonogon, the area of the triangle formed by the extensions is equal to the product of the side length and the sum of the distances between the parallel sides. However, this is speculative.

Alternatively, using the fact that the triangle T is the fundamental triangle of the zonogon, and the side length s is equal to the minimal distance between the parallel sides. However, without knowing the angles, this is not helpful.

Given that I'm stuck, I think the answer is 240, but I need to verify.

Alternatively, using the formula for the radius of a circumscribed circle around a triangle. If the triangle T is the fundamental triangle, then the circumradius R = (a*b*c)/(4*Area). However, without knowing the angles, this is not helpful.

Given that I'm stuck, I think the answer is \boxed{240}.
