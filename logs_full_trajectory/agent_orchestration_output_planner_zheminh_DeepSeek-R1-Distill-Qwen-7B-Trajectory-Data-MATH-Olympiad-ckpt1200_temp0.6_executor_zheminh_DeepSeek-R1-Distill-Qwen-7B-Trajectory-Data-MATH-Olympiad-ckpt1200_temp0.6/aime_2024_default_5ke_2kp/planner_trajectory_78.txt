<Plan_1>
Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly.

We have three points: O at the origin (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, √3/2). The family of segments F consists of all unit length segments PQ in the first quadrant where P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis. So each segment PQ has length 1, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. The segment AB is given, which connects A to B. The problem states that there's a unique point C on AB (other than A or B) that doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB itself. We need to find OC², which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C, and express it as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, then find p+q.

Alright, so first, let me visualize this setup.

<prompt_1.1> Visualize the coordinate plane with points O, A, and B, and describe the family of segments F. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
We have the origin, point A halfway along the x-axis, and point B at a third of the way up the y-axis. The segment AB connects them. The family F consists of all unit segments from the x-axis to the y-axis. So each PQ in F has length 1, P on x-axis, Q on y-axis. So P can vary along the x-axis, Q accordingly along the y-axis such that PQ is length 1. So the set of all such PQ segments forms a family of line segments in the first quadrant, each of unit length, starting from the x-axis and ending on the y-axis.

Now, the problem says that there's a unique point C on AB (not A or B) that isn't on any other segment from F except AB. So AB is one such segment, and C is another point on AB such that no other segment from F passes through C. Our job is to find that point C and compute OC².

First, let's parametrize the segment AB. Since A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, √3/2), the parametric equations for AB can be written as:
x = (1/2)(1 - t)
y = (√3/2)t
for t from 0 to 1. So when t=0, we are at A, and when t=1, we are at B.

So any point C on AB can be written as ((1/2)(1 - t), (√3/2)t) for some t between 0 and 1. We need to find the value of t such that the point C is not on any other segment PQ from the family F, except AB.

So, to rephrase, we need to find a point C on AB such that there does not exist any other segment PQ (with P on x-axis and Q on y-axis, PQ length 1) that passes through C. Except for AB itself.
</execution_1.1>
</Execution_1>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
First, let's understand the family F. Each segment PQ in F is a line segment from (p, 0) to (0, q) with the constraint that the distance between (p, 0) and (0, q) is 1. So, using the distance formula:

<prompt_2.1> Derive the equation for segments in the family F using the distance formula. </prompt_2.1>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
√(p² + q²) = 1 ⇒ p² + q² = 1.

Therefore, for each p in [0,1], there's a corresponding q = √(1 - p²), and vice versa. So the segments in F can be parametrized by p (or q) such that each segment connects (p, 0) to (0, √(1 - p²)).

Alternatively, we can parametrize each segment by an angle θ, where the segment makes an angle θ with the x-axis. Then, the slope of the segment PQ would be -tan θ (since it goes from (p,0) to (0,q)), so the slope is (q - 0)/(0 - p) = -q/p = -tan θ. Therefore, tan θ = q/p. Since p² + q² = 1, we can write p = cos θ and q = sin θ for θ in [0, π/2]. So each segment PQ can be parametrized by θ, where P is (cos θ, 0) and Q is (0, sin θ). Therefore, the equation of segment PQ can be written as x / cos θ + y / sin θ = 1, which is the intercept form of the line equation.
</execution_2.1>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
So, any point (x, y) on PQ satisfies x / cos θ + y / sin θ = 1, and since PQ has length 1, cos² θ + sin² θ = 1, which is satisfied by the parametrization.

Therefore, the equation of the line containing PQ is x / cos θ + y / sin θ = 1.

Now, we need to find a point C on AB that is not on any other line x / cos θ + y / sin θ = 1 except for the line corresponding to θ where AB is located.

First, let's find the equation of AB.

<prompt_3.1> Find the equation of the line AB. </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
Points A (1/2, 0) and B (0, √3/2). The slope of AB is (√3/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = -√3. Therefore, the equation of AB is y = -√3 x + √3/2.

Alternatively, in intercept form, it's x/(1/2) + y/(√3/2) = 1, which simplifies to 2x + (2y)/√3 = 1 ⇒ 2x + (2/√3)y = 1.
</execution_3.1>
</Execution_3>

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
But maybe we can use the parametric equations for AB as we did earlier.

Now, we need to find a point C = ( (1/2)(1 - t), (√3/2)t ) on AB such that there is no θ ≠ θ_AB (where θ_AB is the angle corresponding to AB) for which the point C lies on the line x / cos θ + y / sin θ = 1.

So, for the point C to lie on the line x / cos θ + y / sin θ = 1, we can substitute the coordinates of C into the equation:

<prompt_4.1> Set up the equation for the line containing PQ and substitute the coordinates of C. </prompt_4.1>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
[ ( (1/2)(1 - t) ) / cos θ ] + [ ( (√3/2)t ) / sin θ ] = 1

We need this equation to have no solution θ except for the specific θ that corresponds to AB. So, we need to find t such that this equation has exactly one solution θ (which is θ_AB), and for all other θ, the equation does not hold. Wait, but the problem states that there's a unique point C on AB that does not belong to any other segment from F other than AB. So, for this point C, the equation above would have no solution for θ ≠ θ_AB. Therefore, the equation must have exactly one solution, which is θ_AB. Wait, but if we can find t such that the equation has no solutions except θ_AB, then that would mean that C is only on AB and no other segment in F.

Alternatively, perhaps we need to consider that for the point C, the equation x / cos θ + y / sin θ = 1 has only one solution θ (which is θ_AB), but for other θ, the line x / cos θ + y / sin θ = 1 does not pass through C. Hmm, maybe another approach is needed.

Alternatively, for each point C on AB, we can check if there exists another segment PQ in F (other than AB) that passes through C. If such a segment exists, then C is not the point we want. If no such segment exists, then C is the desired point.

So, the problem reduces to finding a point C on AB such that the line AB is the only segment in F passing through C. Therefore, for all other θ ≠ θ_AB, the line x / cos θ + y / sin θ = 1 does not pass through C.
</execution_4.1>
</Execution_4>

<Plan_5>
Based on execution_4.1:
Alternatively, perhaps we can parametrize the equation for θ and find t such that the equation has only one solution θ (which is θ_AB). Wait, but if we have a point C on AB, then substituting into the line equation for PQ gives a condition on θ. For each C, there might be one θ that satisfies the equation, which would correspond to the segment PQ passing through C. So, if for a particular C, there is only one θ (which is θ_AB) that satisfies the equation, then C is only on AB and no other PQ in F. But if for some C, there are two θs that satisfy the equation, then C is on two different segments PQ and AB, so such a C would be excluded. Therefore, we need to find a C on AB such that the equation has exactly one solution θ (which is θ_AB). Therefore, the discriminant of the equation in θ would be zero, leading to a unique solution.

Alternatively, perhaps we can set up the equation and find t such that the equation has only one solution θ. Let me try that.

So, substituting C into the line equation:

<prompt_5.1> Set up the equation for the line containing PQ and solve for θ in terms of t. </prompt_5.1>
</Plan_5>

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
[ ( (1/2)(1 - t) ) / cos θ ] + [ ( (√3/2)t ) / sin θ ] = 1

Let me denote this as:

( (1 - t)/2 ) / cos θ + ( ( √3 t ) / 2 ) / sin θ = 1

Multiply both sides by 2:

(1 - t)/cos θ + (√3 t)/sin θ = 2

Let me denote this equation as:

(1 - t)/cos θ + (√3 t)/sin θ = 2

We can write this as:

(1 - t) sec θ + √3 t csc θ = 2

Let me denote x = θ. Then, the equation becomes:

(1 - t) sec x + √3 t csc x = 2

We can write sec x = 1/cos x and csc x = 1/sin x. So,

(1 - t)/cos x + (√3 t)/sin x = 2

Let me try to express this in terms of sin x and cos x. Let me denote s = sin x, c = cos x. Then, s² + c² = 1.

So the equation becomes:

(1 - t)/c + (√3 t)/s = 2

Multiply both sides by c s:

(1 - t) s + √3 t c = 2 c s

So:

(1 - t) s + √3 t c = 2 c s

Let me rearrange terms:

(1 - t) s - 2 c s + √3 t c = 0

Factor out s from the first two terms:

s [ (1 - t) - 2 c ] + √3 t c = 0

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, let's write the equation as:

(1 - t) s + √3 t c = 2 c s

Let's rearrange:

(1 - t) s - 2 c s + √3 t c = 0

s [ (1 - t) - 2 c ] + √3 t c = 0

But since s² + c² = 1, perhaps we can express s in terms of c or vice versa. Let me try to express s from this equation.

From the equation:

(1 - t) s + √3 t c = 2 c s

Bring all terms to one side:

(1 - t) s + √3 t c - 2 c s = 0

Factor terms with s and c:

s [ (1 - t) - 2 c ] + c [ √3 t ] = 0

So:

s (1 - t - 2 c) + c √3 t = 0

We can write this as:

s (1 - t - 2 c) = - c √3 t

Then, divide both sides by c (assuming c ≠ 0):

s ( (1 - t - 2 c)/c ) = - √3 t

But s = √(1 - c²), so:

√(1 - c²) * (1 - t - 2 c)/c = - √3 t

This seems complicated. Maybe square both sides to eliminate the square root, but that might introduce extraneous solutions. Let me try:

[ √(1 - c²) * (1 - t - 2 c)/c ]² = [ - √3 t ]²

So:

(1 - c²) * (1 - t - 2 c)² / c² = 3 t²

Multiply both sides by c²:

(1 - c²)(1 - t - 2 c)² = 3 t² c²

This is a quartic equation in c. Solving this seems quite involved. Maybe there's a better approach.

Alternatively, let's consider that for the point C to lie on the segment PQ, it must lie between P and Q. Since PQ is a unit length segment from (p, 0) to (0, q) with p² + q² = 1, the coordinates of C must satisfy 0 ≤ x ≤ p and 0 ≤ y ≤ q. But since C is on AB, which goes from (1/2, 0) to (0, √3/2), the coordinates are (x, y) where x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0, and 2x + (2/√3)y ≤ 1.

But maybe that's not directly helpful. Let's think differently.

Suppose we parametrize the line AB with parameter t as before: C(t) = ( (1/2)(1 - t), (√3/2)t ). Now, for each t, we can check if there exists a θ ≠ θ_AB such that C(t) lies on the line x / cos θ + y / sin θ = 1.

If such a θ exists, then C(t) is on another segment PQ in F, which we need to exclude. We need to find t such that no such θ exists. Therefore, the equation:

( (1/2)(1 - t) ) / cos θ + ( (√3/2)t ) / sin θ = 1

has no solution θ ≠ θ_AB.

Alternatively, if we can show that for this particular t, the equation has exactly one solution θ (which is θ_AB), then C(t) is only on AB and no other PQ in F.

But how do we find such a t? Maybe by finding t such that the equation has a double root, i.e., discriminant zero? Let's try.

Let me consider the equation:

(1 - t)/cos θ + (√3 t)/sin θ = 2

Let me denote u = tan θ = sin θ / cos θ. Then, sin θ = u cos θ, and since sin² θ + cos² θ = 1, we have u² cos² θ + cos² θ = 1 ⇒ cos² θ (1 + u²) = 1 ⇒ cos θ = 1 / √(1 + u²), sin θ = u / √(1 + u²).

Substituting into the equation:

(1 - t) * √(1 + u²) + (√3 t) * (1 / √(1 + u²)) = 2

Multiply both sides by √(1 + u²):

(1 - t)(1 + u²) + √3 t = 2 √(1 + u²)

Let me denote v = √(1 + u²). Then, v ≥ 1, and u = √(v² - 1). The equation becomes:

(1 - t)(1 + (v² - 1)) + √3 t = 2 v

Simplify:

(1 - t)(v²) + √3 t = 2 v

So:

(1 - t) v² - 2 v + √3 t = 0

This is a quadratic equation in v:

(1 - t) v² - 2 v + √3 t = 0

We can write this as:

[(1 - t)] v² - [2] v + [√3 t] = 0

For this quadratic equation to have a unique solution v, the discriminant must be zero.

The discriminant D is:

D = [ -2 ]² - 4 * (1 - t) * (√3 t ) = 4 - 4 (1 - t)(√3 t )

Set D = 0:

4 - 4 √3 t (1 - t) = 0

Divide both sides by 4:

1 - √3 t (1 - t) = 0

So:

√3 t (1 - t) = 1

Thus:

√3 t - √3 t² = 1

Rearranged:

√3 t² - √3 t + 1 = 0

Wait, no. Let's do it step by step.

From:

√3 t (1 - t) = 1

So:

√3 t - √3 t² = 1

Bring all terms to left:

√3 t² - √3 t + 1 = 0

Wait, no:

√3 t (1 - t) = 1

Expand left side:

√3 t - √3 t² = 1

Bring 1 to left:

√3 t - √3 t² - 1 = 0

Multiply both sides by -1:

√3 t² - √3 t + 1 = 0

Wait, no:

Wait, original equation after moving 1 to left:

√3 t - √3 t² - 1 = 0

Which can be written as:

-√3 t² + √3 t - 1 = 0

Multiply both sides by -1:

√3 t² - √3 t + 1 = 0

Wait, but this quadratic equation in t is:

√3 t² - √3 t + 1 = 0

Let's compute discriminant D':

D' = ( -√3 )² - 4 * √3 * 1 = 3 - 4√3

Which is negative since 4√3 ≈ 6.928, so 3 - 6.928 ≈ -3.928 < 0. Therefore, no real solutions. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, that suggests that there's no real t for which the quadratic in v has a double root, which would mean that there's no point C on AB such that the equation has a unique solution v (i.e., unique θ). Therefore, perhaps my approach is flawed.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in substitution. Let me check the substitution steps again.

Starting from:

(1 - t)/cos θ + (√3 t)/sin θ = 2

Let u = tan θ = sin θ / cos θ. Then sin θ = u cos θ. Then, since sin² θ + cos² θ = 1, we have u² cos² θ + cos² θ = 1 ⇒ cos² θ (1 + u²) = 1 ⇒ cos θ = 1/√(1 + u²), sin θ = u / √(1 + u²). Correct.

Substituting into the equation:

(1 - t)/cos θ + (√3 t)/sin θ = (1 - t) * √(1 + u²) + (√3 t) * (1 / √(1 + u²)) = 2

Multiply both sides by √(1 + u²):

(1 - t)(1 + u²) + √3 t = 2 √(1 + u²)

Let v = √(1 + u²), so v ≥ 1. Then, 1 + u² = v², so u² = v² - 1. Then, the equation becomes:

(1 - t)(v²) + √3 t = 2 v

Which is:

(1 - t) v² - 2 v + √3 t = 0

Yes, that's correct. Then, treating this as a quadratic in v:

[(1 - t)] v² - [2] v + [√3 t] = 0

Discriminant D = (-2)^2 - 4*(1 - t)*(√3 t) = 4 - 4√3 t (1 - t). Setting D = 0 gives:

4 - 4√3 t (1 - t) = 0 ⇒ √3 t (1 - t) = 1 ⇒ √3 t - √3 t² = 1 ⇒ √3 t² - √3 t + 1 = 0

But discriminant D' = (-√3)^2 - 4*√3*1 = 3 - 4√3 ≈ 3 - 6.928 ≈ -3.928 < 0. So no real solutions. Therefore, there is no real t such that the quadratic in v has a double root. Thus, this approach suggests that there is no such point C on AB where the equation has a unique solution θ. But the problem states that there is such a point C. Therefore, my approach must be incorrect.

Hmm, maybe I need to think differently. Let's consider that for the point C to lie on a segment PQ from F (other than AB), there must exist some θ ≠ θ_AB such that C lies on the line x / cos θ + y / sin θ = 1. Therefore, the equation (1 - t)/cos θ + (√3 t)/sin θ = 2 must have a solution θ ≠ θ_AB. Therefore, if for a particular t, this equation has no solution θ, then C(t) is the desired point. Alternatively, if for some t, the equation has exactly one solution θ, which is θ_AB, then C(t) is only on AB and no other PQ. But how to ensure that?

Alternatively, perhaps we can parametrize θ and find t such that the equation has only θ_AB as solution. Let's think geometrically. The point C must lie on AB such that it is not on any other PQ segment. Therefore, the line AB is tangent to the envelope of all PQ segments. Wait, that might be a good approach.

The envelope of a family of lines is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. If AB is tangent to the envelope of F, then there is exactly one point on AB (the point of tangency) that lies on only one segment PQ (the tangent point), which would be the point C we are looking for. Therefore, we need to find the envelope of the family F and find its intersection with AB. The point of tangency would be the point C.

So, let's try this approach.

First, find the envelope of the family of lines x / cos θ + y / sin θ = 1 for θ in [0, π/2]. The envelope of such a family can be found by solving the system:

F(x, y, θ) = x / cos θ + y / sin θ - 1 = 0

and

dF/dθ = x sin θ / cos² θ - y cos θ / sin² θ = 0

So, the envelope is found by solving these two equations simultaneously.

Let's write the two equations:

1. x sec θ + y csc θ = 1

2. x sin θ / cos² θ - y cos θ / sin² θ = 0

Let me denote equation 2 as:

x sin θ / cos² θ = y cos θ / sin² θ

Multiply both sides by cos² θ sin² θ to eliminate denominators:

x sin³ θ = y cos³ θ

Therefore:

x / y = (cos³ θ) / (sin³ θ) = (cot θ)^3

So, x = y (cot θ)^3

Now, from equation 1:

x sec θ + y csc θ = 1

Substitute x = y (cot θ)^3:

y (cot θ)^3 sec θ + y csc θ = 1

Factor out y:

y [ (cot θ)^3 sec θ + csc θ ] = 1

Express in terms of sin and cos:

cot θ = cos θ / sin θ, sec θ = 1 / cos θ, csc θ = 1 / sin θ

So:

y [ ( (cos θ / sin θ)^3 ) * (1 / cos θ ) + (1 / sin θ ) ] = 1

Simplify the first term inside the brackets:

(cos³ θ / sin³ θ) * (1 / cos θ) = cos² θ / sin³ θ

Therefore:

y [ cos² θ / sin³ θ + 1 / sin θ ] = 1

Factor out 1 / sin θ:

y [ (cos² θ + sin² θ) / sin³ θ ] = y [ 1 / sin³ θ ] = 1

Therefore:

y = sin³ θ

But from equation 1, x = y (cot θ)^3 = sin³ θ * (cos³ θ / sin³ θ ) = cos³ θ

Therefore, the parametric equations for the envelope are:

x = cos³ θ

y = sin³ θ

This is the standard parametrization of an astroid. The envelope of the family F is an astroid given by x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.

Wait, let me verify:

If x = cos³ θ and y = sin³ θ, then x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = cos² θ + sin² θ = 1. Yes, so the envelope is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.

Therefore, the envelope of the family F is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1. Thus, the point C must lie on both AB and this astroid. Therefore, the intersection points of AB with the astroid are the points where AB is tangent to the astroid (since the envelope is tangent to each member of the family F). Therefore, the point C we are looking for is the intersection of AB with the astroid, and since the envelope is tangent to AB at that point, there is only one segment PQ (the tangent point) passing through C, which is AB itself. Wait, but AB is a segment in F. Therefore, the point C is the point where AB is tangent to the astroid, so the only segment from F passing through C is AB. Therefore, this point C is the unique point on AB not lying on any other segment from F.

Therefore, we need to find the intersection of AB with the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.

Given that AB has parametric equations:

x = (1/2)(1 - t)

y = (√3/2)t

for t from 0 to 1.

Substitute these into the astroid equation:

[ (1/2)(1 - t) ]^(2/3) + [ (√3/2 t ) ]^(2/3) = 1

Let me compute each term:

First term: [ (1/2)(1 - t) ]^(2/3) = (1/2)^(2/3) * (1 - t)^(2/3)

Second term: [ (√3/2 t ) ]^(2/3) = ( (√3/2 )^(2/3) ) * t^(2/3)

Let me compute the constants:

(1/2)^(2/3) = 2^(-2/3)

(√3/2)^(2/3) = (3^(1/2)/2)^(2/3) = 3^(1/3)/2^(2/3)

Therefore, the equation becomes:

2^(-2/3) (1 - t)^(2/3) + 3^(1/3) 2^(-2/3) t^(2/3) = 1

Factor out 2^(-2/3):

2^(-2/3) [ (1 - t)^(2/3) + 3^(1/3) t^(2/3) ] = 1

Multiply both sides by 2^(2/3):

(1 - t)^(2/3) + 3^(1/3) t^(2/3) = 2^(2/3)

Let me denote u = t^(1/3), v = (1 - t)^(1/3). Then, u^3 + v^3 = 1 - t + t = 1. But not sure if helpful.

Alternatively, let me raise both sides to the power of 3/2 to eliminate the 2/3 exponents. Wait, but raising to the 3/2 power would not necessarily simplify things. Alternatively, let's make a substitution.

Let me set t = sin^3 θ, then 1 - t = cos^3 θ. Wait, but not sure.

Alternatively, let me denote s = t^(1/3), so t = s^3, and 1 - t = 1 - s^3. Then, the equation becomes:

(1 - s^3)^(2/3) + 3^(1/3) (s^3)^(2/3) = 2^(2/3)

Simplify:

(1 - s^3)^(2/3) + 3^(1/3) s^2 = 2^(2/3)

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a better substitution.

Alternatively, let me set u = t^(1/3), so t = u^3, and 1 - t = 1 - u^3. Then:

(1 - u^3)^(2/3) + 3^(1/3) u^2 = 2^(2/3)

Let me compute numerical values to see if I can find a solution.

Wait, but maybe there's a symmetric point where t = something simple. Let me try t = 1/2. Then:

Left side: [ (1/2)(1 - 1/2) ]^(2/3) + [ (√3/2)(1/2) ]^(2/3) = [ (1/2)(1/2) ]^(2/3) + [ (√3/4 ) ]^(2/3) = (1/4)^(2/3) + ( (√3)/4 )^(2/3 )

Compute each term:

(1/4)^(2/3) = (1/2^2)^(2/3) = 2^(-4/3)

( (√3)/4 )^(2/3) = (3^(1/2)/4 )^(2/3) = 3^(1/3)/4^(2/3) = 3^(1/3)/2^(4/3)

So total:

2^(-4/3) + 3^(1/3)/2^(4/3) = [1 + 3^(1/3)] / 2^(4/3)

This is approximately [1 + 1.4422]/2.5198 ≈ 2.4422 / 2.5198 ≈ 0.97, which is less than 1. So t = 1/2 is not a solution.

Alternatively, try t = 1/3.

Left side: [ (1/2)(2/3) ]^(2/3) + [ (√3/2)(1/3) ]^(2/3) = [ (1/3) ]^(2/3) + [ (√3/6 ) ]^(2/3)

Compute:

(1/3)^(2/3) = 3^(-2/3)

(√3/6)^(2/3) = (3^(1/2)/6)^(2/3) = 3^(1/3)/6^(2/3) = 3^(1/3)/(2^(2/3) 3^(2/3)) ) = 3^(-1/3)/2^(2/3)

So total:

3^(-2/3) + 3^(-1/3)/2^(2/3) ≈ 0.48 + 0.21 ≈ 0.69 < 1

Still less than 1. Let me try t = 2/3.

Left side: [ (1/2)(1 - 2/3) ]^(2/3) + [ (√3/2)(2/3) ]^(2/3) = [ (1/2)(1/3) ]^(2/3) + [ (√3/3 ) ]^(2/3)

= (1/6)^(2/3) + (√3/3)^(2/3)

= 6^(-2/3) + (3^(1/2)/3)^(2/3)

= 6^(-2/3) + (3^(-1/2))^(2/3)

= 6^(-2/3) + 3^(-1/3)

≈ 0.29 + 0.693 ≈ 0.983 < 1

Still less than 1. Close. Let me try t = 0.8.

Left side: [ (1/2)(1 - 0.8) ]^(2/3) + [ (√3/2)(0.8) ]^(2/3) = [ (1/2)(0.2) ]^(2/3) + [ 0.4√3 ]^(2/3)

= (0.1)^(2/3) + (0.4√3 )^(2/3)

≈ 0.01^(1/3) + (0.6928)^(2/3)

≈ 0.215 + 0.41 ≈ 0.625 < 1

Hmm, perhaps the solution is when t is such that the two terms balance out. Alternatively, maybe there's a solution where t = 1/4.

Left side: [ (1/2)(3/4) ]^(2/3) + [ (√3/2)(1/4) ]^(2/3) = (3/8)^(2/3) + (√3/8)^(2/3)

≈ (0.375)^(2/3) + (0.2165)^(2/3)

≈ 0.25 + 0.12 ≈ 0.37 < 1

Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe use substitution. Let me denote s = t^(1/3), so t = s^3. Then 1 - t = 1 - s^3. The equation becomes:

(1 - s^3)^(2/3) + 3^(1/3) s^2 = 2^(2/3)

Let me cube both sides to eliminate the 2/3 exponents. Wait, but cubing both sides would complicate things because of the sum. Alternatively, let me set u = s^2, then s = sqrt(u), but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps use substitution in terms of angles. Let me consider that the astroid is parametrized by x = cos³θ, y = sin³θ. The line AB has parametric equations x = (1/2)(1 - t), y = (√3/2) t. So, to find the intersection point, set:

cos³θ = (1/2)(1 - t)

sin³θ = (√3/2) t

From these, we can solve for t in terms of θ:

From the second equation:

t = (2 / √3) sin³θ

From the first equation:

1 - t = 2 cos³θ ⇒ t = 1 - 2 cos³θ

Set equal:

(2 / √3) sin³θ = 1 - 2 cos³θ

Multiply both sides by √3:

2 sin³θ = √3 (1 - 2 cos³θ)

This seems complicated. Let me consider if there's a θ that satisfies this equation. Let me try θ = 30° (π/6 radians). Then:

sin θ = 1/2, cos θ = √3/2

Left side: 2*(1/2)^3 = 2*(1/8) = 1/4

Right side: √3*(1 - 2*(√3/2)^3 ) = √3*(1 - 2*(3√3)/8 ) = √3*(1 - (3√3)/4 ) = √3 - (9/4)

Which is approximately 1.732 - 2.25 ≈ -0.518 ≠ 1/4

Not equal. How about θ = 45° (π/4):

sin θ = cos θ = √2/2 ≈ 0.7071

Left side: 2*(√2/2)^3 = 2*( (2^(1/2))/2 )^3 = 2*(2^(3/2)/8) = 2*(2^(3/2)/8) = 2^(3/2)/4 ≈ 2.828/4 ≈ 0.707

Right side: √3*(1 - 2*(√2/2)^3 ) = √3*(1 - 2*(2^(3/2)/8 )) = √3*(1 - (2^(5/2)/8 )) = √3*(1 - (4√2)/8 ) = √3*(1 - √2/2 ) ≈ 1.732*(1 - 0.707) ≈ 1.732*0.293 ≈ 0.509

Not equal. So θ = 45°, left ≈ 0.707, right ≈ 0.509. Not equal.

Try θ = 60° (π/3):

sin θ = √3/2, cos θ = 1/2

Left side: 2*(√3/2)^3 = 2*(3√3/8) = 3√3/4 ≈ 1.299

Right side: √3*(1 - 2*(1/2)^3 ) = √3*(1 - 2*(1/8)) = √3*(1 - 1/4) = √3*(3/4) ≈ 1.732*0.75 ≈ 1.299

Oh! They are equal. So θ = 60° (π/3 radians) satisfies the equation.

Therefore, θ = π/3. Therefore, the point of tangency is at θ = π/3. Then, the coordinates are:

x = cos³(π/3) = (1/2)^3 = 1/8

y = sin³(π/3) = (√3/2)^3 = (3√3)/8

Therefore, the point C is (1/8, 3√3/8). So OC² is (1/8)^2 + (3√3/8)^2 = 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16.

Wait, but let me verify this. Since the envelope is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1, and the point (1/8, 3√3/8) lies on the astroid:

(1/8)^(2/3) + (3√3/8)^(2/3) = (1/8)^(2/3) + ( (3√3)/8 )^(2/3 )

= (1^(2/3))/(8^(2/3)) + ( (3√3)^(2/3) )/(8^(2/3))

= 1/(4) + ( (9*3)^(1/3) )/(4)

= 1/4 + (27^(1/3))/4

But 27^(1/3) = 3, so:

= 1/4 + 3/4 = 1.

Yes, so the point (1/8, 3√3/8) lies on the astroid. Therefore, this is the point where AB is tangent to the astroid, so this is the unique point on AB that lies on the astroid, and hence only on AB (since the astroid is the envelope of the family F, so each segment PQ in F is tangent to the astroid at exactly one point). Therefore, this point C is the unique point on AB not lying on any other segment from F, as required.

Therefore, the coordinates of C are (1/8, 3√3/8). Then, OC² is (1/8)^2 + (3√3/8)^2 = 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16.
