<Question>
There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.
</Question>

<think>
<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to figure out the number of ways to place some chips on a 5x5 grid following specific rules. Let me try to break down the problem step by step.

<prompt_1.1> Read the problem statement carefully and restate the problem in your own words, identifying the key constraints and what is being asked. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
First, the grid has 25 cells, each can hold at most one chip. The chips are either white or black, and all chips in the same row must be the same color. Similarly, all chips in the same column must be the same color. Also, once we place the chips, adding any more chips would violate either the row or column color condition. Hmm, okay.

So, the key constraints here are:

1. Each row can only have all chips of the same color (or none).
2. Each column can only have all chips of the same color (or none).
3. The arrangement must be maximal, meaning you can't add another chip without violating the first two conditions.

So, the problem is about finding all possible maximal colorings of the grid that satisfy the row and column color constraints with white and black chips.
</execution_1.1>
</Execution_1>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Let me start by considering what a valid configuration looks like.

First, each row must be entirely white or entirely black. Similarly, each column must be entirely white or entirely black. But since the chips are placed in the grid, the color of each row and column must be consistent with the chips already placed. However, once we place a chip in a cell, the row and column of that chip must be colored according to the chip's color. Therefore, the entire row and column of that chip must be colored with that color. But since the grid is 5x5, there might be overlapping constraints.

Wait, but the problem says "all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour". So, for any row that has chips, all chips in that row must be the same color. Similarly for columns. So, if a row has any chips, those chips must all be white or all black, and the same for columns.

But since we can't have a row with some white and some black chips, each row is either entirely white, entirely black, or empty. Similarly for columns.

<prompt_2.1> Analyze the problem constraints and identify the key property that each row and column must be monochromatic. </prompt_2.1>

But the problem also states that any additional chip would violate the conditions. So, the configuration must be such that every empty cell is in a row that already has chips of that row's color, and in a column that already has chips of that column's color. Wait, no.

<prompt_2.2> Explain the maximal condition and how it affects the possible configurations of rows and columns. </prompt_2.2>

Let me try to model this. Let's say we have a set of rows that are colored white, a set of rows colored black, and similarly for columns.

<prompt_2.3> Model the problem using sets of white and black rows and columns, and analyze the implications for the grid cells. </prompt_2.3>
-----

But let me think again. Suppose that the grid is filled with all white chips, but then you can't add any black chips. Similarly, if the grid is filled with all black chips, you can't add any white chips. So those are two configurations.

But what about configurations where some rows and columns are white and some are black, but arranged in such a way that adding any chip would violate the row or column condition.

<prompt_2.4> Consider configurations with mixed rows and columns and analyze the maximal condition. </prompt_2.4>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Similarly, each column is either entirely white, entirely black, or empty. However, since we have to place some chips, not all rows and columns can be empty. Also, the arrangement must be such that adding another chip is impossible. That means for every empty cell, either its row already has chips of that row's color, or its column already has chips of that column's color. Wait, no, actually, the condition is that adding any additional chip would violate one of the previous two conditions. So, for every empty cell, if we place a chip there, it would either cause its row to have chips of different colors (which isn't possible since rows can only be one color) or its column to have chips of different colors. Wait, but since rows and columns are only one color, adding a chip of a different color would violate the row or column color condition. But the problem says "all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour". So, if a row is all white, you can't place a black chip in that row. Similarly, if a column is all black, you can't place a white chip in that column. Therefore, the color of a row or column is fixed once any chip is placed in that row or column. Therefore, the color of a row is determined by the color of any chip in that row, and similarly for columns.

Therefore, the grid must be a union of entirely white rows and entirely black rows, and entirely white columns and entirely black columns. But since rows and columns are interrelated, there might be some constraints here.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Actually, it's the opposite. If there's a cell that is empty, then adding a chip there would either create a row or column that has a different color than the existing chips in that row or column. Wait, but if you can't add any chip without violating the row or column condition, that means that every empty cell is in a row that already has chips of a certain color, and that row's color is the color of the cell. But if the cell is empty, then adding a chip there would require that row to be the color of that chip, but the column of that cell must also already have chips of the same color. Wait, this is getting a bit tangled.

Let me try to rephrase. The grid must be such that for every empty cell (i,j), either:

1. The entire row i is already colored with a color different from the color that would be placed in cell (i,j), or
2. The entire column j is already colored with a color different from the color that would be placed in cell (i,j).

But since we can only place chips of the same color in a row or column, if we were to place a chip in (i,j), it would have to be the same color as the rest of row i or column j. Therefore, if row i is already colored with color C, then placing a chip in (i,j) would require column j to also be color C. Similarly, if column j is already colored with color D, then placing a chip in (i,j) would require row i to be color D.

But since we can't have both row i and column j colored, unless they are the same color. Wait, this is confusing. Let me think.

Suppose we have a cell (i,j) that is empty. If we could place a chip there, then the color of that chip must be the same as the color of row i and the color of column j. Therefore, for the configuration to be maximal, it must be that either row i is already colored with a color different from column j's color, or column j is already colored with a color different from row i's color. Because otherwise, we could place a chip in (i,j) with the color of row i (which is the same as column j's color), and it would satisfy both row and column conditions.

But since the configuration is maximal, there should be no such cell (i,j) where row i and column j have the same color. Because otherwise, we could add a chip there. Therefore, the condition is that for every cell (i,j), either row i is colored differently from column j's color, or column j is colored differently from row i's color. Which is equivalent to saying that no row and column have the same color. Because if they did, then there would be a cell where you could add a chip.

Wait, that seems like a key insight. If any row and column have the same color, then their intersection cell could be filled, which would violate the maximality. Therefore, the rows and columns must be colored such that no row color is equal to any column color. Wait, but there are only two colors, white and black. So, if we have rows colored white and columns colored black, then no row and column share the same color. Similarly, if rows are black and columns are white, same thing. If both rows and columns are white, then every row and column is white, so you can't add any black chips, but you can add white chips anywhere, which would violate the maximality because you could add a white chip in an empty cell. Wait, no. If all rows and columns are white, then you can't add any black chips. But you could add white chips in empty cells. But adding a white chip in an empty cell would mean that row and column are still white, so it's allowed. Therefore, that configuration isn't maximal because you can add white chips.

Similarly, if all rows and columns are black, you can add black chips anywhere, so it's not maximal.

Therefore, the only maximal configurations are those where either:

1. All rows are white and all columns are black.
2. All rows are black and all columns are white.

Because in these cases, there are no cells where both the row and column are the same color. Therefore, you can't add any chips.

Wait, let's check that.
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
Similarly, some columns are white, some are black, and some are empty. But the key is that the placement of chips must be such that if a chip is placed in a cell, then the entire row and column of that cell must be colored with the color of the chip. But the problem also states that any additional chip would violate the previous conditions. So, the configuration must be maximal in the sense that you can't add any more chips without violating the row or column color constraints.

Wait, but if we have a row colored white, then all cells in that row must be white if they are to have chips. Similarly, if a column is colored black, all cells in that column must be black if they have chips. So, the problem reduces to selecting a subset of rows and columns, coloring them white or black, such that the intersection of a white row and a black column can't have both a white and black chip. Wait, but the chips are placed in the grid, so each cell can have at most one chip. Therefore, if a cell is in a white row and a black column, it can have a white chip (if the row is white) or a black chip (if the column is black), but not both. However, in our problem, we are placing some chips, so each chip must be in a cell that is in a white row and a white column (if it's white) or in a black row and a black column (if it's black). Wait, no.

Wait, actually, if a row is white, then all cells in that row must be white if they have chips. Similarly, if a column is white, all cells in that column must be white if they have chips. Therefore, the intersection of a white row and a white column can have a white chip. Similarly, the intersection of a black row and a black column can have a black chip. However, if a white row intersects with a black column, the cell can't have a chip, because that would violate both the row and column color conditions. Similarly, a black row intersecting a white column can't have a chip. So, the grid is divided into four regions:

1. White rows intersecting white columns: can have white chips.
2. Black rows intersecting black columns: can have black chips.
3. White rows intersecting black columns: cannot have chips.
4. Black rows intersecting white columns: cannot have chips.

Therefore, the grid is partitioned into two blocks: the intersection of white rows and white columns (let's call this the white block) and the intersection of black rows and black columns (the black block). The other two blocks (white rows with black columns and black rows with white columns) cannot have any chips. Therefore, the problem reduces to selecting subsets of rows and columns, coloring them white or black, such that the white rows and white columns form a rectangle (the white block), and the black rows and black columns form another rectangle (the black block), and these two rectangles are disjoint (i.e., they don't overlap in any cell). The rest of the grid (the cells in white rows with black columns and black rows with white columns) must be empty.

But also, the configuration must be maximal. That is, you can't add another chip anywhere without violating the row or column color conditions. So, for the configuration to be maximal, every empty cell must be in a row that is already entirely colored (either white or black) or in a column that is already entirely colored. Wait, no. Let's think.

If a cell is empty, then either its row is already colored (white or black) or its column is already colored (white or black). Wait, but if a cell is empty, then its row is either white or black. If the row is white, then all cells in that row must be white, so the entire row is white. Similarly, if the row is black, the entire row is black. Similarly for columns. Therefore, if a cell is empty, then its entire row and column must already be colored. Therefore, the only way to have an empty cell is if its row and column are already colored (with the same color, since the cell is empty). Therefore, the configuration must be such that all empty cells are in rows and columns that are already colored. So, the white block and black block must cover all rows and columns? Wait, no. Wait, if a row is colored white, then all cells in that row must be white if they have chips. Similarly, if a row is colored black, all cells in that row must be black if they have chips. But if a row is not colored (i.e., it's empty), then it can't have any chips. Similarly for columns. Therefore, the rows and columns that are colored (white or black) must form a subgrid where the intersection is the white block and the black block. The rest of the grid (cells in uncolored rows or uncolored columns) must be empty.

But the problem states that the configuration must be maximal, meaning that you can't add any more chips. So, if a row is colored white, then all cells in that row that are in colored columns must be white. Similarly, if a column is colored white, all cells in that column that are in colored rows must be white. Therefore, the white block is the intersection of colored white rows and colored white columns, and the black block is the intersection of colored black rows and colored black columns. The cells in colored white rows and colored black columns must be empty, as well as cells in colored black rows and colored white columns. The cells in uncolored rows or uncolored columns must also be empty.

Therefore, the configuration is determined by choosing a subset of rows to color white, a subset of columns to color white, a subset of rows to color black (disjoint from the white rows), and a subset of columns to color black (disjoint from the white columns). The white block is the intersection of white rows and white columns, the black block is the intersection of black rows and black columns, and the rest are empty. The total number of such configurations would be the product of the number of ways to choose white rows and white columns, and black rows and black columns, such that the white rows and black rows are disjoint, and the white columns and black columns are disjoint.

But the problem is that the total number of configurations is the number of ways to partition the rows into white and black, and the columns into white and black, and then the white block is the intersection, black block is the intersection, and the rest are empty. However, the problem states that the configuration must be maximal. So, in addition to the above, the configuration must be such that you can't add any more chips. Therefore, every empty cell must be in a row that is already entirely colored or in a column that is already entirely colored. Wait, but if a cell is empty, and its row is colored (white or black), then the entire row is colored, so all cells in that row are either white or black. Similarly, if its column is colored, all cells in that column are either white or black. Therefore, the empty cells must be in rows and columns that are already colored. Therefore, the entire grid is covered by the white block, black block, and the rest of the grid (uncolored rows and columns) must be empty. Therefore, the configuration is determined by choosing white rows, white columns, black rows, and black columns, with white rows disjoint from black rows, and white columns disjoint from black columns. Then, the white block is the intersection of white rows and white columns, black block is the intersection of black rows and black columns, and the rest are empty. However, the problem is that the configuration must be maximal, so that you can't add any more chips. Therefore, all empty cells must be in rows or columns that are already colored. But if a cell is empty, then its row and column must be already colored. Therefore, the only way to have an empty cell is if its row is colored and its column is colored. Therefore, the entire grid is covered by the white block, black block, and the rest (uncolored rows or columns) must be empty. Therefore, the configuration is determined by choosing white rows and white columns, black rows and black columns, with white rows and black rows disjoint, white columns and black columns disjoint. Then, the white block is the intersection of white rows and white columns, black block is the intersection of black rows and black columns, and the rest are empty. So, the number of such configurations is the number of ways to choose white rows, white columns, black rows, and black columns, with white rows and black rows disjoint, white columns and black columns disjoint.

But the problem also states that we can place some chips, so the total number of configurations is the number of ways to choose such partitions, and then the number of ways to place chips in the white block and black block. Wait, no. Wait, in the problem, the chips are placed such that each cell contains at most one chip, and the chips are placed according to the row and column color constraints. So, once the rows and columns are colored, the chips can be placed in any subset of the white block and black block. However, the problem says "all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour", so each row that has any chips must be entirely white or entirely black. Similarly for columns. Therefore, the configuration is determined by the rows and columns that are colored, and the placement of chips in the white block and black block. However, the problem also states that the configuration must be maximal, meaning that adding any chip would violate the conditions. Therefore, the configuration must be such that every empty cell is in a row that is already colored or in a column that is already colored. Therefore, the empty cells are precisely those in the uncolored rows or uncolored columns. Therefore, the white block and black block must cover all rows and columns? Wait, no. Wait, if a row is not colored, then it can't have any chips. Similarly for a column. Therefore, if a row is not colored, then all cells in that row must be empty. Similarly for columns. Therefore, the configuration is determined by choosing subsets of rows and columns to color (white or black), and then placing chips in the white block and black block. However, the problem requires that the configuration is maximal, meaning that you can't add any more chips. Therefore, every empty cell must be in a row or column that is already colored. Therefore, the empty cells are those in uncolored rows or uncolored columns. Therefore, the white block and black block must be such that all cells in colored rows and colored columns are covered by the white or black blocks. Wait, this is getting a bit confusing.

Let me try to model this more formally.
</execution_2.3>

<execution_2.4>
For example, if I have a configuration where some rows are white and some are black, and some columns are white and some are black. Then, any empty cell must be in a row of some color and a column of some color. If the cell is white, then its row must be white, and its column must be white. But if the column is black, then placing a white chip in that cell would make the column have a black chip in that cell and a white chip elsewhere, which violates the column color condition. Similarly, if the cell is black, then its row must be black and its column must be black. If the column is white, placing a black chip would violate the column condition.

Therefore, for a configuration to be maximal, every empty cell must be in a row of some color and a column of some color. If the row is white and the column is black, then placing a white chip in that cell would make the column have both black and white chips, which is invalid. Similarly, if the row is black and the column is white, placing a black chip would make the row have both colors. So, in order for the configuration to be maximal, every empty cell must be in a row and column of the same color. That is, the intersection of a row and column of different colors must be filled. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Suppose there is an empty cell at position (i,j). If row i is white and column j is black, then placing a white chip at (i,j) would make column j have both white and black chips, which is invalid. Similarly, placing a black chip there would make row i have both colors. Therefore, such a cell cannot be filled. Therefore, in order for the configuration to be maximal, all cells where row i is white and column j is black must already be filled, and similarly for black rows and white columns. Wait, but if a cell is empty and row i is white and column j is black, then we cannot place a chip there. Therefore, if the configuration is maximal, then all cells where row i is white and column j is black must already be filled, otherwise, we could place a chip there. Similarly, all cells where row i is black and column j is white must be filled. Therefore, the set of cells that are white must be exactly the union of white rows and white columns? Wait, maybe not. Let me formalize this.

Let W be the set of white rows and B be the set of black rows. Similarly, let C be the set of white columns and D be the set of black columns. Then, the cells that are white must be in the intersection of white rows and white columns, i.e., W × C. Similarly, the cells that are black must be in the intersection of black rows and black columns, i.e., B × D. The cells that are in white rows and black columns, W × D, must be entirely filled with white chips, otherwise, we could place a white chip there. Similarly, the cells in black rows and white columns, B × C, must be entirely filled with black chips. Otherwise, we could place a black chip there.

Therefore, for the configuration to be maximal, the following must hold:

1. All cells in W × D must be filled with white chips.
2. All cells in B × C must be filled with black chips.

Because otherwise, you could place a chip there.

Moreover, the cells in W × C can be either filled or not, but if you leave them empty, then you can't place any chips there. Similarly, cells in B × D can be empty, but you can't place any chips there.

Wait, so the only cells that can be empty are those in W × C and B × D. If you leave those empty, then adding any chip there would violate the conditions. Therefore, the configuration is determined by:

- Choosing some white rows W and black rows B (with W ∪ B = all rows).
- Choosing some white columns C and black columns D (with C ∪ D = all columns).
- Then, the cells in W × D must be white, and the cells in B × C must be black.
- The cells in W × C and B × D can be empty or filled?

Wait, no. Because if there are any cells in W × C that are empty, then you could place a white chip there, since the row is white and the column is white. Wait, no. If the column is white, then placing a white chip in a white row and white column is allowed, but then the column would have a white chip. But if the column is white, all its cells must be white. Therefore, if the column is white, all cells in that column must be white. Therefore, if a column is white, then all cells in that column must be white, regardless of the row. Similarly, if a row is white, all cells in that row must be white, regardless of the column.

Wait, this seems contradictory. Let me clarify.

If a column is white, then every cell in that column must be white. Similarly, if a row is white, every cell in that row must be white. Therefore, if a column is white, then all cells in that column are white, regardless of the row. Similarly, if a row is white, all cells in that row are white, regardless of the column. Therefore, if a column is white, then all cells in that column must be white, which includes cells in both white and black rows. Similarly, if a row is white, all cells in that row must be white, which includes cells in both white and black columns.

Wait, this seems like a key point. So, if we decide that column j is white, then every cell in column j must be white. Therefore, if column j is white, then for every row i, the cell (i,j) must be white. Similarly, if row i is white, then for every column j, the cell (i,j) must be white. Therefore, the sets of white rows and white columns are not independent. If you have a white column, all cells in that column must be white, which includes cells in black rows. Similarly, if you have a white row, all cells in that row must be white, which includes cells in black columns.

Therefore, the presence of a white column forces all cells in that column to be white, which affects the rows. Similarly, a white row forces all cells in that row to be white, affecting the columns.

Therefore, the coloring is determined by the choice of white rows and white columns, but with the constraint that if a column is white, all cells in that column are white, which includes cells in black rows. Similarly, if a row is white, all cells in that row are white, which includes cells in black columns.

But this seems like a lot of overlap. Let me try to formalize this.

Suppose we choose a set of white rows W and a set of white columns C. Then, the cells that must be white are:

- All cells in W (regardless of column) and all cells in C (regardless of row). But wait, if a cell is in both a white row and a white column, it's already covered. However, if a cell is in a white row but not in a white column, then it must be white because the row is white. Similarly, if a cell is in a white column but not in a white row, then it must be white because the column is white. However, if a cell is in neither a white row nor a white column, then its color is not determined yet. But according to the problem, all chips in the same row and column must be the same color. So, if a row is not white, it must be black, and similarly for columns. Therefore, the color of a cell is determined by the color of its row and column.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me think again.

Each row must be entirely white or black. Similarly, each column must be entirely white or black. Therefore, the color of a row and the color of a column must be compatible. If a cell is in a white row and a black column, then the cell must be white (because the row is white) and black (because the column is black), which is a contradiction. Therefore, such a cell cannot exist. Therefore, the only way this is possible is if every white row is such that all columns intersecting it are also white, or every black column is such that all rows intersecting it are also black.

Wait, this is similar to the concept of a union of rows and columns being monochromatic. Let me think.

Suppose we have some white rows and some black rows. For the columns, if a column is white, then all cells in that column must be white, which includes cells from white and black rows. Similarly, if a column is black, all cells in that column must be black. Therefore, the set of white columns must cover all the cells in the white rows. Because if a row is white, all its cells must be white, so every column intersecting that row must be white. Otherwise, if a column is black, then the cell in that column and row would have to be black, but the row is white, which is a contradiction.

Therefore, the set of white columns must include all columns that intersect any white row. Similarly, the set of black columns must include all columns that intersect any black row. Wait, no. Let me clarify.

If a row is white, then all cells in that row must be white. Therefore, every column that intersects this row must be white, because otherwise, the cell in that column and row would have to be both white (from the row) and black (from the column), which is impossible. Therefore, if a row is white, all columns that intersect that row must be white. Similarly, if a column is black, all rows that intersect that column must be black.

Therefore, the white rows must be a subset of the rows such that all columns intersecting them are white. Similarly, black columns must be a subset of columns such that all rows intersecting them are black.

This seems like a constraint that the white rows and white columns must form a rectangle. Wait, maybe not. Let me think. If I have a white row, then all columns must be white. Therefore, if any row is white, all columns must be white. Similarly, if any column is black, all rows must be black. Therefore, the only possible configurations are:

1. All columns are white. Then, all rows can be either white or black. But if all columns are white, then each row must be entirely white (since all columns are white, so each cell in the row is white). Therefore, all rows must be white. Therefore, the only configuration here is all cells are white.

2. All rows are black. Then, all columns must be black, as each row is black. Therefore, the only configuration here is all cells are black.

3. If there are some white rows and some black rows. But if there are white rows, then all columns must be white. Because, as per above, if any row is white, all columns must be white. Similarly, if there are black columns, then all rows must be black. Therefore, the only way to have mixed rows and columns is if all columns are white (so all rows must be white) or all columns are black (so all rows must be black). Therefore, the only possible configurations are all white, all black, or a mix where the white rows and white columns are such that they form a rectangle. Wait, no. Wait, if some rows are white and some columns are white, but not all columns are white. Wait, but if any row is white, all columns must be white. Therefore, you cannot have a white row without all columns being white. Similarly, you cannot have a black column without all rows being black. Therefore, the only possibilities are:

- All white.
- All black.
- Some white columns and some black columns, but all rows must be white or all rows must be black. Wait, no. Let's think again.

If there are both white and black columns, then the rows that are black must intersect only black columns. Similarly, the rows that are white must intersect only white columns. But if a row is white, then all columns must be white (since the row is white, all its cells must be white, so the columns must be white). Therefore, if there is a white row, all columns must be white. Similarly, if there is a black column, all rows must be black. Therefore, the only possibilities are:

- All white.
- All black.
- A set of white columns and black columns, but if any white column exists, all rows must be white. If any black column exists, all rows must be black. Therefore, the only possible configurations are:

1. All white.
2. All black.
3. All rows white, some columns white and some columns black. Wait, but if any column is black, then all rows must be black. Therefore, if there is a black column, all rows must be black. Therefore, the only way to have mixed columns (some white, some black) is if all rows are white. But if all rows are white, then all columns must be white. Therefore, you cannot have a configuration where all rows are white but some columns are black. Similarly, you cannot have all columns white but some rows black. Therefore, the only possible configurations are all white, all black, or a configuration where all rows are white and all columns are white, which is the same as all white. Similarly, all rows black and all columns black, which is all black.

Wait, this seems like there are only two configurations: all white and all black. But this contradicts the problem statement, which suggests that there are more configurations. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, let me think again. Suppose that not all rows are white. Suppose there is at least one black row. Then, according to the previous logic, all columns must be black. Because if there is a black row, then all columns must be black. Similarly, if there is a black column, all rows must be black. Therefore, the only possible configurations are:

- All white (all rows white, all columns white).
- All black (all rows black, all columns black).

But this seems too restrictive. However, the problem states that the configuration must be maximal, meaning you can't add any more chips without violating the conditions. So, maybe there are other configurations where you can't add any chips, even if not all cells are filled.

Wait, for example, suppose we have a 5x5 grid where the first row is white and the rest are black. Then, the first row must be all white, and the other rows must be all black. Then, the columns: the first column (which has one white cell) must be all white or all black. If the first column is white, then all cells in column 1 must be white, which would require the other rows (which are black) to have white cells in column 1, which is a contradiction. Therefore, the first column must be black. Therefore, all cells in column 1 must be black. Therefore, the first row is white, so cell (1,1) is white, but column 1 must be black, which is a contradiction. Therefore, such a configuration is impossible.

Therefore, if we have any white row, then all columns must be white. Similarly, any black column requires all rows to be black. Therefore, the only possible configurations are all white or all black. But this seems to contradict the problem's requirement of having some chips placed and being maximal. Wait, but if all cells are filled, then you can't add any more chips, but the problem says "some of these chips", so you don't have to fill all cells. So, maybe there are configurations where some cells are filled, but adding any other cell would violate the conditions.

Let me think of an example. Suppose we have a 5x5 grid where the first row is white, and the first column is white. Then, according to the previous reasoning, all cells in the first row and first column must be white. But if the first row is white, then all columns must be white. Therefore, the first column is white, which implies all rows must be white. Therefore, all rows must be white, which implies all columns must be white. Therefore, the entire grid must be white. So, in this case, the only possible configuration is all white.

Alternatively, suppose we have a 5x5 grid where the first row is white and the second row is black. Then, according to the previous logic, the first row is white, so all columns must be white. Therefore, the second row being black would require that all columns are black, which contradicts the first row being white. Therefore, such a configuration is impossible.

Wait, so maybe the only possible configurations are all white or all black. But that seems too restrictive. However, the problem statement says "some of these chips in the 25 unit cells", so perhaps the all white or all black configurations are the only maximal ones. But then the answer would be 2, which seems too simple. But maybe there are more.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that if a row is white, all columns must be white. Let me check again.

Suppose we have a row that is white. Then, all cells in that row must be white. But each column that intersects this row must be either white or black. If a column is black, then all cells in that column must be black. But the cell in the white row and black column would have to be both white (from the row) and black (from the column), which is impossible. Therefore, such a column cannot exist. Therefore, if a row is white, all columns must be white. Similarly, if a column is black, all rows must be black.

Therefore, the only possible configurations are:

1. All columns white (so all rows must be white).
2. All columns black (so all rows must be black).
3. All rows white (so all columns must be white).
4. All rows black (so all columns must be black).

But these all reduce to the entire grid being white or black. Therefore, the only maximal configurations are all white or all black. But this seems to contradict the problem's mention of "some of these chips". However, if all cells are filled, then adding any other chip (which isn't there) would not violate the conditions. But according to the problem, "any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions". So, if all cells are filled, then adding any chip (which isn't there) would not violate the conditions. Therefore, the all white and all black configurations are maximal. But perhaps there are other configurations where not all cells are filled, but adding any cell would violate the conditions.

Wait, let's consider a smaller example. Suppose we have a 1x1 grid. Then, the only configurations are all white or all black. Both are maximal. Now, consider a 2x2 grid.

Suppose we have a 2x2 grid where the first row is white (so both cells in the first row are white) and the first column is white (so both cells in the first column are white). Then, according to the previous logic, all columns must be white, so the second row must be white. Therefore, the entire grid is white. Similarly, if the first row is black and the first column is black, then the entire grid is black.

Alternatively, suppose we have a 2x2 grid where the first row is white and the second row is black. Then, according to the previous logic, the first row being white requires all columns to be white, which would force the second row to be white, contradicting the second row being black. Therefore, such a configuration is impossible.

Alternatively, suppose we have a 2x2 grid where the first column is white and the second column is black. Then, the first column being white requires all rows to be white, forcing the second column to be white, which contradicts the second column being black. Therefore, impossible.

Therefore, in the 2x2 case, the only maximal configurations are all white or all black. But the problem allows for some chips. So, in the 2x2 case, the only maximal configurations are all white or all black. Therefore, the answer would be 2.

But the problem is about a 5x5 grid. So, perhaps the answer is 2. But the problem seems to imply that there are more possibilities. Maybe I need to re-examine the problem statement.

Wait, the problem says "some of these chips in the 25 unit cells of a 5×5 grid". So, not necessarily all cells. But the conditions are:

- Each cell contains at most one chip.
- All chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour.
- Any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

Therefore, the configuration must be such that every empty cell is in a row or column that already has a chip of the same color. Otherwise, you could add a chip there. Wait, no. If a cell is in a row that has chips of some color, but the column of that cell has different color chips, then you can't add a chip there. For example, if a cell is in a white row and a black column, you can't add a chip there because the row is white and the column is black. But if the column is white, then all cells in that column must be white, so the cell is white. If the column is black, then the cell can't be white. Therefore, the only way to have a cell empty is if it's in a row of some color and a column of the same color. Otherwise, you can't add a chip there.

Therefore, the empty cells must be in the intersection of a white row and a white column, or a black row and a black column. Because otherwise, you can add a chip there. Therefore, the empty cells are precisely those in the intersection of white rows and white columns, or black rows and black columns. Therefore, the filled cells are those in the intersection of white rows and black columns, or black rows and white columns. Wait, no. Let me clarify.

If a cell is in a white row and a black column, then it can't be filled because the row is white and the column is black. Similarly, if it's in a black row and a white column, it can't be filled. Therefore, the filled cells are those in white rows and white columns, or black rows and black columns. Wait, no. If a cell is in a white row and a white column, then it must be white. If it's in a black row and a black column, it must be black. But if a cell is in a white row and a black column, it can't be filled. Similarly, if it's in a black row and a white column, it can't be filled.

Therefore, the filled cells are in the intersections of white rows and white columns, or black rows and black columns. The empty cells are in the intersections of white rows and black columns, or black rows and white columns. But for the configuration to be maximal, every empty cell must be in a row and column of the same color. Wait, no. For example, the empty cell in a white row and black column is in a white row and black column, which are different colors. Therefore, you can't add a chip there. Similarly, an empty cell in a black row and white column can't have a chip added because the row is black and the column is white. Therefore, the condition is satisfied.

But then, the filled cells are those in white rows and white columns, or black rows and black columns. Therefore, the filled cells form a union of white×white and black×black cells. The filled cells are exactly the cells where the row and column colors are the same. The empty cells are where the row and column colors are different.

Therefore, the problem reduces to choosing subsets of rows and columns such that:

- The rows are partitioned into white and black rows.
- The columns are partitioned into white and black columns.
- The filled cells are exactly those in white rows and white columns, or black rows and black columns.
- The configuration is maximal, meaning that you can't add any more chips without violating the row or column color condition. Which, as per above, is already satisfied because all empty cells are in rows and columns of different colors, so adding a chip there would require that row and column to have the same color, which they don't.

Wait, but this seems like any configuration where the rows and columns are colored such that the filled cells are where the row and column colors match. Therefore, the number of such configurations would be the number of ways to color the rows and columns with white and black, and then fill the cells where the row and column colors are the same.

But each such configuration must be maximal. But according to the problem, the grid must be maximal, meaning that adding any chip would violate the conditions. But in the above reasoning, the configuration is already maximal because all empty cells are in rows and columns of different colors. Therefore, the number of such configurations is equal to the number of ways to color the rows and columns with white and black.

However, each such coloring corresponds to a partition of the grid into four regions:

- White rows and white columns: filled with white.
- Black rows and white columns: empty.
- White rows and black columns: empty.
- Black rows and black columns: filled with black.

But for the configuration to be valid, the filled cells must be exactly those in white rows and white columns, or black rows and black columns. Therefore, the number of configurations is equal to the number of ways to choose subsets of rows and subsets of columns, color them white or black, and then fill the cells where the row and column colors match.

But this seems like the number of such configurations would be 2^(5+5) = 2^10 = 1024, since each row can be independently colored white or black, and each column can be independently colored white or black. However, this is not correct because the problem states that the configuration must be maximal, which in this case is automatically satisfied. But the problem says "any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions". However, in the configurations where rows and columns are colored arbitrarily, adding a chip to an empty cell would require that row and column to be the same color, which they are not, so it's impossible. Therefore, all such configurations are maximal. Therefore, the total number would be 2^10 = 1024.

But the problem says "some of these chips in the 25 unit cells", so not necessarily all. Therefore, the answer would be 1024.

But the problem seems to suggest that there are more constraints, perhaps? Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the rows and columns can be any combination of white and black, but there might be some constraints based on the interactions between the rows and columns. For example, if a row is white, then all columns must be white. Wait, no. If a row is white, then the cells in that row must be white, which implies that the columns intersecting that row must be white. Similarly, if a column is black, then the rows intersecting that column must be black.

Wait, this is similar to the earlier reasoning. If a row is white, then all columns must be white. Because the cells in that row must be white, which requires that the columns are white. Similarly, if a column is black, then all rows must be black. Therefore, the only possible configurations are:

1. All rows white and all columns white.
2. All rows black and all columns black.
3. All rows white and all columns black. Wait, but if all rows are white, then all columns must be white. Similarly, if all columns are black, then all rows must be black. Therefore, the only possible configurations are all white or all black.

But this contradicts the earlier conclusion that any coloring of rows and columns is allowed. Therefore, there must be a mistake here.

Wait, let's take a concrete example. Suppose we have a 2x2 grid.

Case 1: Rows 1 and 2 are white; columns 1 and 2 are white. Then, all cells are white. Maximal.

Case 2: Rows 1 and 2 are white; columns 1 is white, column 2 is black. Then, column 2 is black, so all rows must be black. Contradiction, since row 1 is white. Therefore, invalid.

Case 3: Rows 1 is white, row 2 is black; columns 1 is white, column 2 is white. Then, column 1 is white, so all rows must be white. Contradiction, since row 2 is black. Invalid.

Case 4: Rows 1 is white, row 2 is black; columns 1 is black, column 2 is black. Then, columns 1 and 2 are black, so all rows must be black. Contradiction, since row 1 is white. Invalid.

Case 5: Rows 1 is black, row 2 is black; columns 1 is white, column 2 is white. Then, rows are black, so columns must be black. Contradiction. Invalid.

Case 6: Rows 1 is black, row 2 is black; columns 1 is black, column 2 is black. All cells black. Maximal.

Therefore, in the 2x2 case, the only valid configurations are all white or all black. Therefore, the number of configurations is 2.

But according to the earlier reasoning where each row and column is colored independently, we would have 2^(2+2) = 16 configurations, but many of them are invalid. For example, if rows are colored [white, black] and columns are colored [white, black], then row 1 is white, column 1 is white, so cell (1,1) is white. Similarly, row 1 is white, column 2 is black, so cell (1,2) is white. But column 2 is black, which requires all rows to be black, but row 1 is white. Contradiction. Therefore, such a configuration is invalid.

Therefore, the only valid configurations are those where all rows are white and all columns are white, or all rows are black and all columns are black. Therefore, in the 2x2 case, only 2 configurations. Therefore, the answer is 2.

But the problem is about a 5x5 grid. So, similarly, the only valid configurations are all white or all black. Therefore, the answer would be 2. But this seems too simple, and the problem must have a more complex answer. Therefore, my earlier reasoning must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that if a row is white, all columns must be white. Let's re-examine that.

If a row is white, then all cells in that row must be white. These cells belong to their respective columns. If any column intersecting that row is colored black, then the cell in that column and row would have to be black (since the column is black), but the row is white, which is a contradiction. Therefore, any column intersecting a white row must be white. Therefore, if a row is white, all columns are white. Similarly, if a column is black, all rows are black.

Therefore, the only possible configurations are:

1. All columns white (so all rows must be white).
2. All columns black (so all rows must be black).

Therefore, the only configurations are all white or all black. Therefore, the answer is 2.

But this seems too straightforward. However, according to the problem statement, the answer is likely 62, as this is a common result for such problems. Therefore, my reasoning must be flawed.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently. Let's consider that the problem allows for some cells to be empty, but the conditions must hold for the cells that are filled. The key is that the configuration is maximal, meaning that adding any chip (i.e., filling any empty cell) would violate the row or column color condition.

Therefore, the filled cells must form a set where every empty cell is in a row and column of different colors. Therefore, the filled cells are those where the row and column colors match. Therefore, the number of such configurations is equal to the number of ways to color the rows and columns such that the filled cells are exactly where the row and column colors match.

However, for the configuration to be maximal, there must be no empty cell that is in a row and column of the same color. Wait, no. The filled cells are where the row and column colors match, and the empty cells are where they don't. Therefore, the configuration is already maximal because adding a chip to an empty cell would require that the row and column colors match, which they don't. Therefore, any configuration where the filled cells are exactly those where row and column colors match is automatically maximal. Therefore, the number of such configurations is equal to the number of ways to color the rows and columns with white and black.

But each row can be independently colored white or black, and each column can be independently colored white or black. Therefore, there are 2^5 (rows) * 2^5 (columns) = 1024 possible configurations. However, some of these configurations may not satisfy the condition that all filled cells are exactly where row and column colors match. But actually, in such a configuration, the filled cells are exactly where row and column colors match. Therefore, all 1024 configurations are valid.

But this seems to contradict the earlier reasoning where certain configurations would lead to contradictions. However, in reality, if a row is white, then all columns must be white, so such configurations are invalid. But according to this new reasoning, rows and columns can be colored independently. Therefore, there's a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the coloring of rows and columns must be such that the filled cells are exactly those where row and column colors match. Therefore, the coloring must be such that the rows and columns are colored in a way that the filled cells are in their intersection. However, if a row is colored white, then all columns must be white, which would force all columns to be white, making all rows white. Similarly, if a column is colored black, all rows must be black. Therefore, the only valid colorings are all rows white and all columns white, or all rows black and all columns black. Therefore, the answer is 2.

But this contradicts the earlier idea that rows and columns can be colored independently. Therefore, the mistake in the earlier reasoning is assuming that the coloring of rows and columns can be independent, but in reality, the coloring is interdependent. Specifically, if any row is colored white, then all columns must be white. Similarly, if any column is colored black, all rows must be black.

Therefore, the only possible colorings are:

1. All rows white, all columns white.
2. All rows black, all columns black.

Therefore, the answer is 2.

But this seems too simple, and the problem is likely more complex. Therefore, perhaps the mistake is in assuming that the filled cells are exactly those where row and column colors match. But according to the problem statement, the filled cells must satisfy that all chips in the same row and column have the same color. Therefore, if a row is white, all its cells must be white, and if a column is white, all its cells must be white. Therefore, the filled cells are exactly those in white rows and white columns, or black rows and black columns. However, the problem says that the configuration must be maximal, meaning that adding any chip would violate the conditions. Therefore, the empty cells must be in rows and columns of different colors, so you can't add a chip there. Therefore, the number of configurations is equal to the number of ways to color the rows and columns such that the filled cells are exactly those in white rows and white columns, or black rows and black columns. However, the coloring of rows and columns is independent, but with the caveat that if a row is white, all columns must be white, and if a column is black, all rows must be black.

Wait, no. If a row is white, then all columns must be white. Therefore, the only possible colorings are:

1. All rows white, all columns white. (All cells white)
2. All rows black, all columns black. (All cells black)
3. All rows white, all columns black. (Impossible, because columns black would require all rows black)
4. All rows black, all columns white. (Impossible, because rows black would require all columns black)

Therefore, only two configurations are possible: all white or all black. Therefore, the answer is 2.

But this seems to contradict the problem's implication that there are more possibilities. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in reasoning.

Wait, let's think of a different approach. Suppose that the rows and columns are colored with two colors, white and black, but not necessarily all rows the same color or all columns the same color. However, the filled cells must be exactly those in white rows and white columns, or black rows and black columns. The problem is that such a configuration would require that if a row is white, all columns must be white, and if a column is black, all rows must be black. Therefore, the only possible colorings are all white or all black. Therefore, the answer is 2.

<Plan_3>
However, this seems to contradict the problem's implication that there are more possibilities. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in reasoning.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in assuming that the filled cells must be exactly those in white rows and white columns or black rows and black columns. Maybe the filled cells can be any subset of those intersections, as long as the row and column colors are consistent. For example, you can have some white rows and white columns, and some black rows and black columns, but not all. However, this would create empty cells that are in white rows and black columns, which are allowed because adding a chip there would require the row and column to be the same color, which they aren't. Therefore, the configuration is maximal. Therefore, the number of such configurations would be the number of ways to choose subsets of rows and columns such that:

- The chosen white rows and white columns form a rectangle of filled cells.
- The chosen black rows and black columns form another rectangle of filled cells.
- The cells in white rows and black columns, as well as black rows and white columns, remain empty.

However, these subsets must be such that the white rows and white columns form a rectangle, and the black rows and black columns form another rectangle. But these rectangles can be anywhere on the grid, as long as they don't overlap in a way that would cause contradictions. However, if a row is white, all columns must be white, and if a column is black, all rows must be black. Therefore, this approach is invalid.

Therefore, the only valid configurations are all white or all black. Therefore, the answer is 2.
