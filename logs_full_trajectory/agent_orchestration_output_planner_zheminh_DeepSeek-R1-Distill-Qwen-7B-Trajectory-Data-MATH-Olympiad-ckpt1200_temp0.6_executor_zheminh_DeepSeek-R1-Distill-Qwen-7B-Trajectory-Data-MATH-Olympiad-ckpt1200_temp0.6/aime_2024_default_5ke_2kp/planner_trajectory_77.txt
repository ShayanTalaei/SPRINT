<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: first, their sum is 300, and second, the expression a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b equals 6,000,000. Hmm, let me start by understanding both equations and see how they relate.

<prompt_1.1> Analyze the problem statement and conditions to understand what needs to be found and how to relate the given equations. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
First, the equation a + b + c = 300 is straightforward. The second equation is a bit more complex. Let me write it out again to see if I can factor or simplify it somehow. The expression is a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. Let me group terms:

a²b + a²c = a²(b + c)
Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c)
And c²a + c²b = c²(a + b)

So the entire expression can be written as a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b). That's a bit simpler. Now, since a + b + c = 300, maybe I can substitute that into the expression. Let's see:

For example, b + c = 300 - a, a + c = 300 - b, and a + b = 300 - c. So substituting these into the expression:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c)

So the second equation becomes:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000
</execution_1.1>
</Execution_1>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Okay, so now the problem reduces to finding nonnegative integers a, b, c such that a + b + c = 300 and the above equation holds. Hmm, maybe I can express this in terms of variables and try to find some symmetry or possible values.

<prompt_2.1> Consider possible values for a, b, c that satisfy the sum condition and analyze the second equation for these values. </prompt_2.1>

Let me check another case. Suppose two variables are zero. Suppose a = 0, b = 0, then c = 300.

<prompt_2.2> Analyze the case where two variables are zero and verify if the second condition holds. </prompt_2.2>
-----

Another check: Let's take a = 100, b = 100, c = 100. Then a + b + c = 300. Let's compute the expression:

<prompt_2.3> Check if the case where a = b = c = 100 satisfies the second condition. </prompt_2.3>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Let me see if there's a way to relate this to the first equation. Maybe using the identity that relates sums of squares and products. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the expression a²(300 - a) as a function of a. Let me denote f(a) = a²(300 - a). Then the equation becomes f(a) + f(b) + f(c) = 6,000,000. So if I can understand the function f(a), maybe I can find possible values of a, b, c.

Let me analyze f(a). It's a cubic function in terms of a. Let's see its behavior. For a = 0, f(a) = 0. For a = 300, f(a) = 0. The maximum of this function occurs somewhere between 0 and 300. Let's find the derivative to find the maximum.

But since we are dealing with integers, maybe the maximum is around a = 200? Let me check.

Wait, f(a) = a²(300 - a). Let's take the derivative with respect to a (treating a as a real variable):

f'(a) = 2a(300 - a) + a²(-1) = 2a(300 - a) - a² = 600a - 2a² - a² = 600a - 3a²

Setting f'(a) = 0:

600a - 3a² = 0 => 3a(200 - a) = 0 => a = 0 or a = 200.

So the maximum occurs at a = 200. Therefore, the maximum value of f(a) is f(200) = 200² * 100 = 40,000 * 100 = 4,000,000.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Then the second equation becomes 0²*0 + 0²*300 + 0²*300 + 0²*0 + 300²*0 + 300²*0 = 0. Not 6,000,000. So that doesn't work. Similarly, if two variables are zero, the expression is zero. So that's not helpful.

What if one variable is zero? Let's say c = 0, then a + b = 300. The second equation becomes a²b + a²*0 + b²a + b²*0 + 0²a + 0²b = a²b + b²a = ab(a + b) = ab*300. So ab*300 = 6,000,000. Then ab = 6,000,000 / 300 = 20,000. So we need to find the number of nonnegative integer solutions (a, b) with a + b = 300 and ab = 20,000.

But wait, a and b are nonnegative integers, so a and b are integers between 0 and 300. Let me check if this is possible. Let's set a + b = 300 and ab = 20,000. Let me solve for a and b. The quadratic equation is x² - 300x + 20,000 = 0. The discriminant is 90,000 - 80,000 = 10,000. The roots are (300 ± 100)/2, so 200 and 100. So a = 200, b = 100 or a = 100, b = 200. So there are two solutions in this case. So when c = 0, there are two triples: (200, 100, 0) and (100, 200, 0). Similarly, if a = 0, then we have b + c = 300 and bc*300 = 6,000,000. So bc = 20,000. Same as above, leading to b = 200, c = 100 or b = 100, c = 200. So two triples: (0, 200, 100) and (0, 100, 200). Similarly, if b = 0, then a + c = 300 and ac*300 = 6,000,000, so ac = 20,000. Solutions a = 200, c = 100 or a = 100, c = 200. So triples (200, 0, 100) and (100, 0, 200). So in total, when one variable is zero, there are 6 triples. So that's 6 solutions. But wait, each case (c=0, a=0, b=0) gives 2 triples each, so 2*3 = 6. So total 6 solutions so far.

But wait, maybe there are more solutions where none of the variables are zero.
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
Each term is 100² * 100 = 1,000,000. There are six terms, so total is 6,000,000. So that works.
</execution_2.3>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
So the maximum possible value for each term f(a), f(b), f(c) is 4,000,000. But the total sum is 6,000,000, which is 1.5 times the maximum of each term. Since each term can be at most 4,000,000, but the sum is 6,000,000, so each term must be close to the maximum.

<prompt_3.1> Use the maximum value of the function f(a) to reason about the possible values of a, b, c and their sum. </prompt_3.1>

But wait, if two variables are 200, let's see:

<prompt_3.2> Test the cases where two variables are 200 and check if the second condition holds. </prompt_3.2>
-----

Based on execution_2.2:
So 6 solutions. But let me check if these are distinct. For example, (200, 100, 0) is different from (200, 0, 100), etc. So yes, all are distinct. So 6 solutions.

Now, are there other solutions where none of the variables are zero? Let's check.

Suppose a, b, c ≥ 1. Then, we need to find triples where a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Maybe the case where two variables are 200 and one is 100. Let's check.

<prompt_3.3> Check if the cases where two variables are 200 and one is 100 satisfy the second condition. </prompt_3.3>
-----

Based on execution_2.3:
Let me verify this. If a = 100, then f(a) = 100²*(300 - 100) = 10,000 * 200 = 2,000,000. Similarly for b and c. So 2,000,000 * 3 = 6,000,000. Correct. So that's a valid solution.

Now, what if two variables are 100 and one is 100? Wait, that's the same as all three being 100. So that's covered.

<prompt_3.4> Check if other combinations of a, b, c could satisfy the second condition and verify the total number of solutions. </prompt_3.4>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
But since they are summed, maybe two variables are 200 and one is 100? Wait, 200 + 200 + 100 = 500, which is more than 300. So that's not possible. Wait, but a + b + c = 300. So if two variables are 200, the third would be -200, which is impossible. So that can't happen.

Wait, but the maximum for each term is 4,000,000, but when a = 200, then 300 - a = 100, so f(a) = 200² * 100 = 4,000,000. Similarly for b and c. So if all three variables are 100, then each term is 100² * 200 = 2,000,000, so total 6,000,000. So that's the case where a = b = c = 100.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
Suppose a = 200, b = 200, then c = 300 - 400 = -100, which is invalid. So no. So maybe one variable is 200, and the other two sum to 100. Let's check. Suppose a = 200, then b + c = 100. Then the second equation becomes:

f(200) + f(b) + f(c) = 4,000,000 + f(b) + f(c) = 6,000,000 => f(b) + f(c) = 2,000,000.

But b + c = 100, so c = 100 - b. Then f(b) + f(100 - b) = b²(100 - b) + (100 - b)²b = b²(100 - b) + (100 - b)²b = b(100 - b)(b + (100 - b)) = b(100 - b)(100) = 100b(100 - b)

So 100b(100 - b) = 2,000,000 => b(100 - b) = 20,000.

So solving b(100 - b) = 20,000. That is, -b² + 100b - 20,000 = 0 => b² - 100b + 20,000 = 0. The discriminant is 10,000 - 80,000 = -70,000. Negative. So no real solutions. Therefore, no integer solutions in this case. So if a = 200, there are no solutions for b and c. Similarly, if any variable is 200, the other two variables would need to satisfy b(100 - b) = 20,000, which is impossible. Therefore, there are no solutions where any variable is 200.
</execution_3.2>

<execution_3.3>
Suppose a = 200, b = 200, c = 100. Then a + b + c = 500, which is more than 300. So not allowed. Wait, no, the sum is 300. So if two variables are 200, the third must be 300 - 400 = -100, which is invalid. So that's not possible. So all variables must be nonnegative, so if two variables are 200, the third must be 300 - 200 - 200 = -100, which is impossible. Therefore, no two variables can be 200. So the maximum any variable can be is 200, but if one variable is 200, the others must sum to 100. Wait, but the maximum value of a variable is 200, but if we have a = 200, then b + c = 100. Let's see what the second equation becomes.

If a = 200, then:

f(a) = 200² * (300 - 200) = 40,000 * 100 = 4,000,000

Then, f(b) + f(c) = 6,000,000 - 4,000,000 = 2,000,000

But since b + c = 100, and b, c are nonnegative integers. Let's denote b = x, c = 100 - x, where x is from 0 to 100.

Then f(b) + f(c) = x²(300 - x) + (100 - x)²(300 - (100 - x)) = x²(300 - x) + (100 - x)²(200 + x)

Let me compute this for x from 0 to 100 and see if it equals 2,000,000.

But this seems tedious. Maybe we can find x such that x²(300 - x) + (100 - x)^2(200 + x) = 2,000,000.

Alternatively, maybe there's a specific x where this holds. Let's try x = 100:

Then f(b) + f(c) = 100² * 200 + 0² * 300 = 1,000,000 * 200 = 200,000,000. That's way too big.

x = 0: f(b) + f(c) = 0 + 100² * 300 = 10,000 * 300 = 3,000,000. Still too big.

Wait, but we need this sum to be 2,000,000. So perhaps somewhere in between.

Let me try x = 50:

f(b) = 50² * 250 = 2,500 * 250 = 625,000

f(c) = 50² * 250 = same as above. So total 1,250,000. Still less than 2,000,000.

x = 60:

f(b) = 60² * 240 = 3,600 * 240 = 864,000

f(c) = 40² * 260 = 1,600 * 260 = 416,000

Total: 864,000 + 416,000 = 1,280,000. Still less.

x = 70:

f(b) = 70² * 230 = 4,900 * 230 = 1,127,000

f(c) = 30² * 270 = 900 * 270 = 243,000

Total: 1,127,000 + 243,000 = 1,370,000. Still less.

x = 80:

f(b) = 80² * 220 = 6,400 * 220 = 1,408,000

f(c) = 20² * 280 = 400 * 280 = 112,000

Total: 1,408,000 + 112,000 = 1,520,000. Closer.

x = 85:

f(b) = 85² * 215 = 7,225 * 215. Let's compute 7,225 * 200 = 1,445,000 and 7,225 * 15 = 108,375. Total 1,553,375.

f(c) = 15² * 285 = 225 * 285. 225*200=45,000; 225*85=19,125. Total 64,125.

Total: 1,553,375 + 64,125 = 1,617,500. Still less than 2,000,000.

x = 90:

f(b) = 90² * 210 = 8,100 * 210 = 1,701,000

f(c) = 10² * 290 = 100 * 290 = 29,000

Total: 1,701,000 + 29,000 = 1,730,000. Still less.

x = 95:

f(b) = 95² * 205 = 9,025 * 205. Let's compute 9,025*200=1,805,000 and 9,025*5=45,125. Total 1,850,125.

f(c) = 5² * 305 = 25 * 305 = 7,625.

Total: 1,850,125 + 7,625 = 1,857,750. Still less than 2,000,000.

x = 100: already checked, 3,000,000.

Hmm, seems like even when a = 200, the maximum total of f(b) + f(c) is 3,000,000 when b = 100, c = 0, but that gives 1,000,000 * 200 = 200,000,000? Wait, no, wait. Wait, when a = 200, and b + c = 100. If b = 100, c = 0, then f(b) = 100² * 200 = 10,000 * 200 = 2,000,000, and f(c) = 0. So total is 2,000,000. Oh! That's exactly the required value. Wait, so if a = 200, b = 100, c = 0, then f(a) + f(b) + f(c) = 4,000,000 + 2,000,000 + 0 = 6,000,000. Which matches the required total.
</execution_3.3>

<execution_3.4>
Alternatively, suppose two variables are 200 and one is 100. Let's check if that satisfies the second equation.

Take a = 200, b = 200, c = 100. Then, let's compute the expression:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b

First term: 200² * 200 = 40,000 * 200 = 8,000,000
Second term: 200² * 100 = 40,000 * 100 = 4,000,000
Third term: 200² * 200 = 8,000,000
Fourth term: 200² * 100 = 4,000,000
Fifth term: 100² * 200 = 10,000 * 200 = 2,000,000
Sixth term: 100² * 200 = 10,000 * 200 = 2,000,000

Adding all these up: 8,000,000 + 4,000,000 + 8,000,000 + 4,000,000 + 2,000,000 + 2,000,000 = 28,000,000. Which is way more than 6,000,000. So that's not acceptable. So that's invalid. So if two variables are 200 and one is 100, the sum exceeds 6,000,000. So that's not a solution.

Alternatively, maybe one variable is 200, another is 100, and the third is 100. Wait, that's the same as above. So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe one variable is 200, another is 100, and the third is 100. Wait, same as above. Let's try another combination.

Suppose one variable is 200, another is 150, and the third is 50. Let's check if that works.

a = 200, b = 150, c = 50.

Compute f(a) = 200²*(300 - 200) = 40,000*100 = 4,000,000

f(b) = 150²*(300 - 150) = 22,500*150 = 3,375,000

f(c) = 50²*(300 - 50) = 2,500*250 = 625,000

Total sum: 4,000,000 + 3,375,000 + 625,000 = 8,000,000. Still too big.

Hmm. Maybe if two variables are 150 and one is 90? Let's try a = 150, b = 150, c = 90.

f(a) = 150²*150 = 22,500*150 = 3,375,000

f(b) same as a: 3,375,000

f(c) = 90²*210 = 8,100*210 = 1,701,000

Total: 3,375,000 + 3,375,000 + 1,701,000 = 8,451,000. Still too big.

Wait, maybe if we have two variables at 100 and one at 100. Wait, that's the all 100s case, which works. What about other distributions?

Alternatively, suppose one variable is 200, another is 100, and the third is 100. Wait, that's the case we already considered. So that gives 6,000,000.

Wait, but when we tried two 200s and one 100, the total was 28 million, which is way over. So that's invalid. So maybe only the case where all three variables are 100, and the cases where one variable is zero and the other two are 200 and 100, give valid solutions. But when one variable is zero, we get 6 solutions, and when all three are 100, we get 1 solution. Wait, but the all 100s case is one solution, but the permutations of (200, 100, 0) give 6 solutions. Wait, but in the case where one variable is zero, we have (200, 100, 0), (100, 200, 0), (0, 200, 100), (0, 100, 200), (200, 0, 100), (100, 0, 200). So 6 solutions. Then the all 100s case is (100, 100, 100), which is one solution. So total solutions so far: 7.

But wait, are there any other solutions where none of the variables are zero? For example, maybe two variables are 150 and one is 0. Wait, but that's the case we considered earlier, which gives 28 million, which is too big. So no.

Alternatively, maybe one variable is 200, another is 100, and the third is 100. Wait, that's the same as the all 100s case. Wait, no. Wait, a = 200, b = 100, c = 100. Then a + b + c = 200 + 100 + 100 = 400, which is more than 300. Wait, no, that's not allowed. So that's invalid. So we can't have two 100s and a 200 because their sum would be 400, which exceeds 300. So that's not possible.

Wait, so if a = 200, then b + c = 100. If b = 100, then c = 0. So that's the case where one variable is zero. So that's already covered in the previous case. So any other combination where a = 200 and b + c = 100 would require either b or c to be zero, which would lead to the same solutions as before.

Alternatively, maybe other values. Let's suppose a = 150, then b + c = 150. Let's see if there's a possible b and c such that the total expression is 6,000,000.

But this seems complicated. Let me think of another approach.

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1, execution_3.2, execution_3.3, execution_3.4:
But wait, let's verify this. Suppose a = 100, b = 100, c = 100. Then, the expression is 100²*200 * 3 = 2,000,000 * 3 = 6,000,000. Correct.

Another possible case: maybe two variables are 100 and one is 100, but that's the same as the above.

Alternatively, if we have a = 200, b = 100, c = 0, which we already considered. So that's covered.

Alternatively, maybe another case where two variables are 100 and the third is 100. But that's the same as all three being 100.

Wait, but let's check if there are other solutions. Suppose one variable is 200, another is 100, and the third is 100. But that would require 200 + 100 + 100 = 400, which is more than 300. So that's invalid.

Alternatively, suppose one variable is 150, another is 150, and the third is 0. Then a + b + c = 150 + 150 + 0 = 300. Then compute the expression:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b

= 150²*150 + 150²*0 + 150²*150 + 150²*0 + 0²*150 + 0²*150

= 2*(150²*150) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 2*(3,375,000) = 6,750,000. Which is more than 6,000,000. So not acceptable.

Alternatively, suppose a = 150, b = 100, c = 50. Then a + b + c = 300. Compute the expression:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b

= 150²*100 + 150²*50 + 100²*150 + 100²*50 + 50²*150 + 50²*100

= 22,500*100 + 22,500*50 + 10,000*150 + 10,000*50 + 2,500*150 + 2,500*100

= 2,250,000 + 1,125,000 + 1,500,000 + 500,000 + 375,000 + 250,000

= 2,250,000 + 1,125,000 = 3,375,000

3,375,000 + 1,500,000 = 4,875,000

4,875,000 + 500,000 = 5,375,000

5,375,000 + 375,000 = 5,750,000

5,750,000 + 250,000 = 6,000,000.

Wait, that's exactly 6,000,000! So this is another solution: (150, 100, 50). But wait, this is a case where none of the variables are zero. So this is a new solution. But how did I get here? Because I tested a case where a = 150, b = 100, c = 50. Let me verify the sum: 150 + 100 + 50 = 300. Correct. And the expression equals 6,000,000. So this is another valid solution.
