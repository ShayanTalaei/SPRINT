<Question>
Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.
</Question>

<think>
<Plan_1>
Okay, let's try to solve this problem. So, we have 900 residents in Aimeville, and each of them owns at least one of four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, or a bag of candy hearts. The numbers given are:

- Diamond ring owners: 195
- Golf clubs owners: 367
- Garden spades owners: 562

All residents own candy hearts, so that's 900. Then, we're told that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. We need to find how many own all four.

Hmm, this seems like a problem that involves the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let me recall how that works.

<prompt_1.1> Based on the above plan, recall and explain the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets, and write down the formula for the total number of elements in the union of four sets. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
For four sets A, B, C, D, the formula for the union is:

|A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |A ∩ D| - |B ∩ C| - |B ∩ D| - |C ∩ D| + |A ∩ B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ D| + |A ∩ C ∩ D| + |B ∩ C ∩ D| - |A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D|

But here, we know the total number of residents is 900, and each resident owns at least one item. So the union is 900. But we don't know the individual intersections or the triple intersections. However, we do know the numbers of people who own exactly two or exactly three items. Maybe we can use that to find the number who own all four.

Wait, the problem gives us the number of people who own exactly two or three items. Let me think about how to relate that to the inclusion-exclusion formula.
</execution_1.1>
</Execution_1>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
First, let's recall that when we talk about people owning exactly two items, that means they are in exactly two of the four sets but not in any intersection of three or four sets. Similarly, exactly three means they are in exactly three sets but not in the four-way intersection.

Let me denote:

<prompt_2.1> Using the above plan, define variables for the number of people owning exactly two or three items, and express the total number of residents in terms of these variables. </prompt_2.1>

Based on execution_1.1, execution_2.1:
But we need to relate this to the inclusion-exclusion formula. Let me try to express the inclusion-exclusion formula in terms of the numbers given.

<prompt_2.2> Following the above plan, express the inclusion-exclusion formula in terms of exactly two, exactly three, and all four item owners, and write the equation relating these quantities to the total population. </prompt_2.2>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Let me denote:

- Let x be the number of people who own exactly two items.
- Let y be the number of people who own exactly three items.
- Let z be the number of people who own all four items.

But we are given x = 437 and y = 234. We need to find z.

But how does this relate to the inclusion-exclusion formula? Let's see.

The inclusion-exclusion formula for four sets counts all the single sets, subtracts all the pairwise intersections, adds back the triple intersections, and subtracts the fourfold intersection. But in our case, we are given the counts of people owning exactly two or exactly three items. So maybe we can express the inclusion-exclusion formula in terms of these exact counts.

Wait, perhaps we can break down the inclusion-exclusion formula into parts. Let's consider the total number of people as the sum of those owning exactly one, exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four items. Since each person owns at least one item, the total is:

Total = (exactly one) + (exactly two) + (exactly three) + (exactly four)

We know the total is 900, and we know exactly two and exactly three. So if we can find the number of people owning exactly one and exactly four, we can check, but we don't have the exactly one or exactly four numbers. However, maybe we can relate the inclusion-exclusion formula to these exact numbers.

Alternatively, let's recall that the inclusion-exclusion formula can also be written in terms of the number of people owning exactly each number of items. Let me think.

For four sets, the inclusion-exclusion formula can be expressed as:

Total = (sum of individual sets) - (sum of pairwise intersections) + (sum of triple intersections) - (fourfold intersection)

But the sum of pairwise intersections includes people who are in exactly two sets, but it also includes those in exactly three or four. Similarly, the sum of triple intersections includes those in exactly three and four. The fourfold intersection is just z.

But maybe we can express the sum of pairwise intersections as the number of people in exactly two sets plus 3 times the number of people in exactly three sets plus 6 times the number of people in all four sets. Wait, why?
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
The inclusion-exclusion formula can be broken down into sums of individual sets, subtract sums of pairwise intersections, add sums of triple intersections, and subtract the four-way intersection.

But the numbers given (exactly two, exactly three) correspond to the counts in the inclusion-exclusion terms. Let me recall that the number of people in exactly two sets is equal to the sum of all pairwise intersections minus three times the four-way intersection. Wait, no. Let me think.

Each pairwise intersection |A ∩ B| includes those who are in exactly A and B, plus those who are in A, B, and possibly C or D. Similarly, the number of people in exactly two sets is equal to the sum of all pairwise intersections minus 3 times the four-way intersection? Hmm, maybe not. Let's see.

Actually, the number of people in exactly two sets can be calculated by taking each pairwise intersection and subtracting those who are in three or four sets. But since we don't have the counts for three or four sets, maybe we need another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that the total number of people is equal to the sum of people in exactly one, exactly two, exactly three, exactly four sets. Since everyone owns at least one item, the total is 900. So:

Total = Exactly one + Exactly two + Exactly three + Exactly four = 900

We are given Exactly two = 437, Exactly three = 234. Let’s denote Exactly four as x. Then:

Exactly one = 900 - 437 - 234 - x = 900 - 671 - x = 229 - x

But we need to find x. To do that, we need to relate the given numbers to the inclusion-exclusion formula.

Let me recall that in inclusion-exclusion, the sum of all pairwise intersections (which is |A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |A ∩ D| + |B ∩ C| + |B ∩ D| + |C ∩ D|) equals the sum of exactly two sets plus three times the exactly three sets plus six times the exactly four set. Wait, maybe not.

Wait, each pairwise intersection includes those who are in exactly two sets plus those in exactly three sets that include that pair plus those in all four sets. So, for example, |A ∩ B| = exactly two (A and B) + exactly three (A, B, C) + exactly three (A, B, D) + exactly four (A, B, C, D). Similarly, each pairwise intersection is equal to the number of people in exactly two sets that are in this pair, plus the number in exactly three sets that include this pair, plus the number in all four sets.

But since we don't know the individual pairwise intersections, maybe we can use the fact that the sum of all pairwise intersections can be expressed in terms of the exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four counts.

Let me denote:

Let S2 = sum of all pairwise intersections = |A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |A ∩ D| + |B ∩ C| + |B ∩ D| + |C ∩ D|

Similarly, the sum of all triple intersections T3 = |A ∩ B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ D| + |A ∩ C ∩ D| + |B ∩ C ∩ D|

And the four-way intersection T4 = |A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D|

In inclusion-exclusion, the formula is:

Total = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - S2 + T3 - T4

But we also know that:

Total = Exactly one + Exactly two + Exactly three + Exactly four

Which gives:

900 = Exactly one + 437 + 234 + x

So Exactly one = 900 - 437 - 234 - x = 229 - x

But we need another equation to relate these variables. Let's express S2 and T3 in terms of the exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four.

For each pairwise intersection |A ∩ B|, it includes:

- Exactly two people who own only A and B (let's call this E2(AB))

- Exactly three people who own A, B, and one more (say C or D), which is E3(ABC) and E3(ABD)

- Exactly four people who own all four, E4

So, |A ∩ B| = E2(AB) + E3(ABC) + E3(ABD) + E4

Similarly, each pairwise intersection is equal to the number of exactly two in that pair plus the exactly three in that pair plus the exactly four.

Therefore, the sum of all pairwise intersections S2 is equal to the sum over all pairs of E2(pairs) + sum over all triples of E3(triples) + 6 * E4 (since each exactly four person is in all six pairwise intersections)

Wait, because each person in exactly four is counted in all six pairwise intersections. So, for E4, each contributes 6 to S2. Similarly, each person in exactly three is in three pairwise intersections. For example, a person in exactly three (say A, B, C) is in the intersections AB, AC, BC. So, E3(triples) contributes 3 per person. And exactly two contributes 1 per person.

Therefore:

S2 = sum of E2(pairs) + 3 * sum of E3(triples) + 6 * E4

But we know sum of E2(pairs) is 437 (given exactly two). Wait, no. Wait, sum of E2(pairs) is the total number of people who are in exactly two sets, which is 437. But each exactly two person is in exactly one pair. So sum of E2(pairs) = 437. Similarly, each exactly three person is in three pairs, so sum of E3(triples) = 234, but each person is in three pairs, so sum of E3(pairs) = 234 * 3 = 702. Similarly, exactly four people are in six pairs, so sum of E4(pairs) = x * 6.

Therefore, S2 = 437 + 702 + 6x = 1139 + 6x

Similarly, the sum of all triple intersections T3 is equal to the number of exactly three people. Because each exactly three person is in exactly one triple intersection. So sum of E3(triples) = 234. But wait, no. Each exactly three person is in three triple intersections? Wait, no. Wait, each exactly three person is in one triple intersection. For example, a person in exactly three sets A, B, C is in the intersection A ∩ B ∩ C. So, each exactly three person is in exactly one triple intersection. Therefore, the sum of E3(triples) is equal to the number of exactly three people, which is 234. Wait, but in the inclusion-exclusion formula, T3 is the sum of all triple intersections, which is exactly equal to the number of exactly three people. Because each triple intersection includes all exactly three people who are in that triple. However, if there are people in more than three sets, they would be counted in multiple triple intersections. Wait, but since we are considering exactly three people, they are only in one triple intersection. Wait, no. Wait, if someone is in exactly three sets, they are in exactly one triple intersection. For example, if someone is in A, B, C but not D, then they are in A ∩ B ∩ C but not in any other triple intersection. Similarly, someone in exactly three sets is in exactly one triple intersection. Therefore, the sum of E3(triples) is equal to the number of exactly three people, which is 234. Therefore, T3 = 234

Wait, but in inclusion-exclusion, T3 is the sum of all triple intersections. Each triple intersection includes all people who are in exactly those three sets plus those who are in all four. So, T3 = sum of exactly three people + 4 * exactly four people. Because each triple intersection includes the exactly three people in that triple and the exactly four people who are in all four. Since there are four triple intersections (ABC, ABD, ACD, BCD), each exactly four person is in all four triple intersections. Therefore, T3 = 234 + 4x

But earlier, we thought that sum of E3(triples) = 234, but actually, in the inclusion-exclusion formula, T3 is the sum over all triples of their intersections. Each triple intersection includes exactly three people (those in exactly those three sets) plus exactly four people (those in all four). Therefore, T3 = 234 + 4x

But wait, the sum of all triple intersections is the sum over all four possible triples. Each triple intersection is |A ∩ B ∩ C|, |A ∩ B ∩ D|, |A ∩ C ∩ D|, |B ∩ C ∩ D|. Each of these is equal to the number of exactly three people in that triple plus the number of exactly four people. Since each triple intersection includes those exactly three in that triple and exactly four. So, each triple intersection has E3(triple) + E4. So, the sum of all triple intersections is sum(E3(triple)) + 4 * E4. But sum(E3(triple)) is 234 (since each exactly three person is in exactly one triple intersection). Therefore, T3 = 234 + 4x

So, going back, T3 = 234 + 4x

We had earlier that:

Inclusion-exclusion formula:

Total = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - S2 + T3 - T4

Which is:

900 = 195 + 367 + 562 - S2 + T3 - x

We already have S2 = 1139 + 6x and T3 = 234 + 4x. Let's substitute these into the equation.
</execution_2.2>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.2:
Plugging in:

<prompt_3.1> Following the above plan, substitute S2 and T3 into the inclusion-exclusion formula and solve the resulting equation for x. </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
900 = 195 + 367 + 562 - (1139 + 6x) + (234 + 4x) - x

Let's compute the left side and the right side step by step.

First, compute the sum of the individual sets:

195 + 367 + 562 = 195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124

So, 1124

Then, subtract S2: 1124 - (1139 + 6x) = 1124 - 1139 - 6x = -15 - 6x

Then, add T3: -15 - 6x + (234 + 4x) = (-15 + 234) + (-6x + 4x) = 219 - 2x

Then, subtract T4 (which is x): 219 - 2x - x = 219 - 3x

So, the equation becomes:

900 = 219 - 3x

Solving for x:

900 - 219 = -3x

681 = -3x

x = 681 / (-3) = -227

Wait, that can't be right. A negative number of people? That doesn't make sense. So, there must be a mistake in the calculations.

Let me check the steps again.
</execution_3.1>
</Execution_3>

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
First, the sum of individual sets: 195 + 367 + 562.

<prompt_4.1> Based on the above plan, recalculate the sum of individual sets, verify the expression for S2, check the inclusion-exclusion formula, and confirm the solution for x. </prompt_4.1>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
Let's compute that again: 195 + 367. 195 + 300 = 495, 495 + 67 = 562. Then 562 + 562. 562 + 500 = 1062, 1062 + 62 = 1124. Correct.

Then, S2 = 1139 + 6x. Let me verify that. S2 was calculated as 437 + 702 + 6x. 437 + 702 is indeed 1139, so S2 = 1139 + 6x. Correct.

T3 = 234 + 4x. That's because each triple intersection has exactly three people (234 total) plus exactly four people (x each, but there are four triple intersections, so 4x). Correct.

So, substituting into inclusion-exclusion:

900 = 1124 - (1139 + 6x) + (234 + 4x) - x

Compute step by step:

1124 - 1139 = -15

-15 - 6x + 234 + 4x = (-15 + 234) + (-6x + 4x) = 219 - 2x

Then subtract x: 219 - 2x - x = 219 - 3x

So, 900 = 219 - 3x

Then, 900 - 219 = -3x

681 = -3x

x = -681 / 3 = -227

Negative number? That can't be. So, there must be a mistake in the logic somewhere.
</execution_4.1>
</Execution_4>

<Plan_5>
Based on execution_4.1:
Let's go back and check each step.

First, the inclusion-exclusion formula:

<prompt_5.1> Following the above plan, carefully recheck the inclusion-exclusion formula, the calculation of S2 and T3, and verify the algebraic steps to identify the error. </prompt_5.1>
</Plan_5>

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
Total = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |A ∩ D| - |B ∩ C| - |B ∩ D| - |C ∩ D| + |A ∩ B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ D| + |A ∩ C ∩ D| + |B ∩ C ∩ D| - |A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D|

Yes, that's correct.

Then, we said that S2 = sum of pairwise intersections = sum of E2(pairs) + 3*sum of E3(triples) + 6*E4. Wait, but let's verify that.

Each exactly two person contributes 1 to each pairwise intersection they are in. Since they are in exactly one pair, they contribute 1 to S2. Each exactly three person is in three pairwise intersections, so contributes 3 to S2. Each exactly four person is in six pairwise intersections, contributing 6 to S2. Therefore:

S2 = E2 + 3*E3 + 6*E4

Which is 437 + 3*234 + 6x = 437 + 702 + 6x = 1139 + 6x. That's correct.

Then, T3 = sum of triple intersections = E3 + 4*E4, because each exactly three person is in exactly one triple intersection, and each exactly four person is in all four triple intersections. Therefore, T3 = E3 + 4E4 = 234 + 4x. Correct.

Therefore, plugging into inclusion-exclusion:

900 = 195 + 367 + 562 - S2 + T3 - E4

Wait, hold on! Wait, in the inclusion-exclusion formula, the last term is - |A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D|, which is E4. So the formula is:

Total = sum A - sum pairwise + sum triple - sum four

So, 900 = 1124 - S2 + T3 - x

So, substituting S2 = 1139 + 6x and T3 = 234 + 4x:

900 = 1124 - (1139 + 6x) + (234 + 4x) - x

Compute step by step:

1124 - 1139 = -15

-15 - 6x + 234 + 4x = (-15 + 234) + (-6x + 4x) = 219 - 2x

Then, subtract x: 219 - 2x - x = 219 - 3x

So, 900 = 219 - 3x

Then, 900 - 219 = -3x => 681 = -3x => x = -227
</execution_5.1>
</Execution_5>

<Plan_6>
Based on execution_5.1:
Hmm, that's impossible. There must be a mistake in the initial approach.

Alternative approach: Let's use the principle of inclusion-exclusion but express the formula in terms of the given numbers.

We can use the formula for the union of four sets:

<prompt_6.1> Following the above plan, describe the alternative approach and restate the inclusion-exclusion formula. </prompt_6.1>

We know that:

Total = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - (sum of |A ∩ B|) + (sum of |A ∩ B ∩ C|) - |A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D|

<prompt_6.2> Following the above plan, express the sum of pairwise intersections and triple intersections in terms of exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four items, then substitute into the inclusion-exclusion formula and solve for x. </prompt_6.2>
</Plan_6>

<Execution_6>
<execution_6.1>
|A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |A ∩ D| - |B ∩ C| - |B ∩ D| - |C ∩ D| + |A ∩ B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ D| + |A ∩ C ∩ D| + |B ∩ C ∩ D| - |A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D|

But we don't know the individual pairwise and triple intersections. However, we know the number of people who own exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four items. Let's denote:

Let x be the number of people owning exactly four items.

Let y be the number of people owning exactly three items: y = 234

Let z be the number of people owning exactly two items: z = 437

Let w be the number of people owning exactly one item. Then total = w + y + z + x = 900 => w = 900 - 234 - 437 - x = 900 - 671 - x = 229 - x

But how does this relate to the inclusion-exclusion formula?

Inclusion-exclusion formula can also be written in terms of the exact counts. Let me recall that the inclusion-exclusion formula can be expressed as:

Total = (sum of individual sets) - (sum of pairwise intersections) + (sum of triple intersections) - (sum of four-way intersections)

But we can also express the sum of pairwise intersections in terms of the exact counts. Each pairwise intersection |A ∩ B| includes people who own exactly two items (A and B), exactly three items (A, B, and one more), and exactly four items (all four). Similarly for other intersections.

So, for example:

|A ∩ B| = number of people who own exactly A and B + number who own exactly A, B, and C + number who own exactly A, B, and D + number who own all four.

Similarly for all other pairwise intersections.

Therefore, the sum of all pairwise intersections S2 can be expressed as:

S2 = sum over all pairs of (number of exactly two in that pair + number of exactly three in that pair + number of exactly four)

But since each exactly two person is in exactly one pair, the sum of exactly two people over all pairs is z = 437. Each exactly three person is in three pairs, so their contribution to S2 is 3*y = 3*234 = 702. Each exactly four person is in six pairs, so their contribution is 6*x.

Therefore, S2 = z + 3*y + 6*x = 437 + 702 + 6x = 1139 + 6x

Similarly, the sum of triple intersections T3 can be expressed as:

Each triple intersection |A ∩ B ∩ C| includes people who own exactly A, B, C (which is part of y = 234) and people who own all four (which is x). However, each exactly three person is in exactly one triple intersection, so the sum of exactly three people over all triples is y = 234. Each exactly four person is in four triple intersections, so their contribution is 4*x.

Therefore, T3 = y + 4*x = 234 + 4x

The four-way intersection is just x.

Therefore, substituting into the inclusion-exclusion formula:

Total = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - S2 + T3 - x

Which gives:

900 = 195 + 367 + 562 - (1139 + 6x) + (234 + 4x) - x

Simplify the right-hand side:

First, compute 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124

Then, subtract S2: 1124 - (1139 + 6x) = 1124 - 1139 - 6x = -15 - 6x

Add T3: -15 - 6x + 234 + 4x = ( -15 + 234 ) + ( -6x + 4x ) = 219 - 2x

Subtract x: 219 - 2x - x = 219 - 3x

Thus, the equation is:

900 = 219 - 3x

Subtract 219 from both sides:

900 - 219 = -3x => 681 = -3x => x = -227

Wait, that's impossible. There must be a mistake here. How can the number of people owning all four items be negative?

This suggests that there's an error in the reasoning.
</execution_6.1>

<execution_6.2>
But we don't know the sum of the pairwise intersections or the sum of the triple intersections. However, we do know the number of people in exactly two or exactly three sets.

Let me denote:

Let’s denote the number of people in exactly two sets as E2 = 437, exactly three as E3 = 234, and exactly four as E4 = x. Then, the total number of people is E1 + E2 + E3 + E4 = 900. Therefore, E1 = 900 - E2 - E3 - E4 = 900 - 437 - 234 - x = 229 - x.

Now, we need to relate this to the sums in inclusion-exclusion.

The sum of all pairwise intersections, sum |A ∩ B|, is equal to:

sum |A ∩ B| = sum_{over all pairs} |A ∩ B|

Each pair |A ∩ B| includes:

- The number of people in exactly A and B: E2(AB)

- The number of people in exactly A, B, and one more: E3(ABC), E3(ABD), E3(ACD), E3(BCD)

- The number of people in all four: E4

Therefore, each |A ∩ B| = E2(AB) + sum over triples including AB of E3(triple) + E4

But since each exactly two person is in exactly one pair, sum of all E2(AB) over all pairs is E2 = 437.

Each exactly three person is in three pairs. For example, someone in exactly three sets A, B, C is in three pairs: AB, AC, BC. So, sum over all triples of E3(triple) = 3 * E3 = 3*234 = 702. Therefore, the sum over all pairs of the sum over triples including that pair of E3(triple) is 3*E3 = 702.

Therefore, sum |A ∩ B| = E2 + 3*E3 + 4*E4

Because each exactly four person is in six pairs, so E4 contributes 6*E4 to the sum of pairwise intersections.

So, sum |A ∩ B| = 437 + 3*234 + 6x = 437 + 702 + 6x = 1139 + 6x

Similarly, the sum of all triple intersections sum |A ∩ B ∩ C| is equal to:

Each triple intersection includes:

- The number of people in exactly A, B, C: E3(triple)

- The number of people in all four: E4

There are four triple intersections. Each exactly three person is in exactly one triple intersection, so sum of E3(triple) over all triples is E3 = 234. Each exactly four person is in all four triple intersections, so sum over all triples of E4(triple) = 4*E4

Therefore, sum |A ∩ B ∩ C| = E3 + 4*E4 = 234 + 4x

Therefore, going back to inclusion-exclusion:

Total = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - sum |A ∩ B| + sum |A ∩ B ∩ C| - sum |A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D|

So,

900 = 195 + 367 + 562 - (1139 + 6x) + (234 + 4x) - x

Let’s compute this step by step.

First, sum of individual sets: 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124

Subtract sum |A ∩ B|: 1124 - (1139 + 6x) = 1124 - 1139 - 6x = -15 - 6x

Add sum |A ∩ B ∩ C|: -15 - 6x + 234 + 4x = (-15 + 234) + (-6x + 4x) = 219 - 2x

Subtract sum |A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D|: 219 - 2x - x = 219 - 3x

Set equal to total: 219 - 3x = 900

Solving for x:

-3x = 900 - 219 = 681

x = 681 / (-3) = -227

Again, we get a negative number. This can't be right. There must be a mistake in the logic.

Based on execution_6.2:
Wait, but 229 - x must be the number of people owning exactly one item. If x is negative, then E1 would be 229 - (-227) = 456, which is possible, but the negative x suggests an inconsistency.

This must mean there's a mistake in the way we set up the equations.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of sum |A ∩ B|. Let's re-examine that.

sum |A ∩ B| over all pairs is equal to the sum over all pairs of the number of people in those pairs. Each pair's intersection includes:

- Exactly two people in that pair: E2(AB)

- Exactly three people in that pair: E3(ABC), E3(ABD), etc. Each exactly three person is in three pairs, so the total number of exactly three people across all pairs is 3*E3 = 702. But how does this relate to sum |A ∩ B|?

Each exactly three person is in three pairs, so contributes 3 to the sum |A ∩ B|. Similarly, each exactly four person is in six pairs, contributing 6. Each exactly two person is in one pair, contributing 1. Each exactly one person is in zero pairs. Therefore:

sum |A ∩ B| = sum over all pairs of |A ∩ B| = sum over all pairs of (E2(AB) + E3triple(AB) + E4)

But E2(AB) is the number of exactly two people in pair AB. The sum over all pairs of E2(AB) is equal to the total number of exactly two people, since each exactly two person is in exactly one pair. So sum E2(AB) = E2 = 437.

The sum over all pairs of E3triple(AB) is equal to 3*E3 = 702, since each exactly three person is in three pairs.

The sum over all pairs of E4 is equal to 6*E4, since each exactly four person is in six pairs.

Therefore, sum |A ∩ B| = 437 + 702 + 6x = 1139 + 6x

That part seems correct.

Then, sum |A ∩ B ∩ C| = sum over all triples of |A ∩ B ∩ C| = sum over all triples of (E3triple + E4)

Each exactly three person is in exactly one triple, so sum E3triple = E3 = 234. Each exactly four person is in all four triples, so sum E4 over triples is 4x. Therefore, sum |A ∩ B ∩ C| = 234 + 4x

Correct.

Then, inclusion-exclusion:

Total = 195 + 367 + 562 - (1139 + 6x) + (234 + 4x) - x

Compute:

195 + 367 + 562 = 1124

1124 - 1139 = -15

-15 - 6x + 234 + 4x = 219 - 2x

219 - 2x - x = 219 - 3x

Set equal to 900:

219 - 3x = 900 => -3x = 681 => x = -227

Negative result. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the assumptions or calculations.
