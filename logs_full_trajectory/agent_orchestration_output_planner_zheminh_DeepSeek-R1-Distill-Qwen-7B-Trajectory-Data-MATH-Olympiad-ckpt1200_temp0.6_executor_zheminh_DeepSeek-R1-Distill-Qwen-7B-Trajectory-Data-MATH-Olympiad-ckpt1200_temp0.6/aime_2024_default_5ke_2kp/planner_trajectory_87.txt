<Plan_1>
Alright, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking for the greatest four-digit number N with the property that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, we need to find Q and R when N is divided by 1000, where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder, and finally compute Q + R.

<prompt_1.1> Read and understand the problem statement carefully, restate the problem in your own words, and plan how to approach it. Define the four-digit number N as a=abcd, where a, b, c, d are digits, and outline the approach to find N by checking divisibility by 7 when each digit is replaced by 1. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
First, let me parse the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly.

We have a four-digit number N. For each digit in N (thousands, hundreds, tens, units), if we change that digit to 1, the new number obtained is divisible by 7. We need the greatest such N, then compute Q + R where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000.

So, N is a four-digit number, say abcd (where a, b, c, d are digits from 0-9, and a is at least 1). The conditions are:

1. Changing the thousands digit (a) to 1 gives 1bcd, which must be divisible by 7.
2. Changing the hundreds digit (b) to 1 gives a1cd, which must be divisible by 7.
3. Changing the tens digit (c) to 1 gives ab1d, which must be divisible by 7.
4. Changing the units digit (d) to 1 gives abc1, which must be divisible by 7.

We need the largest N = abcd that satisfies all four conditions.
</execution_1.1>
</Execution_1>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
To approach this, I think we need to model each condition mathematically. Let's denote the original number as N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d.

<prompt_2.1> Using the original number N = abcd, express each modified number obtained by changing each digit to 1 as a linear equation involving N and the place value of the changed digit. Then, restate the conditions for divisibility by 7 in terms of modular arithmetic. </prompt_2.1>

Starting with the thousands digit: 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

Similarly, for the hundreds digit: 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

Same for the tens digit: 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

And the units digit: 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, we have four congruences:

1. 1000a + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7 (original number, but this is not a condition, just the number itself)
2. 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d ≡ 0 mod 7
5. 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Wait, actually, the original number N is abcd, and when we change each digit to 1, we get different numbers. So the original N is not necessarily divisible by 7; only the modified numbers are.

Therefore, the four conditions are:

<prompt_2.2> Re-express the conditions for divisibility by 7 when each digit is changed to 1, and rearrange each congruence to isolate N. Then, write down the four conditions explicitly in terms of a, b, c, d. </prompt_2.2>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Similarly, changing the hundreds digit gives 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d.

Similarly for the tens and units digits.

Therefore, each of these four modified numbers must be divisible by 7. So, we can write four congruences:

1. (1000a + 100b + 10c + d) with a replaced by 1: 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
2. (1000a + 100b + 10c + d) with b replaced by 1: 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
3. (1000a + 100b + 10c + d) with c replaced by 1: 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d ≡ 0 mod 7
4. (1000a + 100b + 10c + d) with d replaced by 1: 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

So, four congruences involving a, b, c, d. Our goal is to find the largest four-digit number abcd such that all four of these congruences hold.

Since N is a four-digit number, a can be from 1 to 9, and b, c, d from 0 to 9. We need the maximum possible N, so we should try to maximize a first, then b, then c, then d. But we need to ensure that all four conditions are satisfied.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
1. Changing a to 1: 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
2. Changing b to 1: 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
3. Changing c to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d ≡ 0 mod 7
4. Changing d to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

So, these are four separate congruence conditions that N must satisfy. However, N itself is abcd, which is 1000a + 100b + 10c + d. But the original N is not necessarily divisible by 7; only the modified numbers are.

Therefore, we need to find N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, such that the four above conditions hold. Since we need the greatest such N, we can approach this by starting from the largest possible N (which is 9999) and check downwards if the conditions hold. However, this might be time-consuming, so perhaps we can find a smarter way.

Alternatively, we can express each condition in terms of N and see if we can find relationships between the digits.
</execution_2.2>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1, execution_2.2:
Let's consider each condition:

<prompt_3.1> For each condition, express the modified number in terms of N and the digit being changed, then simplify modulo 7 to find the relationship between the original number N and the digit being changed. Then, write down these simplified congruences for each digit. </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
1. Changing a to 1: 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
But N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d. Therefore, 1000 + (N - 1000a) ≡ 0 mod 7. Wait, maybe this approach complicates things. Alternatively, note that changing a to 1 is equivalent to replacing a with 1 in the thousands place. So, the modified number is 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d. Let's denote this as M1 = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d.

Similarly, M2 = 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d.

M3 = 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d.

M4 = 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1.

Each of these M1, M2, M3, M4 must be divisible by 7. So, M1 ≡ 0 mod 7, M2 ≡ 0 mod 7, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express each condition in terms of N.

Note that N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d.

Then, M1 = 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d = (1000a + 100b + 10c + d) - 1000a + 1000 = N - 1000a + 1000 = N + 1000(1 - a).

Similarly, M2 = 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d = N - 100b + 100 = N + 100(1 - b).

M3 = 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d = N - 10c + 10 = N + 10(1 - c).

M4 = 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 = N - d + 1.

Therefore, each of M1, M2, M3, M4 must be divisible by 7. Therefore:

1. N + 1000(1 - a) ≡ 0 mod 7
2. N + 100(1 - b) ≡ 0 mod 7
3. N + 10(1 - c) ≡ 0 mod 7
4. N - d + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

So, these are four congruences that N must satisfy.
</execution_3.1>
</Execution_3>

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
But since N is 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, perhaps we can relate these congruences to N modulo 7.

Alternatively, since all four congruences must hold, we can express each as:

<prompt_4.1> Using the four congruences derived earlier, compute the coefficients of N modulo 7 for each, and set up the system of congruences to be satisfied by N. Then, write down the system of four congruences that N must satisfy. </prompt_4.1>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
1. N ≡ -1000(1 - a) mod 7
2. N ≡ -100(1 - b) mod 7
3. N ≡ -10(1 - c) mod 7
4. N ≡ d - 1 mod 7

But since N is a four-digit number, perhaps we can compute the coefficients modulo 7.
</execution_4.1>
</Execution_4>

<Plan_5>
Based on execution_4.1:
First, compute 1000 mod 7.

<prompt_5.1> Compute 1000 mod 7, 100 mod 7, and 10 mod 7. Then, compute the coefficients 1000 mod 7, 100 mod 7, and 10 mod 7. </prompt_5.1>

Therefore, the four congruences become:

<prompt_5.2> Substitute the computed coefficients modulo 7 into the four congruences. Then, write down the four congruences explicitly in terms of N, a, b, c, d. </prompt_5.2>
</Plan_5>

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
1000 divided by 7 is 142*7 = 994, remainder 6. So 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

Similarly, 100 mod 7: 100 divided by 7 is 14*7=98, remainder 2. So 100 ≡ 2 mod 7.

10 mod 7 is 3, since 10 - 7 = 3.

Therefore:

1. N ≡ -6(1 - a) mod 7
2. N ≡ -2(1 - b) mod 7
3. N ≡ -3(1 - c) mod 7
4. N ≡ d - 1 mod 7

But N is 1000a + 100b + 10c + d. Let's compute N mod 7.

Since 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7, 100 ≡ 2 mod 7, 10 ≡ 3 mod 7, and 1 ≡ 1 mod 7. Therefore:

N ≡ 6a + 2b + 3c + d mod 7.

Therefore, the four congruences can be rewritten as:

1. 6a + 2b + 3c + d ≡ -6(1 - a) mod 7
2. 6a + 2b + 3c + d ≡ -2(1 - b) mod 7
3. 6a + 2b + 3c + d ≡ -3(1 - c) mod 7
4. 6a + 2b + 3c + d ≡ d - 1 mod 7

Simplify each congruence:

Starting with the first one:

1. 6a + 2b + 3c + d ≡ -6 + 6a mod 7

Subtract 6a from both sides:

2b + 3c + d ≡ -6 mod 7

Which is equivalent to:

2b + 3c + d ≡ 1 mod 7 (since -6 ≡ 1 mod 7)

Similarly, second congruence:

2. 6a + 2b + 3c + d ≡ -2 + 2b mod 7

Subtract 2b from both sides:

6a + 3c + d ≡ -2 mod 7

Which is:

6a + 3c + d ≡ 5 mod 7 (since -2 ≡ 5 mod 7)

Third congruence:

3. 6a + 2b + 3c + d ≡ -3 + 3c mod 7

Subtract 3c from both sides:

6a + 2b + d ≡ -3 mod 7

Which is:

6a + 2b + d ≡ 4 mod 7 (since -3 ≡ 4 mod 7)

Fourth congruence:

4. 6a + 2b + 3c + d ≡ d - 1 mod 7

Subtract d from both sides:

6a + 2b + 3c ≡ -1 mod 7

Which is:

6a + 2b + 3c ≡ 6 mod 7 (since -1 ≡ 6 mod 7)

So now we have four congruences:

1. 2b + 3c + d ≡ 1 mod 7
2. 6a + 3c + d ≡ 5 mod 7
3. 6a + 2b + d ≡ 4 mod 7
4. 6a + 2b + 3c ≡ 6 mod 7

These are four equations in variables a, b, c, d (each from 0-9, with a ≥ 1).
</execution_5.1>

<execution_5.2>
1. N ≡ -1000(1 - a) mod 7 ≡ -1000 mod 7 * (1 - a) mod 7

But 1000 mod 7: 7*142 = 994, so 1000 - 994 = 6, so 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7. Therefore, -1000 ≡ -6 ≡ 1 mod 7. Therefore, the first congruence becomes N ≡ 1*(1 - a) mod 7. Wait, let's check that again.

Wait, 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7, so -1000 ≡ -6 ≡ 1 mod 7. Therefore, the first congruence is N ≡ 1*(1 - a) mod 7. Similarly:

2. 100 mod 7: 7*14=98, so 100 ≡ 2 mod 7. Therefore, -100 ≡ -2 ≡ 5 mod 7. So, second congruence: N ≡ 5*(1 - b) mod 7.

3. 10 mod 7 is 3. So, -10 ≡ -3 ≡ 4 mod 7. Therefore, third congruence: N ≡ 4*(1 - c) mod 7.

4. The fourth congruence is N ≡ d - 1 mod 7.

Therefore, the four congruences are:

1. N ≡ (1 - a) mod 7
2. N ≡ 5*(1 - b) mod 7
3. N ≡ 4*(1 - c) mod 7
4. N ≡ (d - 1) mod 7

So, N must satisfy all four of these congruences simultaneously.
</execution_5.2>
</Execution_5>

<Plan_6>
Based on execution_5.2:
But N is also equal to 1000a + 100b + 10c + d.

Therefore, we can write:

<prompt_6.1> Using the four congruences derived, write down the four equations in terms of a, b, c, d. Then, note that these equations must be satisfied simultaneously to find a, b, c, d. </prompt_6.1>
</Plan_6>

<Execution_6>
<execution_6.1>
1. 1000a + 100b + 10c + d ≡ (1 - a) mod 7
2. 1000a + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 5*(1 - b) mod 7
3. 1000a + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 4*(1 - c) mod 7
4. 1000a + 100b + 10c + d ≡ d - 1 mod 7

So, these four equations must hold simultaneously. Let's rewrite these equations modulo 7.

But first, let's compute 1000a + 100b + 10c + d modulo 7.

As before, 1000 ≡ 6, 100 ≡ 2, 10 ≡ 3, 1 ≡ 1 mod 7. Therefore:

1000a + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 6a + 2b + 3c + d mod 7.

So, substituting into each equation:

1. 6a + 2b + 3c + d ≡ (1 - a) mod 7
2. 6a + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 5*(1 - b) mod 7
3. 6a + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 4*(1 - c) mod 7
4. 6a + 2b + 3c + d ≡ d - 1 mod 7

Let's simplify each equation:

Starting with equation 1:

6a + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 1 - a mod 7

Bring all terms to left side:

6a + 2b + 3c + d + a - 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

7a + 2b + 3c + d - 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

But 7a ≡ 0 mod 7, so:

2b + 3c + d - 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Thus:

2b + 3c + d ≡ 1 mod 7. (Equation 1 simplified)

Equation 2:

6a + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 5 - 5b mod 7

Bring all terms to left side:

6a + 2b + 3c + d + 5b - 5 ≡ 0 mod 7

6a + 7b + 3c + d - 5 ≡ 0 mod 7

Again, 7b ≡ 0 mod 7, so:

6a + 3c + d - 5 ≡ 0 mod 7

Thus:

6a + 3c + d ≡ 5 mod 7. (Equation 2 simplified)

Equation 3:

6a + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 4 - 4c mod 7

Bring all terms to left side:

6a + 2b + 3c + d + 4c - 4 ≡ 0 mod 7

6a + 2b + 7c + d - 4 ≡ 0 mod 7

7c ≡ 0 mod 7, so:

6a + 2b + d - 4 ≡ 0 mod 7

Thus:

6a + 2b + d ≡ 4 mod 7. (Equation 3 simplified)

Equation 4:

6a + 2b + 3c + d ≡ d - 1 mod 7

Subtract d from both sides:

6a + 2b + 3c ≡ -1 mod 7

Which is:

6a + 2b + 3c ≡ 6 mod 7. (Equation 4 simplified)

So now we have four simplified congruences:

1. 2b + 3c + d ≡ 1 mod 7
2. 6a + 3c + d ≡ 5 mod 7
3. 6a + 2b + d ≡ 4 mod 7
4. 6a + 2b + 3c ≡ 6 mod 7

So, these four equations must all hold.
</execution_6.1>
</Execution_6>

<Plan_7>
Based on execution_6.1:
Therefore, perhaps we can solve these equations step by step.

First, let's note that equations 1, 2, 3 all involve 6a, 2b, 3c, d. Let's see if we can express variables in terms of others.

Looking at equations 1, 2, 3:

<prompt_7.1> Analyze the four congruences and see if we can subtract or combine them to eliminate variables. Consider subtracting equations to eliminate variables. </prompt_7.1>
</Plan_7>

<Execution_7>
<execution_7.1>
Equation 2: 6a + 3c + d ≡ 5 mod 7

Equation 3: 6a + 2b + d ≡ 4 mod 7

Equation 1: 2b + 3c + d ≡ 1 mod 7

Let me subtract equation 1 from equation 2:

(6a + 3c + d) - (2b + 3c + d) ≡ 5 - 1 mod 7

Which simplifies to:

6a - 2b ≡ 4 mod 7

Similarly, subtract equation 1 from equation 3:

(6a + 2b + d) - (2b + 3c + d) ≡ 4 - 1 mod 7

Simplifies to:

6a - 3c ≡ 3 mod 7

So now we have two new congruences:

A. 6a - 2b ≡ 4 mod 7

B. 6a - 3c ≡ 3 mod 7

Additionally, equation 4 is:

6a + 2b + 3c ≡ 6 mod 7

So, we have:

A. 6a - 2b ≡ 4 mod 7

B. 6a - 3c ≡ 3 mod 7

C. 6a + 2b + 3c ≡ 6 mod 7

Let me see if we can solve these. Let's try to express variables in terms of a.

From equation A: 6a - 2b ≡ 4 mod 7

Let me solve for b:

-2b ≡ 4 - 6a mod 7

Multiply both sides by -2 inverse mod 7. Since -2 ≡ 5 mod 7, and 5*3 = 15 ≡ 1 mod 7, so inverse of 5 is 3. Therefore:

b ≡ (4 - 6a)*(-2)^{-1} mod 7 ≡ (4 - 6a)*3 mod 7

Compute (4 - 6a)*3 mod 7:

= 12 - 18a mod 7

12 mod 7 is 5, 18a mod 7 is 4a (since 18 = 2*7 + 4). So:

= 5 - 4a mod 7

Therefore, b ≡ (5 - 4a) mod 7

Since b is a digit from 0 to 9, but in the context of modulo 7, this gives b ≡ (5 - 4a) mod 7.

Similarly, from equation B: 6a - 3c ≡ 3 mod 7

Solve for c:

-3c ≡ 3 - 6a mod 7

Multiply both sides by -3 inverse mod 7. Since -3 ≡ 4 mod 7, and 4*2 = 8 ≡ 1 mod 7, so inverse of 4 is 2. Therefore:

c ≡ (3 - 6a)*(-3)^{-1} mod 7 ≡ (3 - 6a)*2 mod 7

Compute (3 - 6a)*2 mod 7:

= 6 - 12a mod 7

6 mod 7 is 6, 12a mod 7 is 5a (since 12 = 1*7 + 5). So:

= 6 - 5a mod 7

Therefore, c ≡ (6 - 5a) mod 7

Again, c is a digit from 0 to 9, but modulo 7, this gives c ≡ (6 - 5a) mod 7.

So now, we have expressions for b and c in terms of a. Let's note these:

b ≡ (5 - 4a) mod 7

c ≡ (6 - 5a) mod 7

Now, since a is a digit from 1 to 9, let's compute possible values of b and c for each a from 1 to 9, considering modulo 7.

But since b and c must be between 0 and 9, we can compute the values of (5 - 4a) mod 7 and (6 - 5a) mod 7, then adjust to get digits 0-9.

But let's first note that a is from 1 to 9, so let's compute (5 - 4a) mod 7 and (6 - 5a) mod 7 for each a from 1 to 9.

But since these expressions are modulo 7, the results will be between 0 and 6. However, since b and c are digits (0-9), we can take the result modulo 7 and then add 7 if necessary to get a digit in 0-9. Wait, but actually, since (5 - 4a) mod 7 gives a value between 0 and 6, and (6 - 5a) mod 7 also between 0 and 6. However, since b and c are digits (0-9), but in the problem, they are digits, so they can be 0-9. However, in the context of the problem, changing the digit to 1, but the original digits can be 0-9. Therefore, even if (5 - 4a) mod 7 gives a value between 0-6, b can be that value or that value plus 7. Similarly for c.

Wait, but actually, since a, b, c, d are digits (0-9), but in the original number N, a is from 1-9, and b, c, d from 0-9. However, in our equations, we have expressions for b and c modulo 7. Therefore, the actual values of b and c can be any digit (0-9) that is congruent to (5 - 4a) mod 7 and (6 - 5a) mod 7, respectively.

Therefore, for each a from 1 to 9, compute:

b ≡ (5 - 4a) mod 7

c ≡ (6 - 5a) mod 7

Then, b can be equal to (5 - 4a) mod 7 or (5 - 4a) + 7 mod 14, etc., but since b is a single digit, the possible values are (5 - 4a) mod 7 and (5 - 4a) + 7 mod 14, but since b is a digit, we can have two possibilities for each congruence: the residue mod 7 and the residue +7. However, since digits are 0-9, the possible values for b are the residue and residue +7 if residue +7 ≤ 9.

Similarly for c.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to note that since b ≡ (5 - 4a) mod 7, b can be (5 - 4a) + 7k for integer k such that b is between 0 and 9. Similarly for c.

But since we need to find b and c as digits, we can compute the possible values for each a.

But this might be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps we can find a such that both b and c are digits (0-9). Since a ranges from 1 to 9, let's compute for each a, the possible values of b and c.

Let's create a table for a from 1 to 9:

<Plan_8>
Based on execution_7.1:
So, after simplifying, we have:

1. b ≡ (5 - 4a) mod 7

2. c ≡ (6 - 5a) mod 7

3. 6a + 2b + 3c ≡ 6 mod 7

4. 6a + 2b + 3c ≡ 6 mod 7

Wait, equations 1, 2, 3 all lead to the same equation 3. So, equation 3 is redundant here.

Therefore, we can focus on equations 1, 2, and 4. But equation 4 is equivalent to equation 3. Wait, let's check:

<prompt_8.1> After simplifying, we have three key equations involving a, b, c. Verify if these equations are consistent and if they can be used to find a, b, c. </prompt_8.1>

<execution_8.1>
Equation 3: 6a + 2b + 3c ≡ 6 mod 7

But b and c are expressed in terms of a via equations 1 and 2. Therefore, substituting b and c from equations 1 and 2 into equation 3 should give a condition on a.

Let's try that. Substitute:

b ≡ (5 - 4a) mod 7

c ≡ (6 - 5a) mod 7

Therefore, 2b ≡ 2*(5 - 4a) mod 7

3c ≡ 3*(6 - 5a) mod 7

Therefore, equation 3 becomes:

6a + 2*(5 - 4a) + 3*(6 - 5a) ≡ 6 mod 7

Compute left-hand side:

6a + 10 - 8a + 18 - 15a ≡ (6a - 8a - 15a) + (10 + 18) ≡ (-17a) + 28 mod 7

Compute -17a mod 7: -17 ≡ -17 + 21 = 4 mod 7, so -17a ≡ 4a mod 7

28 mod 7 is 0, since 28 is divisible by 7.

Therefore, left-hand side ≡ 4a + 0 ≡ 4a mod 7

So, equation 3 simplifies to:

4a ≡ 6 mod 7

Solving for a:

4a ≡ 6 mod 7

Multiply both sides by the inverse of 4 mod 7. Since 4*2 = 8 ≡ 1 mod 7, inverse of 4 is 2.

Therefore, a ≡ 6*2 ≡ 12 ≡ 5 mod 7

Thus, a ≡ 5 mod 7. Since a is a digit from 1 to 9, possible values for a are 5 and 12, but 12 is invalid. Therefore, a = 5.

Therefore, a must be 5.

Based on execution_8.1:
Therefore, a = 5.

So, now we can compute b and c.

<prompt_9.1> With a=5, compute the values of b and c modulo 7 using the simplified expressions. Determine possible digit values for b and c. </prompt_9.1>

<Execution_9>
<execution_9.1>
Given a = 5:

From equation for b:

b ≡ (5 - 4*5) mod 7 = (5 - 20) mod 7 = (-15) mod 7

-15 divided by 7 is -3*7 = -21, so -15 - (-21) = 6. Therefore, -15 ≡ 6 mod 7. Therefore, b ≡ 6 mod 7. Therefore, possible values for b are 6 or 6 + 7 = 13, but since b is a digit, b can be 6 or 13. Wait, but 13 is not a digit, so b must be 6.

Similarly for c:

c ≡ (6 - 5*5) mod 7 = (6 - 25) mod 7 = (-19) mod 7

-19 divided by 7 is -3*7 = -21, so -19 - (-21) = 2. Therefore, -19 ≡ 2 mod 7. Therefore, c ≡ 2 mod 7. Therefore, possible values for c are 2 or 2 + 7 = 9. Since 9 is a digit, c can be 2 or 9.

Therefore, for a = 5, possible (b, c) pairs are (6, 2) and (6, 9).

<Plan_10>
Based on execution_9.1:
Now, for each possible (b, c), we can find d from equation 4:

Equation 4: 6a + 2b + 3c ≡ 6 mod 7

But since we already used this to find a, perhaps we need to use another equation to find d. Wait, but let's check if there's another condition.

Wait, equation 4 is the same as equation 3, which already gave us a = 5. So, after a is fixed, equations 1 and 2 give b and c, and then equation 4 is automatically satisfied. However, we also have equation 1: 2b + 3c + d ≡ 1 mod 7. Since we have b and c in terms of a, we can solve for d.

Wait, let's use equation 1:

2b + 3c + d ≡ 1 mod 7

We already have b and c in terms of a, so substituting b and c:

<prompt_10.1> Using the values of a=5 and the possible (b,c) pairs, solve for d using equation 1 and check if d is a valid digit (0-9). </prompt_10.1>
</Plan_10>

<Execution_10>
<execution_10.1>
2b + 3c + d ≡ 1 mod 7

Substitute b = 6, c = 2:

2*6 + 3*2 + d ≡ 12 + 6 + d ≡ 18 + d ≡ 18 mod 7 is 4 (since 14 is 2*7, 18-14=4). Therefore:

4 + d ≡ 1 mod 7

So, d ≡ 1 - 4 ≡ -3 ≡ 4 mod 7. Therefore, d ≡ 4 mod 7. So possible d values are 4 and 11, but 11 is invalid. So d = 4.

Similarly, for (b, c) = (6, 9):

2*6 + 3*9 + d ≡ 12 + 27 + d ≡ 39 + d ≡ 39 mod 7. 39 divided by 7 is 5*7=35, remainder 4. So 39 ≡ 4 mod 7. Therefore:

4 + d ≡ 1 mod 7 => d ≡ -3 ≡ 4 mod 7. So again, d = 4.

Therefore, for both (b, c) = (6, 2) and (6, 9), d = 4.

Based on execution_10.1:
Therefore, for a = 5, possible numbers are 5 6 2 4 and 5 6 9 4. However, the problem states that N is the greatest four-digit number with the given property. Therefore, we need to check which of these numbers is greater, but both have a = 5, b = 6, c = 2 or 9, d = 4.

Comparing 5624 and 5694, clearly 5694 is greater. Therefore, N = 5694.

But we need to verify if N = 5694 indeed satisfies the condition that changing any one digit to 1 gives a number divisible by 7. Let's check each case:

1. Changing thousands digit to 1: 1694. Check divisibility by 7.

<prompt_11.1> Verify the divisibility of the modified numbers 1694, 5194, 5614, 5691 by 7 to confirm they are divisible. </prompt_11.1>
</Plan_11>

<Execution_11>
<execution_11.1>
1694 ÷ 7: 7*242 = 1694. Correct. 1694 is divisible by 7.

2. Changing hundreds digit to 1: 5194. Check 5194 ÷ 7. 7*742 = 5194. Correct.

3. Changing tens digit to 1: 5614. 5614 ÷ 7. 7*802 = 5614. Correct.

4. Changing units digit to 1: 5691. 5691 ÷ 7. Let's compute 7*813 = 5691. Correct.

Therefore, 5694 satisfies all conditions. Therefore, N = 5694 is a candidate.

But the problem says N is the greatest four-digit number with this property. However, we need to check if there exists a larger number than 5694 (i.e., from 5700 to 9999) that satisfies the condition. But according to our previous deduction, a must be 5, since a ≡ 5 mod 7. Since a is a digit from 1-9, the next possible a after 5 would be 5 + 7 = 12, which is invalid. Therefore, a can only be 5. Therefore, there are no four-digit numbers with a > 5 that satisfy the conditions. Therefore, 5694 is the maximum possible.

But wait, let's check this conclusion. If a must be 5, then the maximum possible a is 5. Therefore, numbers from 5000 to 5999. Therefore, 5694 is the maximum in that range. Therefore, 5694 is the answer.

However, let's check if there is a higher number with a = 5, but higher b, c, or d. But according to our earlier analysis, for a = 5, b is fixed at 6, and c can be 2 or 9. Then d is fixed at 4. Therefore, the possible numbers are 5624 and 5694. Since 5694 is larger, that's our N.

But wait, let me check if there are other possible a values. Earlier, we deduced that a must be 5 because 4a ≡ 6 mod 7 leads to a ≡ 5 mod 7. But let me verify this step again. From equation 3 after substitution, we had:

4a ≡ 6 mod 7

Solving for a:

Multiply both sides by inverse of 4 mod 7, which is 2.

a ≡ 6*2 ≡ 12 ≡ 5 mod 7

Therefore, a must be 5. Therefore, there are no other possible a values. Therefore, the maximum N is 5694.

But wait, let's check if there's a higher number with a = 5, but higher digits in b, c, d. But according to our equations, b and c are fixed once a is fixed. For a = 5:

From equation for b: b ≡ (5 - 4*5) ≡ (5 - 20) ≡ -15 ≡ 6 mod 7. Therefore, possible b = 6 or 13, but 13 is invalid, so b = 6.

From equation for c: c ≡ (6 - 5*5) ≡ (6 - 25) ≡ -19 ≡ 2 mod 7. Therefore, possible c = 2 or 9.

Therefore, possible c are 2 and 9. Then, d is determined as 4. Therefore, the numbers are 5624 and 5694. Since 5694 is larger, that's the answer.

But wait, let's check if there's a higher number in a different a. Suppose, for example, a = 5, but maybe there's a higher number with a = 5 and higher digits in b, c, d? But according to the equations, b and c are fixed once a is fixed. Therefore, no, b and c are determined uniquely for a = 5. Wait, but c can be 2 or 9. So, 5624 and 5694. The latter is larger.

Based on execution_11.1:
Therefore, N = 5694. Therefore, Q = floor(N / 1000) = floor(5694 / 1000) = 5, and R = N mod 1000 = 694. Therefore, Q + R = 5 + 694 = 699.
Based on execution_11.1:
But wait, let me check if there's any mistake here. The problem statement says "the greatest four-digit positive integer N with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7". So, according to our analysis, N = 5694 is the maximum such number. But let me check if there's a higher number with a different a. For example, suppose we thought a could be 5 and some other values, but according to our equations, a must be 5. Therefore, 5694 is the maximum.

But wait, let me check if there's a number higher than 5694 that satisfies the conditions. For example, 5694 is the maximum in the 5000s. But what about numbers starting with 56, but with higher digits. For example, 5694 is the maximum with a = 5, b = 6, c = 9, d = 4. If there's a number with a = 5, b = 6, c = 9, d = 4, that's 5694. If we try to increase d from 4 to 5, but d must be 4. So, 5694 is the maximum in that case.

Alternatively, maybe there's a number with a = 5, b = 6, c = 9, d = 4, but what if we can have a higher number by changing a to 5, but with higher digits? But according to the equations, b and c are fixed once a is fixed. Therefore, no.

But wait, maybe there's a mistake in the earlier step where we solved for a. Let's re-examine that.

<prompt_12.1> Re-examine the equation 4a ≡ 6 mod 7 and confirm the solution for a=5. </prompt_12.1>
</Plan_12>

<Execution_12>
<execution_12.1>
We had:

From equation 3:

6a - 2b - 3c ≡ 5 mod 7

Then, substituting b and c:

6a - 2*(5 - 4a) - 3*(6 - 5a) ≡ 5 mod 7

Compute:

6a - 10 + 8a - 18 + 15a ≡ (6a + 8a + 15a) + (-10 - 18) ≡ 29a - 28 ≡ 1a - 0 ≡ a mod 7

Therefore, equation 3 simplifies to:

a ≡ 5 mod 7

Therefore, a = 5. So that part is correct.

Therefore, a must be 5. Therefore, N is between 5000 and 5999. The maximum possible number in this range is 5999, but according to our equations, b must be 6, and c can be 2 or 9, d must be 4. Therefore, 5694 is the maximum in this range.

But let's check if there's a number higher than 5694, for example, 5695, but according to our equations, d must be 4. Therefore, 5694 is the maximum.

Alternatively, maybe there's a number with a = 5, b = 6, c = 9, d = 4, which is 5694. Therefore, that's the maximum. Hence, Q = 5, R = 694, Q + R = 699.

Based on execution_12.1:
However, the problem states that N is the greatest four-digit number with the property. So, unless there's a higher number with a = 5, b = 6, c = 9, d = 4, but according to the equations, that's the only possibility. Therefore, 5694 is the answer.

But let's check if there's a mistake in the reasoning. Suppose we take a = 5, b = 6, c = 9, d = 4, then:

1. Changing thousands digit: 1694. 1694 ÷ 7 = 242, which is correct.

2. Changing hundreds digit: 5194. 5194 ÷ 7 = 742, correct.

3. Changing tens digit: 5614 ÷ 7 = 802, correct.

4. Changing units digit: 5691 ÷ 7 = 813, correct.

All are divisible by 7. So, N = 5694 is valid.
