<Question>
Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

Okay, so Jen is playing a lottery where she picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1, 2, 3, ...., 10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the randomly chosen ones, and she wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are selected. The question is asking for the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she already won a prize. The answer needs to be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

First, I need to recall the concept of conditional probability.

Conditional probability is the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred. The formula for conditional probability is:

P(A | B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)

Where P(A | B) is the probability of event A occurring given that B has occurred, P(A ∩ B) is the probability of both A and B occurring, and P(B) is the probability of event B occurring.

In this problem, event A is "Jen wins the grand prize," which means all four of her numbers are chosen. Event B is "Jen wins a prize," which means at least two of her numbers are among the four chosen. So, we need to find P(A | B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B).

But wait, if she wins the grand prize, then she must have all four numbers, which is a subset of winning at least two numbers. Therefore, the intersection of A and B is just A itself. So P(A ∩ B) is equal to P(A). Therefore, P(A | B) = P(A) / P(B).

Based on execution_1.1:
So, my task now is to compute P(A) and P(B), then divide them to get the conditional probability.

Let me think about how to compute P(A) and P(B).

<prompt_2.1> Compute the probabilities P(A) and P(B) using combinations and conditional probability. </prompt_2.1>

<execution_2.1>
First, let's compute P(A). The probability that Jen wins the grand prize is the probability that all four numbers she picked are exactly the four numbers chosen. Since the lottery is random, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is C(10, 4). Jen has picked one specific set of 4 numbers, so there's only 1 favorable outcome. Therefore, P(A) = 1 / C(10, 4).

Compute C(10, 4): 10! / (4! * 6! ) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So P(A) = 1/210.

Now, P(B) is the probability that at least two of Jen's numbers are among the four chosen. To compute this, it's easier to compute the complement probability: the probability that fewer than two of her numbers are chosen, i.e., 0 or 1. Then subtract that from 1.

So P(B) = 1 - [P(0) + P(1)].

Compute P(0): the probability that none of Jen's numbers are chosen. The lottery is choosing 4 numbers from 10, and we want none from Jen's 4. So the number of ways is C(6, 4) since there are 6 numbers not in Jen's set. Wait, hold on. Wait, Jen has picked 4 numbers, so the remaining numbers in S are 10 - 4 = 6. So the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from these 6 is C(6, 4). Therefore, P(0) = C(6, 4) / C(10, 4).

Compute C(6, 4): 6! / (4! * 2! ) = (6*5)/(2*1) = 15. So P(0) = 15 / 210 = 1/14.

Similarly, P(1): the probability that exactly one of Jen's numbers is chosen. So, we need to choose 1 number from Jen's 4 and 3 numbers from the remaining 6. Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is C(4, 1) * C(6, 3). Then divide by C(10, 4).

Compute C(4, 1) = 4, C(6, 3) = 20. So total favorable is 4*20 = 80. Therefore, P(1) = 80 / 210 = 8/21.

Therefore, P(B) = 1 - (1/14 + 8/21). Let's compute that. First, convert to common denominator. 1/14 is 3/42, 8/21 is 16/42. So 3/42 + 16/42 = 19/42. Therefore, P(B) = 1 - 19/42 = 23/42.

Therefore, the conditional probability P(A | B) = (1/210) / (23/42) = (1/210) * (42/23) = (42)/(210*23) = (1)/(5*23) = 1/115.

Wait, 42 divided by 210 is 1/5, so 1/5 divided by 23 is 1/(5*23) = 1/115. So the probability is 1/115. Therefore, m = 1, n = 115, which are coprime. So m + n = 116.

Based on execution_2.1:
However, let me verify this again because sometimes when dealing with conditional probabilities, especially with overlapping events, it's easy to make a mistake.

<prompt_3.1> Verify the conditional probability calculation by checking the steps and ensuring the logic is sound. </prompt_3.1>

Alternatively, maybe we can compute it directly using combinations.

Since we are given that Jen has picked 4 numbers, and the lottery picks 4 numbers.

<prompt_3.2> Verify the conditional probability calculation by directly counting favorable and total cases. </prompt_3.2>

Wait, but let me check if the initial approach is correct. Since we are given that she has won a prize, which is at least two numbers, so the conditional probability is the probability that all four numbers are chosen given that at least two are chosen. So the conditional probability is equal to the number of favorable cases (which is 1, since only one set of four numbers) divided by the number of cases where at least two of her numbers are chosen. So maybe another way to compute this is by counting the number of possible lottery outcomes where at least two of Jen's numbers are chosen, and then dividing by that total number.

So total number of possible lottery outcomes is C(10, 4) = 210. The number of favorable outcomes (where at least two of Jen's numbers are chosen) is equal to C(4,2)*C(6,2) + C(4,3)*C(6,1) + C(4,4)*C(6,0). Wait, that's another way to compute P(B). Let's see:

For exactly 2 numbers: C(4,2)*C(6,2) = 6*15 = 90.

For exactly 3 numbers: C(4,3)*C(6,1) = 4*6 = 24.

For exactly 4 numbers: C(4,4)*C(6,0) = 1*1 = 1.

Total number of favorable outcomes: 90 + 24 + 1 = 115. Therefore, P(B) = 115 / 210 = 23/42, which matches our previous result. So that's correct.

Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes for A ∩ B is 1 (only the case where all four numbers are chosen). So the conditional probability is 1 / 115. Therefore, m = 1, n = 115, so m + n = 116.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
The total number of possible lottery outcomes is C(10, 4) = 210.

Given that Jen has picked her 4 numbers, the number of possible lottery outcomes where at least two of her numbers are selected is the same as the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from S such that at least two are in Jen's set.

But perhaps using the conditional probability approach is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the conditional probability can be considered as the number of favorable outcomes (i.e., the lottery picks all of Jen's numbers) over the number of possible lottery outcomes that have at least two numbers in common with Jen's set.

So, the conditional probability would be:

Number of favorable outcomes (grand prize) / Number of lottery outcomes with at least two numbers in Jen's set.

Number of favorable outcomes is 1 (only one way the lottery can pick all four of Jen's numbers).

Number of lottery outcomes with at least two numbers in Jen's set: C(4, 2)*C(6, 2) + C(4, 3)*C(6, 1) + C(4, 4)*C(6, 0)

Compute each term:

C(4, 2)*C(6, 2): 6 * 15 = 90

C(4, 3)*C(6, 1): 4 * 6 = 24

C(4, 4)*C(6, 0): 1 * 1 = 1

Total: 90 + 24 + 1 = 115

Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is 1, so the conditional probability is 1/115, same as before.

So this confirms the previous result. Therefore, m = 1, n = 115, so m + n = 116.

C(10, 4) is indeed 210. Then, the number of lottery outcomes with at least two numbers in Jen's set is 115. Therefore, the conditional probability is 1/115. So the answer is 116.

Therefore, the answer is 116.
