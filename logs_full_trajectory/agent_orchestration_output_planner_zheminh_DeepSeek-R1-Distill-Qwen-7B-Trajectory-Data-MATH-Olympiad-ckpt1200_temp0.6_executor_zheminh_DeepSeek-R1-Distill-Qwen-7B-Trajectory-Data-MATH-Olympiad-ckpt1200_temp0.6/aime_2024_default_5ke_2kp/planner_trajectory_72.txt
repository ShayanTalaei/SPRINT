</Question>

<think>
<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\), where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\). Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step.

First, since \(|z| = 4\), that means \(z\) lies on a circle in the complex plane with radius 4 centered at the origin. So, \(z\) can be represented in the form \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\), where \(\theta\) is the argument of \(z\). That might be useful later.

The expression we need to maximize is the real part of \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\). Let me denote this expression as \(E\), so:

\(E = \text{Re}\left[ (75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} \right]\)

Since the real part is a linear operator, we can separate the terms:

\(E = \text{Re}\left[ (75 + 117i)z \right] + \text{Re}\left[ \frac{96 + 144i}{z} \right]\)

Let me handle each term separately. Let's start with the first term: \(\text{Re}\left[ (75 + 117i)z \right]\).

<prompt_1.1> Simplify the expression for the real part of the first term \(\text{Re}\left[ (75 + 117i)z \right]\) using the fact that \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\). </prompt_1.1>

Now, moving on to the second term: \(\text{Re}\left[ \frac{96 + 144i}{z} \right]\). Since \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\), then \(\frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}\). Therefore:

\(\frac{96 + 144i}{z} = \frac{96 + 144i}{4}e^{-i\theta} = (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}\)

So, the real part of this term is:

\(\text{Re}\left[ (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \right]\)

Again, using the formula for the real part of a complex number multiplied by \(e^{-i\theta}\):

<prompt_1.2> Simplify the expression for the real part of the second term \(\text{Re}\left[ \frac{96 + 144i}{z} \right]\). </prompt_1.2>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
Let me write \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\), so substituting that in:

\(\text{Re}\left[ (75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} \right] = 4 \cdot \text{Re}\left[ (75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} \right]\)

Now, expanding \(e^{i\theta}\) as \(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta\), we can write:

\( (75 + 117i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) = 75\cos\theta + 75i\sin\theta + 117i\cos\theta + 117i^2\sin\theta \)

Since \(i^2 = -1\), this simplifies to:

\(75\cos\theta + 75i\sin\theta + 117i\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta\)

Grouping the real and imaginary parts:

Real part: \(75\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta\)

Imaginary part: \(75\sin\theta + 117\cos\theta\)

Therefore, the real part of the first term is:

\(4 \cdot (75\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta)\)

Which simplifies to:

\(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta\)
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
\(\text{Re}\left[ (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \right] = 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta\)

Therefore, combining both terms, the total expression \(E\) is:

\(E = 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta + 75\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta\)

Wait, let me check that again. The first term was \(\text{Re}[(75 + 117i)z] = 75\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta\), right? Because \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\), so \(75\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta\), and the second term is \(24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta\). Adding them together:

\(E = (75\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta) + (24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) = (75 + 24)\cos\theta + (-117 + 36)\sin\theta = 99\cos\theta - 81\sin\theta\)
</execution_1.2>
</Execution_1>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1, execution_1.2:
Okay, so now we have \(E = 99\cos\theta - 81\sin\theta\). The goal is to find the maximum value of this expression as \(\theta\) varies over all real numbers (since \(z\) can be any complex number with \(|z| = 4\), which corresponds to all possible \(\theta\)).

This is a standard optimization problem where we need to maximize a linear combination of sine and cosine. The maximum value of \(A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta\) is \(\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}\). So, applying this formula here, the maximum value of \(E\) should be:

\(\sqrt{99^2 + (-81)^2} = \sqrt{9801 + 6561} = \sqrt{16362}\)

Let me compute that.

<prompt_2.1> Compute the maximum value of the expression \(E = 99\cos\theta - 81\sin\theta\) using the formula for the maximum of \(A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta\). </prompt_2.1>
-----

But just to make sure I haven't made any mistakes in the algebra steps. Let me go through the steps again.

<prompt_2.2> Verify the algebraic steps and calculations for the expression \(E = 99\cos\theta - 81\sin\theta\). </prompt_2.2>

But just to make sure, perhaps I can approach this problem using a different method to confirm the result. Let's try using complex numbers and conjugates.

<prompt_2.3> Use a different method involving complex numbers and conjugates to solve the problem and verify the result. </prompt_2.3>

Alternatively, using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. Let's consider the expression as a dot product.

<prompt_2.4> Use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to verify the maximum value of the expression \(99\cos\theta - 81\sin\theta\). </prompt_2.4>

Alternatively, using parametric equations. Let me set \(x = \cos\theta\), \(y = \sin\theta\), so \(x^2 + y^2 = 1\), and we need to maximize \(99x -81y\). This is a linear function over the unit circle, which indeed has maximum value \(\sqrt{99^2 +81^2}\).

<prompt_2.5> Use parametric equations and the unit circle to verify the maximum value of the expression \(99\cos\theta - 81\sin\theta\). </prompt_2.5>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
First, compute \(99^2\):

\(99^2 = (100 - 1)^2 = 10000 - 200 + 1 = 9801\)

Then, compute \(81^2\):

\(81^2 = 6561\)

Adding them:

\(9801 + 6561 = 16362\)

So, \(\sqrt{16362}\). Let's see if this can be simplified. Let's factor 16362:

Divide by 2: 16362 ÷ 2 = 8181

8181 ÷ 3 = 2727

2727 ÷ 3 = 909

909 ÷ 3 = 303

303 ÷ 3 = 101

So, 16362 = 2 × 3^4 × 101

Therefore, \(\sqrt{16362} = \sqrt{2 \times 3^4 \times 101} = 3^2 \sqrt{2 \times 101} = 9 \sqrt{202}\)

Since 202 factors into 2 × 101, which are both primes. So, \(\sqrt{202}\) is approximately 14.212, so 9 × 14.212 ≈ 127.908. But since the problem asks for the exact value, we can leave it as \(9\sqrt{202}\).
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Starting from the expression:

\(E = \text{Re}\left[ (75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} \right]\)

Substituting \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\):

First term: \(\text{Re}[(75 + 117i)4e^{i\theta}] = 4 \cdot \text{Re}[(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta}]\)

Expanding \((75 + 117i)e^{i\theta}\):

\(75e^{i\theta} + 117i e^{i\theta} = 75(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + 117i(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)\)

Which is:

\(75\cos\theta + 75i\sin\theta + 117i\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta\)

So real part: \(75\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta\)

Multiply by 4: \(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta\)

Second term: \(\text{Re}\left[\frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}}\right] = \text{Re}\left[ (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \right]\)

Expanding that:

\(24e^{-i\theta} + 36i e^{-i\theta} = 24(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) + 36i(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta)\)

Which is:

\(24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta\)

Real part: \(24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta\)

Adding both terms:

\(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta = (300 + 24)\cos\theta + (-468 + 36)\sin\theta = 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\)

Wait a second, this contradicts the previous result. Hmm, so which one is correct?

Wait, let me check the second term again. The second term is \(\frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = \frac{96 + 144i}{4} e^{-i\theta} = (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}\). Then, expanding that:

\(24e^{-i\theta} + 36i e^{-i\theta}\)

Which is \(24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta\). So the real part is \(24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta\). So that part is correct.

Then the first term was \(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta\). Adding them together:

\(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta = (300 + 24)\cos\theta + (-468 + 36)\sin\theta = 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\)

Wait, so that's different from the previous result. So this suggests that I made a mistake in the first calculation. Let me check the first term again.
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
Let me write \(E\) as:

\(E = (75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\)

Since \(|z| = 4\), we know that \(\overline{z} = \frac{4^2}{z} = \frac{16}{z}\), because \(z \overline{z} = |z|^2 = 16\). So, \(\overline{z} = 16/z\). Therefore, \(\frac{1}{z} = \overline{z}/16\). So, substituting that into the expression:

\(E = (75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} = (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)\frac{\overline{z}}{16}\)

Hmm, not sure if this helps directly, but maybe we can write this as a complex number times \(z + \overline{z}\) or something. Alternatively, perhaps take the conjugate of the entire expression and relate it to the original expression.

Alternatively, let's denote \(w = z\), then \(E = (75 + 117i)w + \frac{96 + 144i}{w}\). The real part of \(E\) is what we need. Let's write \(E\) as a complex number:

\(E = (75 + 117i)w + \frac{96 + 144i}{w}\)

Taking the real part:

\(\text{Re}(E) = \text{Re}\left[ (75 + 117i)w + \frac{96 + 144i}{w} \right]\)

Let me denote \(w = re^{i\phi}\), where \(r = |w| = 4\), so \(w = 4e^{i\phi}\). Then \(\frac{1}{w} = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\phi}\). Therefore:

\(\text{Re}(E) = \text{Re}\left[ (75 + 117i)4e^{i\phi} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4}e^{-i\phi} \right]\)

Which is the same as before:

\(4(75 + 117i)e^{i\phi} + 24(1 + 3i)e^{-i\phi}\)

Wait, no, 96 + 144i divided by 4 is 24 + 36i, not 24(1 + 3i). Wait, 96/4 = 24, 144/4 = 36, so it's 24 + 36i. So, the second term is (24 + 36i)e^{-i\phi}.

Then, expanding both terms:

First term: (75 + 117i)4e^{i\phi} = 4*(75 + 117i)(cos\phi + i sin\phi)

Second term: (24 + 36i)e^{-i\phi} = (24 + 36i)(cos\phi - i sin\phi)

Calculating the real parts:

First term's real part: 4*(75 cos\phi - 117 sin\phi)

Second term's real part: 24 cos\phi + 36 sin\phi

Adding them together:

4*75 cos\phi - 4*117 sin\phi + 24 cos\phi + 36 sin\phi

Which is:

300 cos\phi - 468 sin\phi + 24 cos\phi + 36 sin\phi

Combine like terms:

(300 + 24) cos\phi + (-468 + 36) sin\phi = 324 cos\phi - 432 sin\phi

Wait, hold on! This is different from what I had before. Wait, this contradicts my previous result. Wait, this can't be. There must be a mistake here.

Wait, let's check the coefficients again. In the first term: 75*4 = 300, 117*4 = 468. Then in the second term: 24*1 = 24, 36*1 = 36. So when combining, the coefficients are:

300 cos\phi + 24 cos\phi = 324 cos\phi

-468 sin\phi + 36 sin\phi = (-468 + 36) sin\phi = -432 sin\phi

So, the total expression is 324 cos\phi - 432 sin\phi. Wait, but earlier I had 99 cos\phi -81 sin\phi. These are different. So which one is correct?

Wait, this is concerning. There must be a miscalculation. Let's go back to the beginning.

Original expression: (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z. Let me compute each term step by step.

First term: (75 + 117i)z. If z = 4e^{i\theta}, then:

(75 + 117i)*4e^{i\theta} = 4*(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta}

The real part of this is 4*Re[(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta}]. As before, expanding (75 + 117i)(cos\theta + i sin\theta):

= 75 cos\theta + 75i sin\theta + 117i cos\theta - 117 sin\theta

Real part: 75 cos\theta - 117 sin\theta

Multiply by 4: 300 cos\theta - 468 sin\theta

Second term: (96 + 144i)/z = (96 + 144i)/(4e^{i\theta}) = (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}

The real part of this is 24 cos\theta + 36 sin\theta

Adding both terms:

300 cos\theta - 468 sin\theta + 24 cos\theta + 36 sin\theta = (300 + 24) cos\theta + (-468 + 36) sin\theta = 324 cos\theta - 432 sin\theta

Therefore, the total expression is 324 cos\theta - 432 sin\theta. So the coefficient is 324 and -432. Then the maximum value is sqrt(324^2 + 432^2). Let's compute that.

324 squared: 324*324. Let's compute 300^2 = 90000, 24^2 = 576, and cross term 2*300*24 = 14400. So (300 + 24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 + 24^2 = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 104,976.

Similarly, 432 squared: 432*432. Let's compute 400^2 = 160,000, 32^2 = 1,024, and cross term 2*400*32 = 25,600. So (400 + 32)^2 = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 186,624.

Therefore, sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600). What's sqrt(291,600)? Let's see, 540^2 = 291,600 because 500^2 = 250,000, 40^2 = 1,600, and 2*500*40 = 40,000. So (500 + 40)^2 = 500^2 + 2*500*40 + 40^2 = 250,000 + 40,000 + 1,600 = 291,600. Therefore, sqrt(291,600) = 540.

Wait, so the maximum value is 540? But earlier I thought it was sqrt(99^2 + (-81)^2) = 16362^0.5. Wait, so where did I go wrong earlier?

Wait, in the first approach, I made a mistake in the coefficients. Let me check again.

Original expression: (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z. Let me compute each term again.

First term: (75 + 117i)z. If z = 4e^{i\theta}, then:

(75 + 117i)*4e^{i\theta} = 4*(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta}

Compute the real part:

4*Re[(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta}] = 4*(75 cosθ - 117 sinθ) = 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ

Second term: (96 + 144i)/z = (96 + 144i)/(4e^{iθ}) = (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}

Compute the real part:

24 cosθ + 36 sinθ

Therefore, adding both terms:

300 cosθ - 468 sinθ + 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ = (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ

Ah! So the coefficients are 324 and -432, not 99 and -81 as I previously thought. So the maximum value is sqrt(324^2 + 432^2) = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600) = 540. So the previous approach had an error in the coefficients.

Therefore, my initial mistake was in incorrectly combining the terms. The correct coefficients are 324 and -432, leading to a maximum real part of 540. Therefore, the answer should be 540.
</execution_2.3>

<execution_2.4>
Let me write the expression \(99\cos\theta -81\sin\theta\) as \(A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta\), where \(A = 99\) and \(B = -81\). Then, the maximum value of \(A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta\) is \(\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}\), which is exactly what I used earlier. So, that's correct.

Alternatively, if I consider the expression as a complex number \(99 - 81i\) multiplied by \(e^{i\theta}\), then the modulus of \(99 - 81i\) is \(\sqrt{99^2 +81^2}\), which is the maximum value of the real part when multiplied by \(e^{i\theta}\). Wait, but actually, the real part of \((99 -81i)e^{i\theta}\) is \(99\cos\theta -81\sin\theta\), and the maximum value of this is the modulus of \(99 -81i\), which is indeed \(\sqrt{99^2 +81^2}\). So that's another way to see it.

Therefore, the maximum value of the real part \(E\) is \(\sqrt{16362}\).
</execution_2.4>

<execution_2.5>
So that's another way to see it.

Therefore, the maximum value is indeed \(\sqrt{99^2 + 81^2} = \sqrt{9801 + 6561} = \sqrt{16362}\).

Calculating \(\sqrt{16362}\):

Let me compute 127^2 = 16129, 128^2 = 16384. So 127^2 = 16129, 128^2 = 16384. So 16362 is between them. 16384 - 16362 = 22. So sqrt(16362) = 128 - 22/(2*128) approximately, but maybe exact value.

Wait, 16362 divided by 9: 16362 / 9 = 1818. 1818 / 9 = 202. So 16362 = 9 * 1818 = 9 * 9 * 202 = 81 * 202. Wait, 202 is 2*101. So sqrt(81*202) = 9*sqrt(202). So sqrt(16362) = 9*sqrt(202). Let me check: 9*sqrt(202). 202 is 2*101, so sqrt(202) is irrational. So the exact value is 9√202. But the problem says "Find the largest possible real part", so maybe we need to rationalize or present it as a decimal? Wait, the problem doesn't specify, but since it's a competition-style problem, often the answer is an integer or a simplified radical. Let me check if 99 and 81 have a common factor. 99 is 9*11, 81 is 9*9. So sqrt(99^2 +81^2) = sqrt(9^2*(11^2 +9^2)) = 9*sqrt(121 +81) = 9*sqrt(202). So 9√202 is the exact value. However, maybe the problem expects the answer in a particular form. Let me check the original problem again.

Wait, the original problem is to find the largest possible real part. So perhaps the answer is 9√202, but let me check if I made any miscalculations in the earlier steps.

Wait, let's retrace:

Original expression: (75 +117i)z + (96 +144i)/z, |z|=4.

Express z as 4e^{iθ}, so 1/z = (1/4)e^{-iθ}.

Then, compute (75 +117i)z = (75 +117i)*4e^{iθ} = 4*(75 +117i)e^{iθ}

Similarly, (96 +144i)/z = (96 +144i)*(1/4)e^{-iθ} = 24*(96 +144i)/24? Wait, wait, 96 +144i divided by 4 is 24 +36i. So yes, (24 +36i)e^{-iθ}.

Then, taking real parts:

First term: Re[(75 +117i)z] = Re[4*(75 +117i)e^{iθ}] = 4*Re[(75 +117i)(cosθ +i sinθ)]

Which expands to 4*(75 cosθ -117 sinθ) = 300 cosθ -468 sinθ.

Second term: Re[(24 +36i)e^{-iθ}] = Re[24 cosθ +36 sinθ +24 i sinθ -36 cosθ i]

Wait, actually, maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, (24 +36i)e^{-iθ} = 24 e^{-iθ} +36i e^{-iθ} = 24 (cosθ -i sinθ) +36i (cosθ -i sinθ)

=24 cosθ -24i sinθ +36i cosθ -36i^2 sinθ

=24 cosθ -24i sinθ +36i cosθ +36 sinθ

So grouping real and imaginary parts:

Real:24 cosθ +36 sinθ

Imaginary:-24 sinθ +36 cosθ

Therefore, Re[(24 +36i)e^{-iθ}] =24 cosθ +36 sinθ

Therefore, adding to the first term:

300 cosθ -468 sinθ +24 cosθ +36 sinθ = (300 +24) cosθ + (-468 +36) sinθ =324 cosθ -432 sinθ.

Wait, hold on! Wait, previously I had 99 cosθ -81 sinθ, but now I have 324 cosθ -432 sinθ. Which is different. So there's a discrepancy here. So which one is correct?

Wait, let's re-examine the steps.

First term: (75 +117i)z. z =4 e^{iθ}, so (75 +117i)z =4*(75 +117i)e^{iθ}. Taking the real part:

Re[4*(75 +117i)e^{iθ}] =4*Re[(75 +117i)(cosθ +i sinθ)]

Expanding (75 +117i)(cosθ +i sinθ):

75 cosθ +75i sinθ +117i cosθ +117i^2 sinθ

=75 cosθ +75i sinθ +117i cosθ -117 sinθ

So real part:75 cosθ -117 sinθ

Multiply by 4: 300 cosθ -468 sinθ

Second term: (96 +144i)/z = (96 +144i)/4 e^{-iθ} =24 +36i multiplied by e^{-iθ}

So (24 +36i)e^{-iθ} =24 e^{-iθ} +36i e^{-iθ}

=24 (cosθ -i sinθ) +36i (cosθ -i sinθ)

=24 cosθ -24i sinθ +36i cosθ -36i^2 sinθ

=24 cosθ -24i sinθ +36i cosθ +36 sinθ

Real part:24 cosθ +36 sinθ

Imaginary part:-24 sinθ +36 cosθ

Therefore, the real part of the second term is24 cosθ +36 sinθ

Therefore, total expression E is:

300 cosθ -468 sinθ +24 cosθ +36 sinθ = (300 +24) cosθ + (-468 +36) sinθ =324 cosθ -432 sinθ

So, E=324 cosθ -432 sinθ

Therefore, the maximum value is sqrt(324^2 +432^2)

Compute that:

324^2: 324*324. Let's compute 300^2=90000, 24^2=576, and 2*300*24=14400. So (300+24)^2=300^2 +2*300*24 +24^2=90000 +14400 +576=104,976

Similarly, 432^2: 400^2=160,000, 32^2=1,024, 2*400*32=25,600. So (400+32)^2=160,000 +25,600 +1,024=186,624

Therefore, 324^2 +432^2=104,976 +186,624=291,600

Therefore, sqrt(291,600)=sqrt(2916*100)=sqrt(2916)*10. sqrt(2916): 50^2=2500, 54^2=2916. So sqrt(2916)=54. Therefore, sqrt(291,600)=54*10=540.

So the maximum value is 540.

Wait, so my initial calculation was wrong because I miscalculated the coefficients. Let me check again.

Wait, originally, I thought E=99 cosθ -81 sinθ, but that was incorrect. The correct coefficients are 324 and -432, leading to sqrt(324^2 +432^2)=540.

Wait, so where did I go wrong? Let's check the steps again.

Original expression:

First term: (75 +117i)z. z=4e^{iθ}, so (75 +117i)z=4*(75 +117i)e^{iθ}

Real part:4*Re[(75 +117i)e^{iθ}]=4*(75 cosθ -117 sinθ)=300 cosθ -468 sinθ. Correct.

Second term: (96 +144i)/z=(96 +144i)/4 e^{-iθ}=24 +36i multiplied by e^{-iθ}

As above, (24 +36i)e^{-iθ}=24 cosθ +36 sinθ +i(-24 sinθ +36 cosθ). So real part is24 cosθ +36 sinθ. Correct.

Therefore, total E=300 cosθ -468 sinθ +24 cosθ +36 sinθ=324 cosθ -432 sinθ. Correct.

Therefore, the maximum value is sqrt(324^2 +432^2)=sqrt(104,976 +186,624)=sqrt(291,600)=540.

Therefore, the answer should be 540. So where did I go wrong earlier? Initially, I thought the coefficients were 99 and -81, but that was incorrect. The correct coefficients are 324 and -432, leading to a maximum value of 540. That makes sense because 324 and -432 can be simplified by dividing by 108: 324/108=3, 432/108=4. So 324 cosθ -432 sinθ=108*(3 cosθ -4 sinθ). Then, the maximum of 3 cosθ -4 sinθ is 5, so 108*5=540. That's another way to see it.

Therefore, the maximum real part is 540. So that's the answer.

But let me just confirm once again by going through the steps one more time.

Let me compute 324 cosθ -432 sinθ. Let's factor out 108: 108*(3 cosθ -4 sinθ). The expression inside the parentheses is 3 cosθ -4 sinθ. The maximum of A cosθ + B sinθ is sqrt(A^2 + B^2). So here, A=3, B=-4, so sqrt(9 +16)=5. Therefore, 108*5=540. Therefore, the maximum value is indeed 540.

Therefore, the answer is 540.
