<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to find the remainder when the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\) is divided by 1000, where \(\omega\) is a 13th root of unity not equal to 1. Hmm, this seems a bit complex, but let me try breaking it down step by step.

First, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties. Since \(\omega\) is a 13th root of unity, \(\omega^{13} = 1\), and the minimal polynomial for \(\omega\) over the rationals is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is \(\Phi_{13}(x) = x^{12} + x^{11} + \dots + x + 1\). But I'm not sure yet how this helps.

<execution_1.1>
The product is over k from 0 to 12, so there are 13 terms. Each term is \(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}\). Let me write that as \(2 - 2\omega^k + (\omega^k)^2\). Wait, that looks like a quadratic in \(\omega^k\). Let me check: \(x^2 - 2x + 2\). So each term is \(x^2 - 2x + 2\) evaluated at \(x = \omega^k\). So the product becomes \(\prod_{k=0}^{12} ( (\omega^k)^2 - 2\omega^k + 2 )\).

Wait, so if I let \(P(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2\), then the product is \(\prod_{k=0}^{12} P(\omega^k)\). But since \(\omega^k\) for k from 0 to 12 are all the 13th roots of unity, except when k=0, \(\omega^0 = 1\). Wait, but k goes from 0 to 12, so \(\omega^0 = 1\), and \(\omega^1, \omega^2, \dots, \omega^{12}\) are the other 12 primitive 13th roots. So the product is over all 13th roots of unity of P(x). Therefore, the product is equal to the product of P(\(\omega^k\)) for all 13th roots \(\omega^k\), which is the same as evaluating the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12} (x - \omega^k)\) at x = 1, 2, ..., but maybe I need a different approach.

Wait, the product over all roots of unity of a polynomial evaluated at those roots. There's a theorem that says that if f(x) is a polynomial, then the product of f(\(\omega^k\)) for k=0 to n-1 (where \(\omega\) is a primitive nth root) is equal to the resultant of f and x^n - 1. But I'm not sure if I remember that correctly. Alternatively, there's a formula that the product over all nth roots of unity of (x - \(\omega^k\)) is x^n - 1. But here, we have a product over (a quadratic evaluated at each root). Maybe we can use the fact that the product over all roots of unity of (a quadratic) can be expressed in terms of cyclotomic polynomials.

Alternatively, since the product is over all 13th roots of unity of P(\(\omega\)), where P(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2, then this product is equal to the resultant of P(x) and x^{13} - 1. The resultant of two polynomials f and g is the product of f evaluated at the roots of g. So in this case, the resultant of P(x) and x^{13} - 1 is exactly the product we need. The resultant can be computed using the Sylvester matrix, but maybe there's a smarter way here.

Alternatively, since x^{13} - 1 factors into linear terms over the 13th roots of unity, and P(x) is a quadratic, the product over all roots of P(\(\omega^k\)) is the same as the product over all roots of x^{13} - 1 of P(x). Wait, but that might not be directly helpful. Let me think.

Alternatively, if we consider that the product over all 13th roots of unity of P(\(\omega^k\)) is equal to the product over all roots of x^{13} - 1 of P(x). So if we can compute the product of P(x) as x ranges over all roots of x^{13} - 1, which is the same as evaluating the resultant of P(x) and x^{13} - 1. Alternatively, since the product over all roots of P(x) is the same as the product of P(\(\omega^k\)) for k=0 to 12. 

But how do we compute this resultant? The resultant of two polynomials f and g is the product of f evaluated at the roots of g, multiplied by the leading coefficient of g raised to the degree of f. Since x^{13} - 1 has leading coefficient 1 and degree 13, the resultant is just the product of P(\(\omega^k\)) for k=0 to 12. So that's exactly our product. So we need to compute the resultant of P(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2 and x^{13} - 1. 

Alternatively, another approach: since the product is over all 13th roots of unity of P(\(\omega^k\)), and since P(x) is a quadratic, maybe we can factor it as (x - a)(x - b), then the product becomes the product over all roots of unity of (a - \(\omega^k\))(b - \(\omega^k\)) = (a^{13} - 1)(b^{13} - 1). Wait, is that right? Let me check.
</execution_1.1>
</Execution_1>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
If P(x) = (x - a)(x - b), then the product over all roots of unity of P(\(\omega^k\)) is the product over all roots of unity of (a - \(\omega^k\))(b - \(\omega^k\)) = [product over roots of unity (a - \(\omega^k\))] * [product over roots of unity (b - \(\omega^k\))]. But the product over roots of unity (a - \(\omega^k\)) is a^{13} - 1, because x^{13} - 1 factors as product_{k=0}^{12} (x - \(\omega^k\)), so substituting x = a gives a^{13} - 1. Similarly for b. Therefore, the product is (a^{13} - 1)(b^{13} - 1).

So if we can factor P(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2 into (x - a)(x - b), then compute (a^{13} - 1)(b^{13} - 1), that would give the desired product.

Let me try that.

<prompt_2.1> Factor the polynomial \(x^2 - 2x + 2\) into linear factors \((x - a)(x - b)\), then compute the product \((a^{13} - 1)(b^{13} - 1)\). </prompt_2.1>
-----

But let me check if this is correct. Let's take a simple case. Suppose instead of 13th roots, we use 2nd roots. Let’s say we want to compute the product over k=0 to 1 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} ). Then ω is a primitive 2nd root, so ω = -1. Then the product is (2 - 2*(-1) + (-1)^2)*(2 - 2*1 + 1^2) = (2 + 2 + 1)*(2 - 2 + 1) = (5)*(1) = 5. According to the formula above, P(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2. Factoring, discriminant is 4 - 8 = -4, so roots are [2 ± 2i]/2 = 1 ± i. Then ( (1 + i)^2 - 1 )*( (1 - i)^2 - 1 ). Wait, but according to the previous formula, product is (a^{2} - 1)(b^{2} - 1). Wait, but in this case, the degree is 2, so exponent is 2. Let me compute (1 + i)^2 - 1. (1 + 2i + i^2) - 1 = (1 + 2i -1) -1 = 2i -1. Similarly, (1 - i)^2 -1 = (1 - 2i + i^2) -1 = (1 - 2i -1) -1 = -2i -1. Then the product is (2i -1)(-2i -1) = (-1 -2i)(-1 + 2i) = (-1)^2 - (2i)^2 = 1 - (-4) = 5. Which matches the direct computation. So the formula works here. Therefore, applying the same formula for 13th roots seems valid.

Therefore, the answer is 5 mod 1000? Wait, but 5 mod 1000 is 5. But let me check again. Wait, in the 2nd root case, the product was 5, which is 5 mod 1000. But 5 is less than 1000, so the remainder is 5. But in the original problem, the product is 5 mod 1000? Wait, but 5 is less than 1000, so the remainder is 5. But let me check another example. Suppose we take 3rd roots. Let me test with 3rd roots of unity.

<prompt_2.2> Test the formula with 3rd roots of unity and verify if the product matches the direct computation. </prompt_2.2>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
First, find the roots of P(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2. Using the quadratic formula: x = [2 ± sqrt(4 - 8)] / 2 = [2 ± sqrt(-4)] / 2 = [2 ± 2i]/2 = 1 ± i. So the roots are 1 + i and 1 - i. Therefore, P(x) factors as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).

Therefore, the product we need is [ (1 + i)^{13} - 1 ] * [ (1 - i)^{13} - 1 ]. So if we can compute these two terms modulo 1000, then multiply them and take modulo 1000, we should get the answer.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Let P(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2. Let's compute the product over k=0 to 2 of P(\(\omega^k\)), where \(\omega\) is a primitive 3rd root of unity. Then according to the formula, the product should be (a^3 - 1)(b^3 - 1), where a and b are the roots of P(x). Let's compute a and b. The roots of P(x) are [2 ± sqrt(-4)]/2 = 1 ± i. Then a = 1 + i, b = 1 - i. Then a^3 = (1 + i)^3. Let's compute that. (1 + i)^2 = 1 + 2i + i^2 = 1 + 2i -1 = 2i. Then (1 + i)^3 = (1 + i)(2i) = 2i + 2i^2 = 2i - 2. Similarly, b^3 = (1 - i)^3 = (1 - i)^2*(1 - i) = (1 - 2i + i^2)(1 - i) = (1 - 2i -1)(1 - i) = (-2i)(1 - i) = -2i + 2i^2 = -2i - 2. Therefore, a^3 -1 = ( -2 - 2i ) -1 = -3 - 2i, and b^3 -1 = (-2 + 2i) -1 = -3 + 2i. Then the product is (-3 - 2i)(-3 + 2i) = 9 - (2i)^2 = 9 - (-4) = 13. Now, compute the product directly: P(1) = 1 - 2 + 2 = 1, P(\(\omega\)) = \(\omega^2 - 2\omega + 2\), P(\(\omega^2\)) = \(\omega^4 - 2\omega^2 + 2\). Since \(\omega^3 = 1\), \(\omega^4 = \omega\). So P(\(\omega^2\)) = \(\omega - 2\omega^2 + 2\). Then the product is 1 * (\(\omega^2 - 2\omega + 2\)) * (\(\omega - 2\omega^2 + 2\)). Let's compute this. Let me denote the two complex terms as A and B. A = \(\omega^2 - 2\omega + 2\), B = \(\omega - 2\omega^2 + 2\). Multiply A and B: (\(\omega^2 - 2\omega + 2\))(\(\omega - 2\omega^2 + 2\)). Let's expand this:

First, multiply \(\omega^2\) by each term in B: \(\omega^2 * \omega = \omega^3 = 1\), \(\omega^2 * (-2\omega^2) = -2\omega^4 = -2\omega\), \(\omega^2 * 2 = 2\omega^2\).

Then multiply -2\omega by each term in B: -2\omega * \omega = -2\omega^2, -2\omega * (-2\omega^2) = 4\omega^3 = 4*1 = 4, -2\omega * 2 = -4\omega.

Then multiply 2 by each term in B: 2 * \omega = 2\omega, 2 * (-2\omega^2) = -4\omega^2, 2 * 2 = 4.

Now add all these terms together:

1 -2\omega + 2\omega^2 -2\omega^2 + 4 -4\omega + 2\omega -4\omega^2 + 4.

Combine like terms:

Constants: 1 + 4 + 4 = 9.

\omega terms: -2\omega -4\omega + 2\omega = (-6\omega).

\omega^2 terms: 2\omega^2 -2\omega^2 -4\omega^2 = (-4\omega^2).

So total is 9 -6\omega -4\omega^2. But since \(\omega^2 = -1 - \omega\) (from the equation \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\)), substitute:

9 -6\omega -4(-1 - \omega) = 9 -6\omega +4 +4\omega = 13 -2\omega. Wait, but that's not a real number. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication.

Wait, let's check the multiplication again. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that in the 3rd roots case, the product should be 13, as per the formula. But according to the direct computation, the product is 13? Wait, but when I computed the product of A and B, I got 9 -6\omega -4\omega^2. Let me check again:

Wait, let's compute A*B:

A = \(\omega^2 - 2\omega + 2\)

B = \(\omega - 2\omega^2 + 2\)

Multiply term by term:

First term of A * first term of B: \(\omega^2 * \omega = \omega^3 = 1\)

First term of A * second term of B: \(\omega^2 * (-2\omega^2) = -2\omega^4 = -2\omega\)

First term of A * third term of B: \(\omega^2 * 2 = 2\omega^2\)

Second term of A * first term of B: (-2\omega) * \omega = -2\omega^2

Second term of A * second term of B: (-2\omega) * (-2\omega^2) = 4\omega^3 = 4

Second term of A * third term of B: (-2\omega) * 2 = -4\omega

Third term of A * first term of B: 2 * \omega = 2\omega

Third term of A * second term of B: 2 * (-2\omega^2) = -4\omega^2

Third term of A * third term of B: 2 * 2 = 4

Now adding all these:

1 (from first term) 

-2\omega (from first term) 

+2\omega^2 (from first term)

-2\omega^2 (from second term) 

+4 (from second term)

-4\omega (from second term)

+2\omega (from third term)

-4\omega^2 (from third term)

+4 (from third term)

Now combine like terms:

Constants: 1 + 4 + 4 = 9

\omega terms: -2\omega -4\omega +2\omega = (-6\omega)

\omega^2 terms: 2\omega^2 -2\omega^2 -4\omega^2 = (-4\omega^2)

So total: 9 -6\omega -4\omega^2.

But since \(\omega^2 = -1 - \omega\), substitute:

9 -6\omega -4(-1 - \omega) = 9 -6\omega +4 +4\omega = 13 -2\omega. Hmm, but this is a complex number. However, the original product should be a real number since the coefficients of P(x) are real. So maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Alternatively, perhaps I need to compute A*B correctly.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the expansion. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe the formula (a^{n} - 1)(b^{n} - 1) is correct, but in the 3rd root case, we have (a^3 - 1)(b^3 - 1) = ( (1 + i)^3 - 1 )( (1 - i)^3 - 1 ). Let's compute (1 + i)^3: as before, (1 + i)^3 = -2 - 2i. Then (1 + i)^3 -1 = -3 -2i. Similarly, (1 - i)^3 = -2 + 2i, so (1 - i)^3 -1 = -3 + 2i. Then the product is (-3 -2i)(-3 +2i) = 9 - (2i)^2 = 9 - (-4) = 13. So that's correct. Therefore, even though A*B seems complex, the product is real. So in the 3rd root case, the product is indeed 13, which matches the formula. Therefore, the formula seems valid. Therefore, returning to the original problem, the product should be (a^{13} -1)(b^{13} -1) where a and b are the roots of P(x) = x^2 -2x +2. So let's compute a and b.

Based on execution_2.1:
First, let's compute (1 + i)^{13}. To do this, we can use De Moivre's theorem. The complex number 1 + i has magnitude sqrt(2) and angle π/4. Therefore, (1 + i)^{13} = (sqrt(2))^{13} * e^{i * 13 * π/4}.

Let me compute 13π/4. Since 13 divided by 4 is 3 with remainder 1, so 13π/4 = 3π + π/4. But angles are modulo 2π, so 3π + π/4 = π/4 + 3π = π/4 + π + 2π = 5π/4 + 2π, but 5π/4 is equivalent to -3π/4. Wait, cos(13π/4) = cos(3π + π/4) = cos(π/4 + π + 2π) = cos(π/4 + π) = cos(5π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2. Similarly, sin(13π/4) = sin(π/4 + 3π) = sin(π/4 + π + 2π) = sin(5π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2. Wait, let me check:

First, sqrt(2) raised to the 13th power is (2^{1/2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^{6} * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).

The angle 13π/4 can be reduced by subtracting multiples of 2π. Since 2π is 8π/4, 13π/4 - 2π = 13π/4 - 8π/4 = 5π/4. So (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [cos(5π/4) + i sin(5π/4)]. Cos(5π/4) is -sqrt(2)/2, and sin(5π/4) is -sqrt(2)/2. Therefore, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 + i) = 64 * (-1) * (1 + i) = -64(1 + i). Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = -64(1 - i).

Therefore, (1 + i)^13 - 1 = -64(1 + i) - 1 = -64 - 64i - 1 = -65 - 64i. Similarly, (1 - i)^13 - 1 = -64(1 - i) - 1 = -64 + 64i - 1 = -65 + 64i.

Now, the product is (-65 - 64i)(-65 + 64i). Let's compute this. Using the formula (a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2, where a = -65, b = 64i. Wait, but here, the terms are (-65 - 64i)(-65 + 64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (64)^2 * i^2. Since i^2 = -1, this becomes 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.

<execution_3.2>
First, compute (sqrt(2))^{13} = (2)^{13/2} = 2^{6.5} = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 * sqrt(2). Then, 13π/4 is equivalent to 3π + π/4, which is in the third quadrant. The angle 13π/4 can be reduced by subtracting 2π (which is 8π/4) to get 13π/4 - 2π = 13π/4 - 8π/4 = 5π/4. So 13π/4 is coterminal with 5π/4. Therefore, cos(13π/4) = cos(5π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, and sin(13π/4) = sin(5π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2. Therefore, a^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} [ -sqrt(2)/2 + i*(-sqrt(2)/2 ) ] = (64 * sqrt(2)) * [ -sqrt(2)/2 - i*sqrt(2)/2 ].

Simplify this:

First, sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) = 2, so 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2)/2 = 64*(-1) = -64.

Similarly, the imaginary part: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) i = -64i. Therefore, a^13 = -64 -64i.

Similarly, b^13 = (1 - i)^13. Since 1 - i is the conjugate of 1 + i, its magnitude is also sqrt(2), and its angle is -π/4. Therefore, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} [cos(-13π/4) + i sin(-13π/4)]. Similarly, cos(-13π/4) = cos(13π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, and sin(-13π/4) = -sin(13π/4) = sqrt(2)/2. Therefore, b^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} [ -sqrt(2)/2 - i*sqrt(2)/2 ] = -64 -64i. Wait, but wait, let me check:

Wait, cos(-13π/4) = cos(13π/4) because cosine is even. Similarly, sin(-13π/4) = -sin(13π/4). So cos(-13π/4) = cos(13π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, and sin(-13π/4) = -sin(13π/4) = -(-sqrt(2)/2) = sqrt(2)/2. Wait, but 13π/4 is 3π + π/4, which is in the third quadrant, so sin(13π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2. Therefore, sin(-13π/4) = -sin(13π/4) = -(-sqrt(2)/2) = sqrt(2)/2. Therefore, b^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} [ -sqrt(2)/2 + i*sqrt(2)/2 ].

Compute this:

Real part: (sqrt(2))^{13} * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64*sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(-2)/2 = -64.

Imaginary part: (sqrt(2))^{13} * (sqrt(2)/2) i = 64*sqrt(2)*(sqrt(2)/2)i = 64*(2)/2 i = 64i.

Therefore, b^13 = -64 +64i.

13π/4 is equal to 3π + π/4. Since angles are periodic with period 2π, 13π/4 - 2π*1 = 13π/4 - 8π/4 = 5π/4. Therefore, cos(13π/4) = cos(5π/4) = -√2/2, and sin(13π/4) = sin(5π/4) = -√2/2. Similarly, for the angle -13π/4, which is the same as 5π/4 - 2π*2 = 5π/4 - 8π/4 = -3π/4. Wait, no. Wait, -13π/4 is equivalent to -13π/4 + 2π*2 = -13π/4 + 8π/4 = -5π/4. Which is the same as 3π/4 (since -5π/4 + 2π = 3π/4). Therefore, cos(-13π/4) = cos(3π/4) = -√2/2, and sin(-13π/4) = sin(3π/4) = √2/2. Wait, but actually, cos(-θ) = cosθ and sin(-θ) = -sinθ. So cos(-13π/4) = cos(13π/4) = -√2/2, and sin(-13π/4) = -sin(13π/4) = -(-√2/2) = √2/2. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me use the fact that cos is even and sin is odd. So cos(-θ) = cosθ, sin(-θ) = -sinθ.

So, cos(-13π/4) = cos(13π/4) = cos(5π/4) = -√2/2. sin(-13π/4) = -sin(13π/4) = -(-√2/2) = √2/2. Similarly, cos(13π/4) = cos(5π/4) = -√2/2, sin(13π/4) = sin(5π/4) = -√2/2.

Therefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} [cos(13π/4) + i sin(13π/4)] = (sqrt(2))^{13} [ -√2/2 + i (-√2/2) ] = (sqrt(2))^{13} [ -√2/2 - i√2/2 ].

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} [cos(-13π/4) + i sin(-13π/4)] = (sqrt(2))^{13} [ -√2/2 + i√2/2 ]. Wait, let me check:

Wait, cos(-13π/4) = cos(13π/4) = -√2/2. sin(-13π/4) = -sin(13π/4) = -(-√2/2) = √2/2. Therefore, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} [ -√2/2 + i√2/2 ].

Wait, but (1 - i) has magnitude sqrt(2) and angle -π/4. Therefore, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} e^{-i13π/4} = (sqrt(2))^{13} [cos(-13π/4) + i sin(-13π/4)] = (sqrt(2))^{13} [ -√2/2 + i√2/2 ].

First, note that (1 + i) = sqrt(2) e^{iπ/4}. Therefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 e^{i13π/4}. Let's compute (sqrt(2))^13. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2). So (sqrt(2))^13 = 64*sqrt(2).

The angle 13π/4 can be reduced modulo 2π. 13π/4 divided by 2π is 13/8, so 13π/4 - 2π*1 = 13π/4 - 8π/4 = 5π/4. So e^{i13π/4} = e^{i5π/4} = cos(5π/4) + i sin(5π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2. Therefore, (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 + i) = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) * (1 + i).

Compute 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2/2) = 64*(-1) = -64. Therefore, (1 + i)^13 = -64*(1 + i) = -64 -64i.

Similarly, (1 - i)^13. Since (1 - i) = sqrt(2) e^{-iπ/4}, so (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 e^{-i13π/4}. Following similar steps, 13π/4 is equivalent to 5π/4, so e^{-i13π/4} = e^{-i5π/4} = cos(5π/4) - i sin(5π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2. Therefore, (1 - i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 - i) = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) * (1 - i) = -64*(1 - i) = -64 + 64i.

Therefore, (1 + i)^13 -1 = (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i, and (1 - i)^13 -1 = (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i.

Now, the product is (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i). Let's compute this. Using the formula (a + b)(a - b) = a² - b², where a = -65 and b = 64i. Therefore, (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096 * i²) = 4225 - (4096 * (-1)) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.

Wait, but let me check that again. Alternatively, multiply directly:

(-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)(-65) + (-65)(64i) + (-64i)(-65) + (-64i)(64i)

= 4225 - 4160i + 4160i - 4096i²

= 4225 - 4096(-1) [since i² = -1]

= 4225 + 4096 = 8321.

So the product is 8321. Then the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 is 321, since 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with remainder 321.

Wait, but in the original problem, the answer is 8321 mod 1000, which is 321. However, I need to confirm this because in the 3rd root case, the answer was 13, and in the 2nd root case, it was 5. So here, 8321 mod 1000 is 321. But let me check if I made any mistakes in the calculation.

First, let's verify (1 + i)^13. Let's compute (1 + i)^2 = 2i, (1 + i)^4 = (2i)^2 = -4, (1 + i)^8 = (-4)^2 = 16, (1 + i)^12 = (1 + i)^8 * (1 + i)^4 = 16 * (-4) = -64, (1 + i)^13 = (1 + i)^12 * (1 + i) = -64*(1 + i) = -64 -64i. Correct. Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = -64*(1 - i) = -64 +64i. Then subtracting 1 gives -65 -64i and -65 +64i. Multiplying these gives (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (-4096) = 4225 +4096 = 8321. Correct. Therefore, 8321 mod 1000 is 321. So the remainder is 321.

Let's expand this product:

= C^2 e^{i13π/4} e^{-i13π/4} - C e^{i13π/4} - C e^{-i13π/4} + 1

= C^2 e^{0} - C (e^{i13π/4} + e^{-i13π/4}) + 1

Since e^{iθ} + e^{-iθ} = 2 cos θ, this becomes:

= C^2 - 2C cos(13π/4) + 1

Now, compute cos(13π/4). Let's reduce 13π/4 modulo 2π. 13π/4 - 2π = 13π/4 - 8π/4 = 5π/4. So cos(13π/4) = cos(5π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2. Therefore:

= C^2 - 2C (-sqrt(2)/2) + 1

= C^2 + C sqrt(2) + 1

Now, C = (sqrt(2))^13. Let's compute C:

(sqrt(2))^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2). Therefore, C = 64 sqrt(2).

Substitute back:

= (64 sqrt(2))^2 + 64 sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) + 1

Compute each term:

(64 sqrt(2))^2 = 64^2 * (sqrt(2))^2 = 4096 * 2 = 8192

64 sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) = 64 * 2 = 128

Therefore, the product is 8192 + 128 + 1 = 8192 + 128 = 8320; 8320 +1 = 8321.

So the product is 8321. Therefore, the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 is 8321 - 8*1000 = 8321 - 8000 = 321. So the remainder is 321.

Since 1 + i is sqrt(2) e^{iπ/4}, raising to the 13th power gives (sqrt(2))^13 e^{i13π/4}. Let's compute that.

First, (sqrt(2))^13 = (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).

Next, 13π/4 radians. Since 2π is a full circle, 13π/4 - 2π = 13π/4 - 8π/4 = 5π/4. So 13π/4 is equivalent to 5π/4 in terms of the unit circle. So e^{i13π/4} = e^{i5π/4} = cos(5π/4) + i sin(5π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2. Therefore, (sqrt(2))^13 e^{i13π/4} = 64*sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2)(1 + i) = 64*(-1/2)(1 + i) = -32(1 + i).

Therefore, (1 + i)^13 = -32(1 + i). Then (1 + i)^13 - 1 = -32(1 + i) - 1 = -32 -32i -1 = -33 -32i.

Similarly, (1 - i)^13: since 1 - i is sqrt(2) e^{-iπ/4}, raising to the 13th power gives (sqrt(2))^13 e^{-i13π/4} = 64*sqrt(2)*(cos(-13π/4) + i sin(-13π/4)). Again, 13π/4 is equivalent to 5π/4, so -13π/4 is equivalent to -5π/4, which is the same as 3π/4 (since -5π/4 + 2π = 3π/4). So cos(-13π/4) = cos(3π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, and sin(-13π/4) = sin(3π/4) = sqrt(2)/2. Wait, no: sin(-θ) = -sinθ. So sin(-13π/4) = -sin(13π/4) = -(-sqrt(2)/2) = sqrt(2)/2. Wait, this is confusing. Let me compute it step by step.

First, -13π/4 is the angle. Let's add 2π to it to get a positive angle: -13π/4 + 2π = -13π/4 + 8π/4 = -5π/4. Then add another 2π: -5π/4 + 8π/4 = 3π/4. So -13π/4 is equivalent to 3π/4 in terms of the unit circle. Therefore, cos(-13π/4) = cos(3π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, and sin(-13π/4) = sin(3π/4) = sqrt(2)/2. Wait, no: sin(-13π/4) = sin(-13π/4 + 2π) = sin(-13π/4 + 8π/4) = sin(-5π/4) = sin(5π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2. Wait, this is getting messy. Alternatively, just compute e^{-i13π/4}:

e^{-i13π/4} = cos(13π/4) - i sin(13π/4). But 13π/4 = 3π + π/4, so cos(13π/4) = cos(3π + π/4) = cos(π + 2π + π/4) = cos(π + π/4) = -cos(π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2. Similarly, sin(13π/4) = sin(3π + π/4) = sin(π + π/4) = -sin(π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2. Therefore, e^{-i13π/4} = -sqrt(2)/2 - i(-sqrt(2)/2) = -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ. So if θ = 13π/4, then cosθ = -sqrt(2)/2, sinθ = -sqrt(2)/2. Therefore, e^{-iθ} = -sqrt(2)/2 - i*(-sqrt(2)/2) = -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2. Therefore, (sqrt(2))^13 e^{-i13π/4} = 64*sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2)(1 - i) = 64*(-1/2)(1 - i) = -32(1 - i). Therefore, (1 - i)^13 = -32(1 - i). Then (1 - i)^13 - 1 = -32(1 - i) - 1 = -32 + 32i -1 = -33 + 32i.

Therefore, the two terms are -33 -32i and -33 +32i. Multiplying them together:

(-33 -32i)(-33 +32i) = (-33)^2 - (32i)^2 = 1089 - (1024*(-1)) = 1089 + 1024 = 2113.

Wait, but that's a real number. Wait, but that's the same as before. Wait, but according to the formula, the product should be (a^{13} -1)(b^{13} -1) = (-33 -32i)(-33 +32i) = (-33)^2 - (32i)^2 = 1089 - (-1024) = 1089 + 1024 = 2113. So the product is 2113. Then the remainder when 2113 is divided by 1000 is 113. Therefore, the answer is 113.

But wait, let me check again. Because when I computed the product of (1 + i)^13 -1 and (1 - i)^13 -1, I got -33 -32i and -33 +32i, whose product is (-33)^2 + (32)^2 = 1089 + 1024 = 2113. Therefore, yes, 2113 mod 1000 is 113. Therefore, the remainder is 113.

(1 + i)^4 = (-2 + 2i)(1 + i) = -2(1 + i) + 2i(1 + i) = -2 - 2i + 2i + 2i^2 = -2 + 0i - 2 = -4

(1 + i)^4 = -4

(1 + i)^5 = (1 + i)^4 * (1 + i) = -4*(1 + i) = -4 -4i

(1 + i)^6 = (1 + i)^5 * (1 + i) = (-4 -4i)(1 + i) = -4(1 + i) -4i(1 + i) = -4 -4i -4i -4i^2 = -4 -8i +4 = 0 -8i = -8i

(1 + i)^7 = (1 + i)^6 * (1 + i) = -8i*(1 + i) = -8i -8i^2 = -8i +8 = 8 -8i

(1 + i)^8 = (1 + i)^7 * (1 + i) = (8 -8i)(1 + i) = 8(1 + i) -8i(1 + i) = 8 +8i -8i -8i^2 = 8 +0i +8 = 16

(1 + i)^8 = 16

(1 + i)^9 = (1 + i)^8 * (1 + i) = 16*(1 + i) = 16 +16i

(1 + i)^10 = (1 + i)^9 * (1 + i) = (16 +16i)(1 + i) = 16(1 + i) +16i(1 + i) = 16 +16i +16i +16i^2 = 16 +32i -16 = 0 +32i = 32i

(1 + i)^11 = (1 + i)^10 * (1 + i) = 32i*(1 + i) = 32i +32i^2 = 32i -32 = -32 +32i

(1 + i)^12 = (1 + i)^11 * (1 + i) = (-32 +32i)(1 + i) = -32(1 + i) +32i(1 + i) = -32 -32i +32i +32i^2 = -32 +0i -32 = -64

(1 + i)^13 = (1 + i)^12 * (1 + i) = -64*(1 + i) = -64 -64i

So (1 + i)^13 = -64 -64i. Therefore, (1 + i)^13 -1 = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i.

Similarly, (1 - i)^13:

(1 - i)^1 = 1 - i

(1 - i)^2 = 1 - 2i + i^2 = 1 -2i -1 = -2i

(1 - i)^3 = (1 - i)(-2i) = -2i + 2i^2 = -2i -2 = -2 -2i

(1 - i)^8=16

(1 - i)^9=(1 - i)^8*(1 - i)=16*(1 - i)=16 -16i

(1 - i)^11=(1 - i)^10*(1 - i)=(-32i)(1 - i)= -32i +32i^2= -32i -32= -32 -32i

(1 - i)^12=(1 - i)^11*(1 - i)=(-32 -32i)(1 - i)= -32(1 - i) -32i(1 - i)= -32 +32i -32i +32i^2= -32 +0i -32= -64

(1 - i)^13=(1 - i)^12*(1 - i)= -64*(1 - i)= -64 +64i

Therefore, (1 - i)^13 = -64 +64i. Hence, (1 - i)^13 -1 = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i.

Therefore, the product is (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i). Let's compute this:

Multiply using (a - b)(a + b) = a^2 - b^2, where a = -65, b =64i.

Wait, but actually, (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (64^2)(i^2) = 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 +4096 = 8321.

Wait, let me check that:

First, (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 + (64)^2, since (a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2 when b is imaginary. Wait, actually, no. Let me compute it step by step:

(-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)(-65) + (-65)(64i) + (-64i)(-65) + (-64i)(64i)

= 4225 -4160i +4160i -4096i^2

= 4225 + 0i -4096(-1)

= 4225 +4096

= 8321.

Yes, that's correct. So the product is 8321. Therefore, the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 is 321.
