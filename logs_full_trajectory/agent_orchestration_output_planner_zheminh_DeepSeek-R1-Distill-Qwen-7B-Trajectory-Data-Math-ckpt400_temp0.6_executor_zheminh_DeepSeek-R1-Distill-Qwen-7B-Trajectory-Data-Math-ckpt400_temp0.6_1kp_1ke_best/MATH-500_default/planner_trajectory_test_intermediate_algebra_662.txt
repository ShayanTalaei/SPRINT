<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to find the real roots of this equation. Let me first write it down clearly to make sure I have it right.
The equation is:

[(x + 1)(x - 3)] / [5(x + 2)(x - 4)] + [(x + 3)(x - 5)] / [9(x + 4)(x - 6)] - [2(x + 5)(x - 7)] / [13(x + 6)(x - 8)] = 92/585.

Hmm, that's a bit complex with three rational expressions added and subtracted, each with quadratic numerators and denominators. The right-hand side is a fraction, 92/585. I need to find the real values of x that satisfy this equation.

First, I should note the denominators to check for points where the expression is undefined.
The denominators are 5(x + 2)(x - 4), 9(x + 4)(x - 6), and 13(x + 6)(x - 8). So, the expression is undefined when any of the denominators are zero. That happens at x = -6, -4, -2, 4, 6, 8. So, these are vertical asymptotes or points of discontinuity. Therefore, the domain of the function is all real numbers except x ≠ -6, -4, -2, 4, 6, 8. So, I need to keep these points in mind; solutions can't be any of these values.

Now, the equation is a sum of three rational functions equals 92/585. Solving such equations can be tricky because combining the fractions might lead to a high-degree polynomial, which could be difficult to solve. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a value of x that makes each term simplify nicely? Let me check if plugging in some of the excluded values might make the equation hold, but since the function is undefined there, they can't be roots. However, maybe values close to those points? But since the roots must be in the domain, maybe the roots are among integers or simple fractions. Let me check possible integer values first.

Let me test x = 0. Let's compute each term:

<prompt_1.1> Calculate the left-hand side of the equation for x = 0 and compare it to the right-hand side. </prompt_1.1>

How about x = 1:

<prompt_1.2> Calculate the left-hand side of the equation for x = 1 and compare it to the right-hand side. </prompt_1.2>

How about x = 2:

<prompt_1.3> Calculate the left-hand side of the equation for x = 2 and compare it to the right-hand side. </prompt_1.3>

x = 3:

<prompt_1.4> Calculate the left-hand side of the equation for x = 3 and compare it to the right-hand side. </prompt_1.4>

x = 5:

<prompt_1.5> Calculate the left-hand side of the equation for x = 5 and compare it to the right-hand side. </prompt_1.5>

x = 7:

<prompt_1.6> Calculate the left-hand side of the equation for x = 7 and compare it to the right-hand side. </prompt_1.6>

First term: [(0 + 1)(0 - 3)] / [5(0 + 2)(0 - 4)] = (1 * -3)/(5 * 2 * -4) = (-3)/(5 * -8) = (-3)/(-40) = 3/40.

Second term: [(0 + 3)(0 - 5)] / [9(0 + 4)(0 - 6)] = (3 * -5)/(9 * 4 * -6) = (-15)/(9 * -24) = (-15)/(-216) = 15/216 = 5/72.

Third term: -2[(0 + 5)(0 - 7)] / [13(0 + 6)(0 - 8)] = -2*(5*-7)/(13*6*-8) = -2*(-35)/(13*-48) = -2*(35)/(13*48) because the negatives cancel? Wait, let me compute step by step.

First, compute numerator: (5)(-7) = -35. Multiply by -2: -2*(-35) = 70.

Denominator: 13*(6)*(-8) = 13*(-48) = -624.

So, the third term is 70 / (-624) = -70/624 = -35/312 ≈ -0.112.

Adding all three terms: 3/40 + 5/72 - 35/312. Let me convert to decimal for easier comparison.

3/40 = 0.075; 5/72 ≈ 0.0694; 35/312 ≈ 0.112. So, 0.075 + 0.0694 - 0.112 ≈ 0.0324. The right-hand side is 92/585 ≈ 0.157. So, not equal.

First term: [(0 + 1)(0 - 3)] / [5(0 + 2)(0 - 4)] = (1 * -3)/(5 * 2 * -4) = (-3)/(-40) = 3/40.

Second term: [(0 + 3)(0 - 5)] / [9(0 + 4)(0 - 6)] = (3 * -5)/(9 * 4 * -6) = (-15)/(-216) = 15/216 = 5/72.

Third term: -2[(0 + 5)(0 - 7)] / [13(0 + 6)(0 - 8)] = -2*(5*-7)/(13*6*-8) = -2*(-35)/(-624) = -2*(35)/624 = -70/624 = -35/312.

Adding them up: 3/40 + 5/72 - 35/312. Let's convert to common denominator. Let's see, 40, 72, 312. LCM of 40 and 72 is 360. Then LCM of 360 and 312. Let's see, 360 factors into 2^3*3^2*5, 312 is 8*39=8*3*13, so LCM is 2^3*3^2*5*13= 8*9*5*13= 360*65=23400. That's a big denominator. Alternatively, maybe decimal approximation.

3/40 = 0.075, 5/72 ≈ 0.0694, 35/312 ≈ 0.1121. So, 0.075 + 0.0694 - 0.1121 ≈ 0.0323. The right-hand side is 92/585 ≈ 0.1573. So, not equal. So, x=0 is not a root.

First term: [(0 + 1)(0 - 3)] / [5(0 + 2)(0 - 4)] = (1*(-3))/(5*2*(-4)) = (-3)/(-40) = 3/40.

Second term: [(0 + 3)(0 - 5)] / [9(0 + 4)(0 - 6)] = (3*(-5))/(9*4*(-6)) = (-15)/(-216) = 15/216 = 5/72.

Third term: -2[(0 + 5)(0 - 7)] / [13(0 + 6)(0 - 8)] = -2*(5*(-7))/(13*6*(-8)) = -2*(-35)/(-624) = -2*(245)/624? Wait, let me compute step by step.

First, the numerator inside: (5)(-7) = -35. Then multiplied by 2: -2*35 = -70.

Denominator: 13*6*(-8) = 13*(-48) = -624.

So, the third term is -70 / (-624) = 70/624 = 35/312 ≈ 0.112.

Adding all three terms: 3/40 + 5/72 + 35/312. Let's convert to common denominator. Let's see, 40, 72, 312. LCM of 40 and 72 is 360, then LCM of 360 and 312. Let's see, 360 factors into 2^3*3^2*5, 312 is 8*39=8*3*13, so LCM is 2^3*3^2*5*13= 8*9*5*13= 8*9=72, 72*5=360, 360*13=4680. So common denominator is 4680.

3/40 = (3*117)/4680 = 351/4680

5/72 = (5*65)/4680 = 325/4680

35/312 = (35*15)/4680 = 525/4680

Adding up: 351 + 325 + 525 = 1201. So total is 1201/4680 ≈ 0.257.

But the right-hand side is 92/585 ≈ 0.157. So not equal.

First term: [(1 + 1)(1 - 3)]/[5(1 + 2)(1 - 4)] = (2*(-2))/(5*3*(-3)) = (-4)/(-45) = 4/45 ≈ 0.0889.

Second term: [(1 + 3)(1 - 5)]/[9(1 + 4)(1 - 6)] = (4*(-4))/(9*5*(-5)) = (-16)/(-225) = 16/225 ≈ 0.0711.

Third term: -2[(1 + 5)(1 - 7)]/[13(1 + 6)(1 - 8)] = -2[6*(-6)]/[13*7*(-7)] = -2*(-36)/(-91* -7). Wait, let me compute step by step.

First, numerator: (6)(-6) = -36. Multiply by 2: -2*(-36) = +72.

Denominator: 13*(7)*(-7) = 13*(-49) = -637.

So, third term is 72/-637 ≈ -0.1121.

Adding all three terms: 4/45 + 16/225 - 72/637 ≈ 0.0889 + 0.0711 - 0.1121 ≈ 0.0479. Compare to 92/585 ≈ 0.157. Not close.

Wait, x=5 was already checked. Let's try x=7:

First term: (7+1)(7-3)/[5(7+2)(7-4)] = 8*4 / [5*9*3] = 32 / 135.

Second term: (7+3)(7-5)/[9(7+4)(7-6)] = 10*2 / [9*11*1] = 20 / 99.

Third term: 2*(7+5)(7-7)/[13(7+6)(7-8)] = 2*12*0 / [13*13*(-1)] = 0.

So sum is 32/135 + 20/99. Let's compute:

32/135 ≈ 0.237, 20/99 ≈ 0.202. Sum ≈ 0.439. 92/585 ≈ 0.157. Not equal.
</execution_1.5>

<execution_1.6>
Wait, the denominators at x=7: first term denominator is 5(9)(3) = 135, second term denominator is 9(11)(1) = 99, third term denominator is 13(13)(-1) = -169. So denominators are non-zero. Let's compute each term:

First term: [(8)(4)] / [5(9)(3)] = 32 / 135 ≈ 0.237.

Second term: [(10)(2)] / [9(11)(1)] = 20 / 99 ≈ 0.202.

Third term: -2[(12)(0)] / [13(13)(-1)] = -2*0 / (-169) = 0.

So total LHS ≈ 0.237 + 0.202 ≈ 0.439. RHS is 92/585 ≈ 0.157. Not equal.

So, close but not exact. Maybe there's a root between x=12 and x=11? Alternatively, perhaps x= -4? Wait, x=-4 is excluded, so can't be. How about x= -3?

<prompt_4.1> Use the Newton-Raphson method to approximate the root between x = 12 and x = 11. </prompt_4.1>

Wait, denominator has (x +4), so x=-4 is excluded. x=-3 is allowed? Let's check. x=-3: denominators:

First denominator: x+2= -1, x-4= -7, so okay. Second denominator: x+4=1, x-6= -9, okay. Third denominator: x+6=3, x-8= -11, okay. So x=-3 is allowed.

Let me compute x=-3:

First term: (-3+1)(-3-3)/[5(-3+2)(-3-4)] = (-2)(-6)/[5*(-1)(-7)] = 12/(35) ≈ 0.3429.

Second term: (-3+3)(-3-5)/[9(-3+4)(-3-6)] = (0)(-8)/[9*(1)(-9)] = 0.

Third term: -2[(-3+5)(-3-7)]/[13(-3+6)(-3-8)] = -2*(2*(-10))/(13*3*(-11)) = -2*(-20)/(-399) = -2*(-20)/(-399) = -40/399 ≈ -0.1003.

Sum: 0.3429 + 0 -0.1003 ≈ 0.2426. Not equal to 0.157. So, maybe not.

Alternatively, maybe x= -2. Let's check x=-2:

First term denominator is zero, so x=-2 is excluded. So skip.

How about x= -1:

First denominator: x+2=1, okay. Second denominator: x+4=3, x-6= -7, okay. Third denominator: x+6=5, x-8= -9, okay. So x=-1 is allowed.

Compute x=-1:

First term: (-1+1)(-1-3)/[5(-1+2)(-1-4)] = (0)(-4)/[5*(1)(-5)] = 0.

Second term: (-1+3)(-1-5)/[9(-1+4)(-1-6)] = (2)(-6)/[9*(3)(-7)] = (-12)/(-189) = 12/189 = 4/63 ≈ 0.0635.

Third term: -2[(-1+5)(-1-7)]/[13(-1+6)(-1-8)] = -2*(4*(-8))/(13*5*(-9)) = -2*(-32)/(-585) = -2*(32)/585 ≈ -0.1093.

Maybe there's a mistake in my approach. Let me check the original equation again.

Wait, the original equation is:

[(x+1)(x-3)]/[5(x+2)(x-4)] + [(x+3)(x-5)]/[9(x+4)(x-6)] - 2[(x+5)(x-7)]/[13(x+6)(x-8)] = 92/585.

Wait, perhaps instead of plugging in values, I can combine the fractions. Let me see. The denominators are 5(x+2)(x-4), 9(x+3)(x-6), and 13(x+5)(x-7). Wait, actually, denominators are:

First term: 5(x + 2)(x - 4)

Second term: 9(x + 3)(x - 5)

Third term: 13(x + 6)(x - 8)

Wait, no. Wait, the third term is 2*(x+5)(x-7)/[13(x+6)(x-8)]. So denominators are:

First: 5(x+2)(x-4)

Second: 9(x+3)(x-5)

Third: 13(x+6)(x-8)

So, denominators are different. Therefore, combining them would require a common denominator of 5*9*13*(x+2)(x-4)(x+3)(x-5)(x+6)(x-8). That seems very complicated, but perhaps necessary.

Alternatively, maybe cross-multiplying and bringing all terms to one side to form a single rational equation. Let me attempt that.

<prompt_5.1> Cross-multiply and simplify the equation to find the numerator. </prompt_5.1>
</Plan_5>

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
Let me denote the left-hand side as LHS. So:

LHS = [ (x+1)(x-3) ] / [5(x+2)(x-4) ] + [ (x+3)(x-5) ] / [9(x+3)(x-5) ] - [ 2(x+5)(x-7) ] / [13(x+6)(x-8) ] - 92/585 = 0.

To combine all terms, find a common denominator. Let's compute the denominators:

Denominator1: 5(x+2)(x-4)

Denominator2: 9(x+3)(x-5)

Denominator3: 13(x+6)(x-8)

So, the common denominator (LCD) would be the product of all distinct factors: 5*9*13*(x+2)(x+3)(x+4)(x+5)(x+6)(x-4)(x-5)(x-6)(x-7)(x-8). Wait, but actually, each denominator already includes some factors. Wait, actually, Denominator1 has (x+2), (x-4); Denominator2 has (x+3), (x-5); Denominator3 has (x+6), (x-8). So, the LCD would be 5*9*13*(x+2)(x+3)(x+4)(x+5)(x+6)(x-4)(x-5)(x-8). Because:

- For constants: 5, 9, 13.

- For linear factors:

From Denominator1: (x+2), (x-4)

From Denominator2: (x+3), (x-5)

From Denominator3: (x+6), (x-8)

Therefore, LCD = 5*9*13*(x+2)(x+3)(x+4)(x+5)(x+6)(x-4)(x-5)(x-8).

But that's a very high degree polynomial. Multiplying everything out would be tedious, but maybe we can proceed step by step.

First, multiply both sides by the LCD to eliminate denominators:

LCD * [LHS - 92/585] = 0.

But maybe it's better to bring all terms to one side:

LHS - 92/585 = 0.

Multiply both sides by LCD:

LCD * LHS - LCD * (92/585) = 0.

Compute each term:

First term: [ (x+1)(x-3) / (5(x+2)(x-4)) ] * LCD = (x+1)(x-3) * [ LCD / (5(x+2)(x-4)) ] = (x+1)(x-3) * [ 9*13*(x+3)(x-5)(x+6)(x-8) ].

Similarly, second term: [ (x+3)(x-5) / (9(x+3)(x-5)) ] * LCD = (x+3)(x-5) * [ LCD / (9(x+3)(x-5)) ] = (x+1)(x-3) * [ 5*13*(x+2)(x-4)(x+6)(x-8) ].

Third term: [ 2(x+5)(x-7) / (13(x+6)(x-8)) ] * LCD = 2(x+5)(x-7) * [ LCD / (13(x+6)(x-8)) ] = 2(x+5)(x-7) * [5*9*(x+2)(x+3)(x+4)(x+5) ].

Wait, perhaps this approach is too cumbersome. Let me check if there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, perhaps cross-multiplying each term step by step.

But given the complexity, maybe there's a smarter substitution or factorization.

Alternatively, perhaps noticing that the equation is a rational function set to a constant, and the left-hand side is a sum of three rational functions. Maybe the equation can be transformed into a polynomial equation by multiplying both sides by the common denominator.

Let me attempt that.

Let me denote the denominators as follows:

<prompt_6.1> Multiply both sides by the common denominator and simplify the equation. </prompt_6.1>

<Execution_6>
<execution_6.1>
D1 = 5(x + 2)(x - 4)

D2 = 9(x + 3)(x - 5)

D3 = 13(x + 6)(x - 8)

The common denominator LCD = D1 * D2 * D3 / (gcds). However, since the denominators share no common factors (as established earlier), LCD = D1 * D2 * D3.

Thus, multiplying both sides by LCD:

[(x + 1)(x - 3) * D2 * D3] / [5(x + 2)(x - 4)] + [(x + 3)(x - 5) * D1 * D3] / [9(x + 3)(x - 5)] - [2(x + 5)(x - 7) * D1 * D2] / [13(x + 6)(x - 8)] = (92/585) * LCD.

Simplifying each term:

First term: [(x + 1)(x - 3)] / [5(x + 2)(x - 4)] * D2 * D3 = [(x + 1)(x - 3)] / [5(x + 2)(x - 4)] * [9(x + 3)(x - 5)][13(x + 6)(x - 8)].

This simplifies to: [(x + 1)(x - 3) * 9 * 13 * (x + 3)(x - 5)(x + 6)(x - 8)] / [5(x + 2)(x - 4)].

Similarly, the second term: [(x + 3)(x - 5)] / [9(x + 3)(x - 5)] * D1 * D3 = [1/9] * D1 * D3 = [1/9] * 5(x + 2)(x - 4) * 13(x + 6)(x - 8).

Third term: - [2(x + 5)(x - 7)] / [13(x + 6)(x - 8)] * D1 * D2 = - [2(x + 5)(x - 7) / 13(x + 6)(x - 8)] * 5(x + 2)(x - 4) * 9(x + 3)(x - 5).

This simplifies to: - [2(x + 5)(x - 7) * 5 * 9 * (x + 2)(x - 4)(x + 3)(x - 5)] / [13(x + 6)(x - 8)].

The right-hand side becomes: (92/585) * D1 * D2 * D3.

Based on execution_6.1:
This seems extremely complex. Maybe expanding all terms is not feasible. Alternatively, perhaps there's a substitution or factorization that can simplify the equation. Let me check if the numerators can be factored or related to the denominators.

Alternatively, perhaps cross-multiplying step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps moving all terms to the left-hand side and combining them, but given the complexity, perhaps it's better to consider if there's a pattern or if the equation can be transformed into a polynomial equation.

Alternatively, perhaps substituting specific values for x that simplify the equation. For example, if x is such that one of the terms becomes zero. Let's see:

First term numerator: (x+1)(x-3). If x = -1 or x=3, this term is zero.

Second term numerator: (x+3)(x-5). If x = -3 or x=5, this term is zero.

Third term numerator: (x+5)(x-7). If x = -5 or x=7, this term is zero.

However, x=-3, -2, -4, 4,6,8 are excluded. So, x=-1,3,5,7 might be candidates. Let's check x=3:

x=3:

First term: 0.

Second term: (6)(-2)/[9(8)(-3)] = (-12)/(-216) = 1/18 ≈0.0556.

Third term: -2[(8)(-4)]/[13(9)(-5)] = -2*(-32)/(-585) = -64/585 ≈-0.1093.

Sum: ≈0.0556 -0.1093 ≈ -0.0537. Not equal to 92/585≈0.157.

x=5:

First term: (6)(2)/(7*3) = 12/21≈0.571.

Second term: 0.

Third term: -2[(10)(-3)]/[13(11)(-3)] = -2*(-30)/(-429) = -60/429≈-0.1399.

Sum≈0.571 -0.1399≈0.431. Not equal.

x=7:

First term: (8)(4)/(9*5)=32/45≈0.711.

Second term: (10)(2)/(9*8)=20/72≈0.277.

Third term:0.

Sum≈0.711+0.277≈0.988. Not equal.

Alternatively, maybe x= -1,3,5,7 are not roots. How about x= -5:

First term: (-4)(-8)/[5(-3)(-9)] = 32/135≈0.237.

Second term: (-2)(-10)/[9(-2)(-12)] = 20/216≈0.0926.

Third term:0.

Sum≈0.237+0.0926≈0.329. Not equal.

Based on execution_7.1:
Alternatively, maybe cross-multiplying each term to the other side step by step.

<prompt_8.1> Re-evaluate and simplify the equation after cross-multiplying. </prompt_8.1>

<Execution_8>
<execution_8.1>
But this might not necessarily simplify things.

Alternatively, perhaps considering that 585 = 5*117=5*9*13. So 585=5*9*13. So 92/585=92/(5*9*13). Maybe this can be useful later.

Alternatively, maybe moving all terms to left-hand side and setting to zero, then multiplying both sides by the common denominator to eliminate denominators. Let's try that.

So:

[First term] + [Second term] - [Third term] - 92/585 = 0.

Multiply both sides by LCD = 5*9*13*(x+2)(x+3)(x+4)(x+5)(x+6)(x-4)(x-5)(x-8).

Thus:

9*13*(x+3)(x-5)(x+6)(x-8)*(x+1)(x-3) + 5*13*(x+2)(x-4)(x+6)(x-8)*(x+3)(x-5) -5*9*(x+2)(x+3)(x+4)(x+5)*(x+5)(x-7)*(x+6)(x-8)/13 - 92/585 * LCD =0.

Wait, this seems too complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, perhaps note that the equation is a sum of three rational functions equal to a constant. Maybe graphing each term or analyzing their behavior. However, since this is a text-based problem, perhaps there's a trick.

Alternatively, maybe the equation can be transformed by multiplying numerator and denominator to make the equation polynomial. Let me attempt to write the equation as:

[(x+1)(x-3)/A] + [(x+3)(x-5)/B] - [2(x+5)(x-7)/C] = 92/585,

where A=5(x+2)(x-4), B=9(x+3)(x-5), C=13(x+6)(x-8). Then, multiply both sides by 5*9*13*(x+2)(x+3)(x+4)(x+5)(x+6)(x-4)(x-5)(x-8) to eliminate denominators.

But this would result in a high-degree polynomial equation. However, perhaps expanding and simplifying would lead to a solvable equation.

Given the complexity, perhaps the problem is designed such that after expanding, terms cancel out, leading to a solvable equation. However, given the time constraints, maybe it's better to consider if there's a pattern or if the equation can be factored.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a symmetry or substitution that can simplify the equation. For example, substituting y = x + a for some a. But without seeing a clear path, this might not be helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps noticing that the denominators are structured such that each has two linear factors, and the numerators are products of two linear factors. Maybe there's a relation between numerators and denominators. For example, in the first term, (x+1)(x-3) over (x+2)(x-4). Maybe writing (x+1)(x-3) = [(x+2)-1][(x-4)+1]. Let's compute:

(x+1)(x-3) = (x+2 -1)(x-4 +1) = (x+2)(x-4) + (x+2)(1) -1*(x-4) -1*1 = (x+2)(x-4) + (x+2) - (x-4) -1 = (x+2)(x-4) + x +2 -x +4 -1 = (x+2)(x-4) +5.

So, (x+1)(x-3) = (x+2)(x-4) +5.

Therefore, the first term can be written as [ (x+2)(x-4) +5 ] / [5(x+2)(x-4) ] = 1/5 + 5/[5(x+2)(x-4)] = 1/5 + 1/[ (x+2)(x-4) ].

Similarly, perhaps this can help in simplifying.

Let me rewrite each term using this approach.

First term:

[(x+1)(x-3)]/[5(x+2)(x-4)] = [ (x+2)(x-4) +5 ]/[5(x+2)(x-4)] = [ (x+2)(x-4) / (5(x+2)(x-4)) ) + 5/(5(x+2)(x-4)) ] = 1/5 + 1/[ (x+2)(x-4) ].

Similarly, second term:

[(x+3)(x-5)]/[9(x+3)(x-5)] = [ (x+3)(x-5) ]/[9(x+3)(x-5)] = 1/9, provided that (x+3)(x-5) ≠0, which is already handled by the domain restrictions.

Third term:

-2[(x+5)(x-7)]/[13(x+6)(x-8)] = -2[ (x+6 -1)(x-8 +1) ]/[13(x+6)(x-8)].

Let me expand (x+5)(x-7):

(x+5)(x-7) = x² -7x +5x -35 = x² -2x -35.

Alternatively, perhaps using the same technique as before:

(x+5)(x-7) = (x+6 -1)(x-8 +1) = (x+6)(x-8) + (x+6)(1) -1*(x-8) -1*1 = (x+6)(x-8) + (x+6) - (x-8) -1 = (x+6)(x-8) + x +6 -x +8 -1 = (x+6)(x-8) +13.

Therefore, (x+5)(x-7) = (x+6)(x-8) +13.

Therefore, third term becomes:

-2[ (x+6)(x-8) +13 ]/[13(x+6)(x-8)] = -2/[13(x+6)(x-8)] * [ (x+6)(x-8) +13 ] = -2/[13(x+6)(x-8)] * (x+6)(x-8) -2/[13(x+6)(x-8)] *13 = -2/13 -26/[13(x+6)(x-8)] = -2/13 -2/[ (x+6)(x-8) ].

Therefore, combining all three terms:

First term: 1/5 + 1/[ (x+2)(x-4) ]

Second term: 1/9

Third term: -2/13 -2/[ (x+6)(x-8) ]

So total LHS:

1/5 + 1/[ (x+2)(x-4) ] +1/9 -2/13 -2/[ (x+6)(x-8) ].

Combine constants:

1/5 +1/9 -2/13.

Let me compute this:

Compute 1/5 +1/9 = (9 +5)/45 =14/45.

14/45 -2/13 = (14*13 -2*45)/(45*13) = (182 -90)/585 =92/585.

So the constants sum up to 92/585. Then, the variable terms are:

1/[ (x+2)(x-4) ] -2/[ (x+6)(x-8) ].

Therefore, the entire equation becomes:

92/585 + [1/( (x+2)(x-4) ) - 2/( (x+6)(x-8) ) ] = 92/585.

Subtracting 92/585 from both sides:

[1/( (x+2)(x-4) ) - 2/( (x+6)(x-8) ) ] = 0.

Therefore, the equation simplifies to:

1/[ (x+2)(x-4) ] = 2/[ (x+6)(x-8) ].

Wow! That's a significant simplification. So, after rewriting each term, the equation reduces to:

1/[ (x+2)(x-4) ] - 2/[ (x+6)(x-8) ] = 0.

So, 1/[ (x+2)(x-4) ] = 2/[ (x+6)(x-8) ].

Now, solving this equation:

1/[ (x+2)(x-4) ] = 2/[ (x+6)(x-8) ].

Cross-multiplying:

(x+6)(x-8) = 2*(x+2)(x-4).

Let me expand both sides.

Left side: (x+6)(x-8) = x² -8x +6x -48 = x² -2x -48.

Right side: 2*(x+2)(x-4) = 2*(x² -4x +2x -8) = 2*(x² -2x -8) = 2x² -4x -16.

Set equation:

x² -2x -48 = 2x² -4x -16.

Bring all terms to left side:

x² -2x -48 -2x² +4x +16 = 0.

Combine like terms:

(-x²) +2x -32 =0.

Multiply both sides by -1:

x² -2x +32 =0.

Now, solve quadratic equation x² -2x +32=0.

Discriminant D = (-2)^2 -4*1*32 =4 -128= -124.

Since discriminant is negative, there are no real roots. Therefore, the original equation has no real roots.
