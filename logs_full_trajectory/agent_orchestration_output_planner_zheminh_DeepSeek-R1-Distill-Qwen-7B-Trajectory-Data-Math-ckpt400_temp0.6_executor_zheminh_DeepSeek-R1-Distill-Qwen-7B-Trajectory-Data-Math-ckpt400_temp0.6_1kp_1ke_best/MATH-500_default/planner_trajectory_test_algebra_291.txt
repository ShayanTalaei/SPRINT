<Question>
Alice and Bob are playing a game. Alice starts first. On Alice's turn, she flips a coin. If she gets a heads, she wins. If not, it becomes Bob's turn. On Bob's turn, he flips a coin. If he gets a tails, he wins. If not, it becomes Alice's turn. What is the probability that Alice wins the game?

Okay, let's try to figure out the probability that Alice wins this game. Hmm, so the game starts with Alice flipping a coin. If she gets heads, she wins immediately. If she gets tails, then Bob gets a turn. Bob flips the coin, and if he gets tails, he wins. If he gets heads, then it goes back to Alice, and the game continues like that. So, the turns alternate between Alice and Bob, but only if they don't get a head or tail respectively. Wait, actually, let me make sure I understand the rules correctly.

So, Alice starts. She flips a coin. If heads (H), she wins.
If tails (T), then Bob gets to flip. Bob flips, if he gets tails, he wins. If he gets heads, then it's back to Alice. So, the game continues until someone gets a head. The probability of getting heads or tails on each flip is 0.5 each, assuming a fair coin.

So, the game is a sequence of flips: Alice, then Bob, then Alice, then Bob, etc. , until someone gets a head. The person who gets the first head wins. But with a twist: if Alice gets tails, Bob gets a chance, and if Bob gets tails, Alice gets another chance, and so on.

Wait, actually, no. Let me parse the problem again. "On Alice's turn, she flips a coin. If she gets a heads, she wins. If not, it becomes Bob's turn. On Bob's turn, he flips a coin. If he gets a tails, he wins. If not, it becomes Alice's turn." So, the key here is that when Alice flips tails, Bob gets a turn. On Bob's turn, he flips the coin. If he gets tails, he wins. If he gets heads, then it goes back to Alice. So, the only way the game continues past Bob's turn is if Bob also flips heads. Because if Bob flips tails, he wins. So, the game can last multiple rounds, but each time, the players have to flip heads to keep the game going, otherwise, the other player wins.
So, the structure is: Alice flips. If H, she wins. If T, Bob flips. If Bob gets H, he wins. If Bob gets T, Alice flips again. Etc.

So, the game can be thought of as a series of rounds. Each round consists of Alice flipping, then if she got T, Bob flipping. If Bob got H, he wins; if T, the game repeats. So, the probability that Alice wins on her first flip is 0.5. If she gets T (0.5), then Bob flips. The probability that Bob gets T is 0.5, so the game goes back to Alice. Then the situation is the same as the start.

Wait, so maybe this is a recursive problem? Let me define P as the probability that Alice wins the game. Then, we can write an equation for P.

<prompt_1.1> Define the probability that Alice wins the game and set up a recursive equation for it. </prompt_1.1>

<execution_1.1>
So, on her first turn, Alice has a 0.5 chance to win immediately. If she doesn't win (which is also a 0.5 chance), then Bob gets a turn. Now, Bob flips the coin. If Bob gets heads (0.5 chance), he wins, so Alice loses. If Bob gets tails (0.5 chance), then it's back to Alice's turn, and the probability of Alice winning from here is the same as the original probability P. So, putting this all together, the total probability P can be expressed as the probability that Alice wins on her first flip, plus the probability that the game continues after both Alice and Bob flip tails, multiplied by the probability that Alice wins from that point. 

So, in equation form:
P = (Probability Alice wins on first flip) + (Probability game continues after Alice and Bob flip tails) * P
Which translates to:
P = 0.5 + (0.5 * 0.5) * P
Simplifying the terms inside the parentheses: 0.5 * 0.5 is 0.25. So,
P = 0.5 + 0.25 * P
</execution_1.1>
</Execution_1>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
To solve for P, we can subtract 0.25P from both sides:
P - 0.25P = 0.5
Which gives:
0.75P = 0.5
Then, dividing both sides by 0.75:
P = 0.5 / 0.75
Calculating that, 0.5 divided by 0.75 is the same as 2/3. So, P = 2/3.

Wait, let me check that again. 0.5 divided by 0.75. Since 0.75 is 3/4, dividing 0.5 by 3/4 is multiplying by 4/3, so 0.5 * 4/3 = 2/3.

Alternatively, let's model this as an infinite series. The probability that Alice wins on her first turn is 0.5. The probability that the game returns to Alice after both Alice and Bob flip tails is (0.5 * 0.5) = 0.25. Then, the probability that Alice wins on her second turn would be 0.25 * 0.5. Similarly, the probability that she wins on her third turn is 0.25^2 * 0.5, and so on. So, the total probability is the sum of this infinite geometric series:

<prompt_2.1> Use an infinite geometric series to verify the probability that Alice wins the game. </prompt_2.1>

Alternatively, thinking in terms of expected outcomes. Each round, the probability that the game ends with Alice winning is 0.5 (she flips heads). The probability that the game ends with Bob winning is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 (Alice flips tails, then Bob flips heads). The probability that the game continues is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 (both flip tails). So, the probabilities sum up: Alice wins 0.5, Bob wins 0.25, continue 0.25. Then, the probability that Alice eventually wins is the probability she wins in the first round plus the probability the game continues times her probability of winning from there. Which is again P = 0.5 + 0.25P, leading to P = 2/3.

Another way to think about it is using states. The game starts in State A (Alice's turn). From State A, Alice can win with probability 0.5, transition to State B (Bob's turn) with probability 0.5. From State B, Bob can win with probability 0.5, transition back to State A with probability 0.5. So, the probability of Alice winning can be calculated by considering the transitions between states.

<prompt_2.2> Consider the game as a Markov process with states and verify the probability that Alice wins the game. </prompt_2.2>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
P = 0.5 + 0.25 * 0.5 + 0.25^2 * 0.5 + 0.25^3 * 0.5 + ...
Factoring out 0.5, we get:
P = 0.5 * (1 + 0.25 + 0.25^2 + 0.25^3 + ...)
The sum inside the parentheses is a geometric series with first term 1 and common ratio 0.25. The sum of an infinite geometric series is 1 / (1 - r), so here it's 1 / (1 - 0.25) = 1 / 0.75 = 4/3. Therefore, P = 0.5 * (4/3) = 2/3.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Let me formalize this. Let P be the probability Alice wins starting from State A. Let Q be the probability Alice wins starting from State B. Then, we can write:

From State A:
P = 0.5 + 0.5 * Q

From State B:
Q = 0.5 * 0 + 0.5 * P = 0.5 * P

Because from State B, if Bob flips heads (0.5 chance), Alice loses. If Bob flips tails (0.5 chance), the game goes back to State A, where Alice's probability of winning is P. So substituting Q = 0.5P into the first equation:

P = 0.5 + 0.5 * (0.5P) = 0.5 + 0.25P

Which again gives P = 0.5 / 0.75 = 2/3.

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
So, using multiple approaches—recursive equations, infinite series, and state transitions—we arrive at the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the probability Alice wins the game is 2/3.

Therefore, the probability that Alice wins the game is $\boxed{\frac{2}{3}}$.
