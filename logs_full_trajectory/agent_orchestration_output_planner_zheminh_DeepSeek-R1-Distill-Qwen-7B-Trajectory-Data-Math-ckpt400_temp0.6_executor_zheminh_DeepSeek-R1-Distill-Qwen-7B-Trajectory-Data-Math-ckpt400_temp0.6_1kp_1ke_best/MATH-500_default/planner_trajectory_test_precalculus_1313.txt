Okay, so I need to find the value of x between 0 and 180 degrees such that the equation tan 53° tan 81° tan x° = tan 53° + tan 81° + tan x° holds true. Hmm, trigonometric equation with tangents. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that sometimes when there's a product of tangents equal to the sum, there might be a trigonometric identity that can relate these. Let me recall some tangent addition formulas. The tangent of a sum is (tan A + tan B)/(1 - tan A tan B). But here, we have a product and a sum. Maybe if I can manipulate the equation to fit into an identity?

Alternatively, maybe there's a specific angle x that makes this equation true. Let me consider if 53°, 81°, and x° are related in some way. For instance, maybe they add up to 180°, which is a common scenario in triangle problems. Let me check: 53 + 81 = 134. If x is 46°, then 53 + 81 + 46 = 180.
Wait, 46? Hmm, but why 46? Let me see. If those three angles form a triangle, then maybe there's a relation. But this is just a thought.

Alternatively, perhaps using the identity for tan(A + B + C). But that might be complicated. Let me recall that tan(A + B + C) = (tan A + tan B + tan C - tan A tan B tan C)/(1 - tan A tan B - tan A tan C - tan B tan C). If A + B + C = 180°, then tan(A + B + C) is tan 180° which is 0. So setting the numerator to zero: tan A + tan B + tan C = tan A tan B tan C. Wait a minute! That's exactly the equation given.

So if 53°, 81°, and x° are angles that add up to 180°, then their tangents would satisfy tan 53° + tan 81° + tan x° = tan 53° tan 81° tan x°. Therefore, x must be such that 53 + 81 + x = 180.
Let's compute that: 53 + 81 = 134, so x = 180 - 134 = 46. Therefore, x = 46°.

But let me verify this to be sure.

First, check if 53 + 81 + 46 = 180.

Let me confirm that.

Let's compute tan 53°, tan 81°, and tan 46° approximately to check the equation.

<prompt_1.1> Verify the solution by checking if 53°, 81°, and 46° form a triangle with angles summing to 180°. </prompt_1.1>

Wait, but let me check if there's another possible solution. Suppose x is not part of a triangle, but maybe another angle where the equation still holds. Let's think.

<prompt_1.2> Explore if there could be another solution by considering the tangent function's periodicity and the range of x. </prompt_1.2>

Let me recall approximate values:

tan 53° is approximately 1.333 (since tan 53° is about 1.333), tan 81° is about 6.3138, and tan 46° is approximately 1.0355.

Calculating the left side: tan53 * tan81 * tan46 ≈ 1.333 * 6.3138 * 1.0355. Let me compute that step by step.

First, 1.333 * 6.3138 ≈ 1.333 * 6 = 8, 1.333 * 0.3138 ≈ 0.418, so total ≈ 8.418. Then multiply by 1.0355: 8.418 * 1.0355 ≈ 8.418 + (8.418 * 0.0355) ≈ 8.418 + 0.298 ≈ 8.716.

Now the right side: tan53 + tan81 + tan46 ≈ 1.333 + 6.3138 + 1.0355 ≈ 1.333 + 6.3138 = 7.6468 + 1.0355 ≈ 8.6823. Hmm, that's approximately 8.6823 versus left side 8.716. There's a slight discrepancy here. Maybe my approximations are off? Or maybe the exact value is 46°, but the approximate calculation isn't precise enough.

The equation given is tan A tan B tan C = tan A + tan B + tan C. If A, B, C are angles such that A + B + C = 180°, then this identity holds. However, tangent has a period of 180°, so could there be another angle x' = x + 180°n that satisfies the equation? But the problem states 0 < x < 180, so x must be between 0 and 180. So 46° is the only solution here.

Wait, let's think algebraically.

Suppose we have tan A + tan B + tan C = tan A tan B tan C. If A + B + C = 180°, then this holds because tan(A + B + C) is undefined (since tan 180° is 0, but the formula leads to 0/0). Wait, no, the identity is that if A + B + C = 180°, then tan A + tan B + tan C = tan A tan B tan C. So that's the key. Therefore, if 53°, 81°, and x° are angles summing to 180°, then the equation holds. Therefore, x must be 180 - 53 - 81 = 46. So x = 46.

Therefore, x=46°.
But let me check with exact values.

Alternatively, perhaps use exact trigonometric values.

Let me recall that tan(A + B + C) = (tan A + tan B + tan C - tan A tan B tan C)/ (1 - tan A tan B - tan A tan C - tan B tan C). If A + B + C = 180°, then tan(A + B + C) is tan 180° which is 0. Therefore, the numerator must be zero, leading to tan A + tan B + tan C = tan A tan B tan C. Therefore, the equation given in the problem is a specific case of this identity, provided that the three angles sum to 180°. Therefore, x must be 180 - 53 - 81 = 46. Therefore, x=46°.

<execution_3.2>
Wait, 53° and 81°, those are familiar angles. For example, 53° is close to 45° + 8°, but maybe they are part of a standard triangle. Wait, 53° and 81°, if we consider a triangle with angles 53, 81, 46, does that make sense? Let's check if 53 + 81 + 46 = 180, which it does. So in such a triangle, the tangent identity holds.

Alternatively, maybe using the identity directly. Let's suppose that x = 46°, then 53 + 81 + 46 = 180, so tan 53 + tan 81 + tan 46 = tan 53 tan 81 tan 46. Therefore, the equation is satisfied. So x=46.

But just to be thorough, let me check if there's another possible x in the range 0 < x < 180 that could satisfy the equation. Suppose x is not 46°, but some other angle. Let's see.

Suppose we try x=53°, just to test. Then the equation becomes tan53 tan81 tan53 = tan53 + tan81 + tan53. So left side: (tan53)^2 tan81. Right side: 2 tan53 + tan81. Are these equal? Let's compute approximate values.

tan53 ≈ 1.333, tan81 ≈ 6.3138.

Left side: (1.333)^2 * 6.3138 ≈ 1.777 * 6.3138 ≈ 11.22. Right side: 2*1.333 + 6.3138 ≈ 2.666 + 6.3138 ≈ 8.979. Not equal. So x=53 doesn't work.

How about x=81°? Then equation is tan53 tan81 tan81 = tan53 + tan81 + tan81. Left side: tan53*(tan81)^2 ≈1.333*(6.3138)^2≈1.333*39.86≈53.15. Right side: tan53 + 2 tan81 ≈1.333 + 2*6.3138≈1.333+12.627≈13.96. Not equal. So x=81° not solution.

How about x=45°? Let's check. tan53 tan81 tan45. tan45=1. So left side≈1.333*6.3138*1≈8.41. Right side: 1.333 + 6.3138 +1≈8.646. Close, but not equal. So x=45° not solution. But 46°, as per the sum, gives exact solution.

Alternatively, suppose x is such that 53 +81 +x=180, then x=46. Therefore, this is the solution.
