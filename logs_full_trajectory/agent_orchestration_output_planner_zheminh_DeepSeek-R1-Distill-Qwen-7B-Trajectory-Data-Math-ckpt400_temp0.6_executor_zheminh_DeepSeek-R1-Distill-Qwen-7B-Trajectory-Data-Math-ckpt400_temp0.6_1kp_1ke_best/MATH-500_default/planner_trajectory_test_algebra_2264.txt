<Question>
William Sydney Porter tried to perform the calculation $\frac{-3+4i}{1+2i}$. However, he accidentally missed the minus sign, finding $\frac{3+4i}{1+2i}=\frac{11}{5}-\frac{2}{5}i$. What answer should he have obtained?

Okay, let's see. The problem is about William Sydney Porter who tried to calculate (-3 + 4i)/(1 + 2i) but missed the minus sign, so he did (3 + 4i)/(1 + 2i) instead. He got 11/5 - 2/5 i. Now, we need to find out what the correct answer should be.

First, I remember that when dividing complex numbers, you usually multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator to rationalize it. The conjugate of 1 + 2i is 1 - 2i. So, the standard approach would be to multiply both top and bottom by 1 - 2i.

<prompt_1.1> Re-evaluate the division of the complex numbers (3 + 4i) and (1 + 2i) using the method of multiplying by the conjugate. </prompt_1.1>

But let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Alternatively, let's compute (3 + 4i)/(1 + 2i) step by step.

Now, the original problem was (-3 + 4i)/(1 + 2i). Since he missed the minus sign, he computed (3 + 4i)/(1 + 2i) instead. So, the correct answer should be the original expression's value. Let's compute that.

Wait, but he made a mistake by not changing the sign of the real part. So, instead of -3 +4i, he used 3 +4i. But the question is, what should the correct answer be? So, we need to compute (-3 +4i)/(1 +2i) properly.

First, multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is (1 - 2i):

Numerator: (3 + 4i)(1 - 2i) = 3*1 + 3*(-2i) + 4i*1 + 4i*(-2i) = 3 - 6i + 4i - 8i². Since i² is -1, so -8i² becomes +8. So, combining the real parts: 3 + 8 = 11. The imaginary parts: -6i + 4i = -2i. So numerator is 11 - 2i.

Denominator: (1 + 2i)(1 - 2i) = 1² - (2i)² = 1 - 4i² = 1 - 4(-1) = 1 + 4 = 5.

So, the result is (11 - 2i)/5, which is indeed 11/5 - (2/5)i. So that's correct. So, the problem states that he got that answer, but he actually should have had the negative real part.

Original problem: (-3 + 4i)/(1 + 2i). Let's rationalize this. Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate (1 - 2i):

Numerator: (-3 + 4i)(1 - 2i) = -3*1 + (-3)*(-2i) + 4i*1 + 4i*(-2i) = -3 + 6i + 4i - 8i². Since i² = -1, so -8i² = 8. So combining terms: (-3 + 8) + (6i + 4i) = 5 + 10i.

Denominator: (1 + 2i)(1 - 2i) = 1² - (2i)² = 1 - 4i² = 1 - (-4) = 5. So denominator is 5.

Therefore, the correct answer is (5 + 10i)/5 = 1 + 2i.

Based on execution_1.1:
Let me recall the steps for dividing complex numbers. If we have a complex number a + bi divided by c + di, the division is (a + bi)/(c + di) = [(a + bi)(c - di)] / (c² + d²).
So, applying that here.

<prompt_2.1> Apply the division method for complex numbers to compute (-3 + 4i)/(1 + 2i). </prompt_2.1>

The denominator is (1 + 2i)(1 - 2i) = 1 + 4 = 5, as before. The numerator is (-3 + 4i)(1 - 2i). Let's compute that step by step.

First, expand the numerator:

-3 * 1 = -3

-3 * (-2i) = 6i

4i * 1 = 4i

4i * (-2i) = -8i²

So, combining these terms: -3 + 6i + 4i -8i². Now, combine like terms. The real parts are -3 and -8i². But wait, i² is -1, so -8i² becomes +8. So, the real parts add up to -3 + 8 = 5. The imaginary parts are 6i + 4i = 10i. Therefore, the numerator is 5 + 10i. The denominator is 5, so the result is (5 + 10i)/5 = 1 + 2i.

Based on execution_2.1:
Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me verify again to be sure.

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to check. Since he computed (3 +4i)/(1 +2i) as 11/5 -2/5 i, maybe we can relate that to the correct answer.

<prompt_3.1> Verify the result by relating the incorrect computation to the correct answer using algebraic manipulation. </prompt_3.1>

<execution_3.1>
Let me see.

If the correct answer is (-3 +4i)/(1 +2i) = (5 +10i)/5 = 1 +2i. If he computed (3 +4i)/(1 +2i) = (11 -2i)/5, then perhaps if we take his answer and multiply numerator and denominator by -1, we would get (-11 +2i)/-5 = (11 -2i)/5. But that's not the same as the correct answer. Wait, maybe there's a relation.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer can be expressed in terms of his answer.

Based on execution_3.1:
Let me think. Let me denote the correct answer as C and his answer as H.

<prompt_4.1> Express the correct answer in terms of the incorrect answer obtained from William's calculation. </prompt_4.1>

Let me check with another method. Let's compute (-3 +4i)/(1 +2i) directly.

<prompt_4.2> Verify the result using direct computation and polar form of complex numbers. </prompt_4.2>

So, C = (-3 +4i)/(1 +2i), H = (3 +4i)/(1 +2i) = 11/5 -2/5 i. So, notice that the numerator of C is -(3) +4i, which is -3 +4i, whereas H's numerator is 3 +4i. So, C's numerator is -3 +4i = - (3 -4i). Wait, not sure. Alternatively, maybe there's a relationship between C and H.

Alternatively, note that (-3 +4i) = - (3 -4i). So, C = - (3 -4i)/(1 +2i). If we compute (3 -4i)/(1 +2i), perhaps that's related to H. Let's see.

Alternatively, maybe we can express C in terms of H. Let's see:

C = (-3 +4i)/(1 +2i) = [ - (3 -4i) ] / (1 +2i). If we can relate (3 -4i)/(1 +2i) to H, which is (3 +4i)/(1 +2i). Hmm, not straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps take the conjugate of H?

Wait, H is (3 +4i)/(1 +2i) = 11/5 -2/5 i. If we take the conjugate of H, that would be (3 -4i)/(1 -2i). Let's compute that.

Compute (3 -4i)/(1 -2i). Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 +2i):

Numerator: (3 -4i)(1 +2i) = 3*1 +3*2i -4i*1 -4i*2i = 3 +6i -4i -8i². Real parts: 3 +8 =11. Imaginary parts: 2i. So numerator is 11 +2i. Denominator: (1 -2i)(1 +2i) =1 +4=5. So, (11 +2i)/5 = 11/5 + (2/5)i. Which is the conjugate of H, since H was 11/5 -2/5 i. So, conjugate of H is 11/5 +2/5 i, which is equal to (3 -4i)/(1 -2i). But how does that relate to C?

Wait, C is (-3 +4i)/(1 +2i). Let's see. Let's factor out a -1 from the numerator: - (3 -4i)/(1 +2i). So, C = - (3 -4i)/(1 +2i). If we can compute (3 -4i)/(1 +2i), then multiply by -1 to get C.

Compute (3 -4i)/(1 +2i). Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 -2i):

Numerator: (3 -4i)(1 -2i) = 3*1 -3*2i -4i*1 +4i*2i = 3 -6i -4i +8i². Since i² is -1, 8i² is -8. So real parts: 3 -8 = -5. Imaginary parts: -6i -4i = -10i. So numerator is -5 -10i. Denominator is 5. So, ( -5 -10i ) /5 = -1 -2i. Then, C = - ( -1 -2i ) = 1 +2i. There we go again. So, that's another way to get the same result.

<execution_4.2>
Express both in polar form and divide.

First, (-3 +4i). The magnitude is sqrt((-3)^2 +4^2) = sqrt(9 +16) = sqrt(25) =5. The angle θ is arctan(4/-3). Since the real part is negative and the imaginary part is positive, it's in the second quadrant. So θ = π - arctan(4/3). Similarly, (1 +2i) has magnitude sqrt(1 +4) = sqrt(5), angle φ = arctan(2/1) = arctan(2). 

When dividing complex numbers in polar form, the magnitudes divide and the angles subtract. So, the magnitude of the result is 5 / sqrt(5) = sqrt(5). The angle is [π - arctan(4/3)] - arctan(2). Then, converting back to rectangular form: sqrt(5) * [cos(angle) + i sin(angle)]. 

But maybe this is more complicated. Alternatively, since we already did the algebraic computation and got 1 +2i, which checks out, perhaps this is sufficient.

Alternatively, let's verify by multiplying (1 +2i) by (1 +2i):

(1 +2i)(1 +2i) =1 +4i +4i²=1 +4i -4= -3 +4i. Wait, that's interesting. So (1 +2i)^2 = -3 +4i. Therefore, (-3 +4i)/(1 +2i) = (1 +2i)^2 / (1 +2i) = 1 +2i. So that's another way to see it. That's a neat approach. Since (1 +2i)(1 +2i) = -3 +4i, so dividing -3 +4i by 1 +2i gives back 1 +2i. Therefore, the correct answer is 1 +2i.
