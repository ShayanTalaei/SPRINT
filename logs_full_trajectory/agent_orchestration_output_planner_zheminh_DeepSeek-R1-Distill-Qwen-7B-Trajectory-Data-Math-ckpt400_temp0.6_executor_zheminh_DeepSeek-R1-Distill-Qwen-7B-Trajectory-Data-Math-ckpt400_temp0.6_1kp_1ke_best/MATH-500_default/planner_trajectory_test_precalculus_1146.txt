There exist constants $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ such that
\[(\sin x)^7 = a \sin 7x + b \sin 5x + c \sin 3x + d \sin x\]for all angles $x$.  Find $d$.

Okay, so I need to find the constant d in the equation where (sin x)^7 is expressed as a combination of sin 7x, sin 5x, sin 3x, and sin x. Hmm, I remember that powers of sine can be expanded using trigonometric identities, maybe multiple angle formulas or something like that. Let me think. 

First, I recall that for powers of sine, there's a formula involving multiple angles. Maybe using the complex exponential form? Euler's formula? Because sometimes converting sine into exponentials makes it easier to handle products. Let me try that approach.

So, sin x can be written as (e^(ix) - e^(-ix))/(2i). Therefore, (sin x)^7 would be [(e^(ix) - e^(-ix))/(2i)]^7. Expanding that might be complicated, but perhaps using the binomial theorem? Let's see.

<execution_1.1>
Let me write that out:

[(e^(ix) - e^(-ix))/(2i)]^7 = (1/(2i)^7) * (e^(ix) - e^(-ix))^7.

Expanding (e^(ix) - e^(-ix))^7 using the binomial theorem gives the sum from k=0 to 7 of (7 choose k) * (e^(ix))^k * (-e^(-ix))^(7-k). Simplifying each term: (-1)^(7-k) * e^(i(kx - (7 - k)x)) = (-1)^(7 - k) * e^(i(2k - 7)x). So each term becomes (7 choose k) * (-1)^(7 - k) * e^(i(2k -7)x). Then, multiplying by 1/(2i)^7.

Hmm, this seems doable but might take some time. Let me compute the coefficients step by step.

First, let's compute (2i)^7.

2^7 is 128, and i^7 is i^(4+3) = i^3 = -i. So (2i)^7 = 128 * (-i) = -128i. Therefore, 1/(2i)^7 = 1/(-128i) = i/128. Because 1/i = -i, so 1/(-128i) = -1/(128i) = i/128.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Wait, let's correct that exponent. The term is (e^(ix))^k * (-e^(-ix))^(7 - k) = (-1)^(7 - k) * e^(ikx) * e^(-i(7 - k)x) = (-1)^(7 - k) * e^{i[ kx - (7 - k)x ]} = (-1)^(7 - k) * e^{i(2k -7)x}. Yes, that's right.

So each term is C(7, k) * (-1)^(7 - k) * e^{i(2k -7)x}. Then, multiplying by 1/(2i)^7. So the entire expression is [1/(2i)^7] * Sum_{k=0}^7 C(7, k) (-1)^(7 - k) e^{i(2k -7)x}.

Now, 1/(2i)^7 = (1/2^7) * (1/i^7). Since i^7 = i^(4*1 + 3) = i^3 = -i. Therefore, 1/i^7 = 1/(-i) = i. So 1/(2i)^7 = (1/128) * i. Therefore, the entire expression becomes (i/128) * Sum_{k=0}^7 C(7, k) (-1)^(7 - k) e^{i(2k -7)x}.

Now, let's simplify the sum. Let's factor out the (-1)^(7 - k) term. Let's note that (-1)^(7 - k) = (-1)^7 * (-1)^(-k) = (-1)^7 * (-1)^k = -(-1)^k. Therefore, each term becomes C(7, k) * (-1)^(7 - k) = -C(7, k) (-1)^k. So the sum becomes Sum_{k=0}^7 -C(7, k) (-1)^k e^{i(2k -7)x}. Therefore, the entire expression is (i/128) * (-1) * Sum_{k=0}^7 C(7, k) (-1)^k e^{i(2k -7)x} = (-i/128) Sum_{k=0}^7 C(7, k) (-1)^k e^{i(2k -7)x}.

Now, let's look at the exponents: 2k -7. For k from 0 to7, these exponents will be:

k=0: -7

k=1: -5

k=2: -3

k=3: -1

k=4: 1

k=5: 3

k=6:5

k=7:7

So the exponents go from -7 to 7, stepping by 2? Wait, no, stepping by 2 in exponents? Wait, 2k -7 for k=0 to7 gives exponents: -7, -5, -3, -1, 1,3,5,7. So each odd integer from -7 to7. Therefore, the exponents are symmetric. So the sum can be written as Sum_{m=-7, step 2}^7 coefficients * e^{imx}.

But let's compute each term:

For each k, compute C(7, k)*(-1)^k*(-i/128). Let me compute each coefficient:

Based on execution_2.2:
Starting with k=0:

<prompt_3.1> Compute the coefficients for each term in the sum as per the above plan. </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
Term: C(7,0)*(-1)^0 =1*1=1. So coefficient is (1)*(-i/128) = -i/128. Exponent: -7x. So term: (-i/128) e^{-i7x}

k=1:
C(7,1)=7, (-1)^1=-1. So 7*(-1) = -7. Then multiplied by (-i/128): (-7)*(-i/128) =7i/128. Exponent: -5x. So term: (7i/128) e^{-i5x}

k=2:
C(7,2)=21, (-1)^2=1. 21*1=21. Multiply by (-i/128): 21*(-i/128)= -21i/128. Exponent: -3x. Term: (-21i/128) e^{-i3x}

k=3:
C(7,3)=35, (-1)^3=-1. 35*(-1)= -35. Multiply by (-i/128): (-35)*(-i/128)=35i/128. Exponent: -1x. Term: (35i/128) e^{-ix}

k=4:
C(7,4)=35, (-1)^4=1. 35*1=35. Multiply by (-i/128): 35*(-i/128)= -35i/128. Exponent:1x. Term: (-35i/128) e^{ix}

k=5:
C(7,5)=21, (-1)^5=-1. 21*(-1)= -21. Multiply by (-i/128): (-21)*(-i/128)=21i/128. Exponent:3x. Term: (21i/128) e^{i3x}

k=6:
C(7,6)=7, (-1)^6=1. 7*1=7. Multiply by (-i/128):7*(-i/128)= -7i/128. Exponent:5x. Term: (-7i/128) e^{i5x}

k=7:
C(7,7)=1, (-1)^7=-1. 1*(-1)= -1. Multiply by (-i/128): (-1)*(-i/128)=i/128. Exponent:7x. Term: (i/128) e^{i7x}

So now, combining all these terms, the entire expression is:

(-i/128) e^{-i7x} + (7i/128) e^{-i5x} + (-21i/128) e^{-i3x} + (35i/128) e^{-ix} + (-35i/128) e^{ix} + (21i/128) e^{i3x} + (-7i/128) e^{i5x} + (i/128) e^{i7x}

Now, we can pair the terms with their complex conjugates. For example, the term with e^{-i7x} and e^{i7x} can be paired, similarly for e^{-i5x} and e^{i5x}, etc. Let's do that.

Grouping terms:

1. (-i/128) e^{-i7x} + (i/128) e^{i7x}
2. (7i/128) e^{-i5x} + (-7i/128) e^{i5x}
3. (-21i/128) e^{-i3x} + (21i/128) e^{i3x}

Now, using the identity that e^{iθ} + e^{-iθ} = 2cosθ, but here we have coefficients with i. Let's recall that:

i e^{iθ} - i e^{-iθ} = i (e^{iθ} - e^{-iθ}) = 2 sinθ. Wait, let's check:

e^{iθ} - e^{-iθ} = 2i sinθ. Therefore, multiplying both sides by i: i e^{iθ} - i e^{-iθ} = 2 sinθ. Wait, actually:

Wait, e^{iθ} - e^{-iθ} = 2i sinθ. Therefore, if we have a term like A e^{iθ} + B e^{-iθ}, depending on the coefficients, we can express it in terms of sine or cosine.

Looking at each group:

Group 1: (-i/128) e^{-i7x} + (i/128) e^{i7x} = (i/128)(e^{i7x} - e^{-i7x}) = (i/128)(2i sin7x) = (i * 2i /128) sin7x = ( -2 /128 ) sin7x = (-1/64) sin7x.

Similarly, Group 2: (7i/128) e^{-i5x} + (-7i/128) e^{i5x} = 7i/128 (e^{-i5x} - e^{i5x}) = 7i/128 (-2i sin5x) = 7i * (-2i)/128 sin5x = 7*2*(-i^2)/128 sin5x. Since i*(-i) = -i^2 = 1. So this becomes 14/128 sin5x = 7/64 sin5x.

Group 3: (-21i/128) e^{-i3x} + (21i/128) e^{i3x} = (-21i/128)(e^{-i3x} - e^{i3x}) = (-21i/128)(-2i sin3x) = (-21i)(-2i)/128 sin3x = 42 i^2 /128 sin3x = 42*(-1)/128 sin3x = -21/64 sin3x.

Group 4: (35i/128) e^{-ix} + (-35i/128) e^{ix} = 35i/128 (e^{-ix} - e^{ix}) = 35i/128 (-2i sinx) = 35i*(-2i)/128 sinx = (-70 i^2)/128 sinx = (-70*(-1))/128 sinx = 70/128 sinx = 35/64 sinx.

Therefore, combining all these groups:

(-1/64) sin7x + (7/64) sin5x + (-21/64) sin3x + (35/64) sinx.

Therefore, the original expression (sinx)^7 is equal to:

(-1/64) sin7x + (7/64) sin5x + (-21/64) sin3x + (35/64) sinx.

Comparing this with the given equation:

(sinx)^7 = a sin7x + b sin5x + c sin3x + d sinx.

Therefore, the coefficients correspond as:

a = -1/64,

b = 7/64,

c = -21/64,

d = 35/64.

So the question asks for d, which is 35/64.

But let me cross-verify this result with another method to be sure. Another approach is to use the identity for sin^7x. Maybe using power-reduction formulas or multiple angle identities. Let me recall that powers of sine can be expressed as a sum of multiple angles. The general formula for sin^n x can be found using the binomial theorem with complex exponentials, which is similar to what I did earlier, but perhaps there's a recurrence or a table of coefficients.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for sin^7x. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps using the formula involving the Bernoulli numbers or something else? Hmm, maybe not necessary. Alternatively, using the formula for sin^7x in terms of multiple angles.

<prompt_5.5> Consider using the formula for sin^7x and verify the result as per the above plan. </prompt_5.5>

Wait, but let me check with x=0. If x=0, sinx=0, so (sinx)^7=0. On the right-hand side, d*sinx is also 0, so that doesn't help. Let's try x=π/2.

Group 1: (-i/128)(e^{-i7x} - e^{i7x}) = (-i/128)(-2i sin7x) = (-i * -2i)/128 sin7x = (2i^2)/128 sin7x = 2*(-1)/128 sin7x = -2/128 = -1/64. Correct.

Group 2: 7i/128 (e^{-i5x} - e^{i5x}) = 7i/128 (-2i sin5x) = 7i*(-2i)/128 sin5x = (-14 i^2)/128 sin5x = (-14*(-1))/128 sin5x = 14/128 = 7/64. Correct.

Group 3: (-21i/128)(e^{-i3x} - e^{i3x}) = (-21i/128)(-2i sin3x) = 42 i^2 /128 sin3x = 42*(-1)/128 = -42/128 = -21/64. Correct.

So the coefficients are indeed -1/64, 7/64, -21/64, 35/64. Therefore, d is 35/64.

Alternatively, there's a formula for sin^n x in terms of multiple angles. Let me recall that for sin^2x = (1 - cos2x)/2, sin^3x can be expressed using sin3x and sinx, etc. But for higher powers, it's more complicated. However, perhaps using the identity for sin^7x, we can express it in terms of multiple angles. However, that might be tedious. Alternatively, using the formula for sin^7x as a combination of sin7x, sin5x, sin3x, sinx. 

Alternatively, perhaps using the generating function or orthogonality of the sine functions. Since the functions sin7x, sin5x, etc. , are orthogonal on [0, 2π], we can compute the coefficients by integrating both sides multiplied by sin7x, sin5x, etc. , and using orthogonality. That might be a valid method. Let me try that.

So, if we have (sinx)^7 = a sin7x + b sin5x + c sin3x + d sinx. Then, to find coefficient d, we can multiply both sides by sinx and integrate over [0, 2π]. Then, the right-hand side will have integrals of b sin5x sinx, c sin3x sinx, d sinx sinx, and a sin7x sinx. But due to orthogonality, the integrals of sinnx sinn'x over [0, 2π] is 0 when n ≠ n', and π when n = n' ≠ 0. Therefore, integrating the entire equation against sinx:

∫₀²π (sinx)^7 sinx dx = ∫₀²π [a sin7x + b sin5x + c sin3x + d sinx] sinx dx

The right-hand side becomes:

a ∫₀²π sin7x sinx dx + b ∫₀²π sin5x sinx dx + c ∫₀²π sin3x sinx dx + d ∫₀²π sinx sinx dx

All the first three integrals are zero because of orthogonality (7≠1, 5≠1, 3≠1), and the last integral is d * π. Therefore, the right-hand side is dπ. The left-hand side is ∫₀²π (sinx)^7 sinx dx. Therefore, we can compute d as [∫₀²π (sinx)^8 dx] / π.

Wait, because (sinx)^7 sinx = (sinx)^8. Therefore, d = [1/π] ∫₀²π (sinx)^8 dx.

So, if we can compute the integral of (sinx)^8 over [0, 2π], divide by π, we get d. Let's compute this integral.

The integral of (sinx)^8 dx from 0 to 2π. Using the formula for ∫ (sinx)^{2n} dx from 0 to 2π = 2π * (1*3*5*... *(2n-1))/(2*4*6*... *2n). For n=4, since (sinx)^8 is (sinx)^{2*4}.

Therefore, the integral is 2π * (1*3*5*7)/(2*4*6*8) = 2π * (105)/(384) = 2π * (35)/(128) = 70π/128 = 35π/64. Therefore, the integral of (sinx)^8 from 0 to 2π is 35π/64. Therefore, d = (35π/64)/π = 35/64. So this confirms the earlier result. Therefore, d=35/64.

For example, sin^5x can be expressed as a combination of sin5x, sin3x, and sinx, with coefficients -1/16, 5/16, -5/16, 1/16. Wait, actually, for sin^5x, the formula is (sin5x -5 sin3x +10 sinx)/16. Wait, so coefficients are 1/16 for sin5x, -5/16 for sin3x, and 10/16 for sinx. Wait, but here in our case, for sin^7x, we have coefficients -1/64, 7/64, -21/64, 35/64. So 35/64 for sinx, which is 35/64 ≈0.546, and (sinx)^7 when x=π/4 is (sqrt(2)/2)^7≈0.117. Let's see, sinπ/4=√2/2≈0.707, so (0.707)^7≈0.707^2=0.5, ^3=0.353, ^4=0.25, ^5≈0.176, ^6≈0.125, ^7≈0.084. Wait, but according to the expansion, when x=π/4, sinx=√2/2, so sin7x=sin(7π/4)= -√2/2, sin5x=sin(5π/4)=-√2/2, sin3x=sin(3π/4)=√2/2, sinx=√2/2. Therefore, plugging into the expression:

(-1/64)(-√2/2) + (7/64)(-√2/2) + (-21/64)(√2/2) + (35/64)(√2/2)

= [ (1/64) + (-7/64) + (-21/64) +35/64 ] * (√2/2)

Calculating the coefficients: 1 -7 -21 +35 = 1 -7= -6; -6 -21= -27; -27 +35=8.

So 8/64 * (√2/2) = (1/8)(√2/2)=√2/16≈0.088, which is close to (sinx)^7≈0.084. The slight discrepancy is due to approximation. So this seems correct.

But sin^5x can be expressed as a combination of multiple angles as well. But that might not be more efficient.

Alternatively, using the identity:

sin^7x = (1/2^7) * [7 sinx - 56 sin3x + 14 sin5x - 8 sin7x].

Wait, but that would be similar to the coefficients we obtained. Wait, in our case, we have (sinx)^7 = -1/64 sin7x +7/64 sin5x -21/64 sin3x +35/64 sinx. Which is equivalent to (35 sinx -21 sin3x +7 sin5x - sin7x)/64. So the coefficients are 35, -21,7,-1 for sinx, sin3x, sin5x, sin7x. Which is a pattern where each coefficient is multiplied by 7, then -21, then 35, then -1. Hmm, 35 is 7*5, 21 is 7*3, 7 is 7*1. So 35, -21,7,-1. Interesting. So each coefficient is 7*(-1)^{(k+1)/2} * (4k -1) where k is the order? Not sure, but perhaps there's a combinatorial interpretation here.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for sin^n x. Let me recall that for sin^7x, the expansion can be written using the formula involving the sum over k of C(n, k) (-1)^{(n-k)/2} sin(kx) or something like that. Wait, perhaps using the formula from the exponential expansion is the most straightforward, which we did earlier.

But given that we already did the exponential expansion and cross-checked with plugging in specific values, and the coefficients we obtained check out when tested with x=π/2 and x=π/6, I think the answer is correct.
</execution_5.4>

<execution_5.5>
Alternatively, I remember that for sin^nx, the expansion involves terms with coefficients related to the binomial coefficients but adjusted for the multiple angles. For example, sin^1x = sinx. sin^3x = (3 sinx - sin3x)/4. sin^5x = (10 sinx -5 sin3x + sin5x)/16. Similarly, sin^7x would have coefficients following a certain pattern. Let me see if I can find the coefficients for sin^7x.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula:

sin^n x = \frac{1}{2^n} \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} (-1)^{(n-k)/2} \sin(kx) when n is odd.

Wait, but this might not be exact. Let me think. For example, for sin^3x, the formula would be:

sin^3x = \frac{1}{4} [3 sinx - sin3x], which matches the known identity. Similarly, sin^5x = \frac{1}{16}[10 sinx -5 sin3x + sin5x]. So the coefficients are 10, -5, 1 for sinx, sin3x, sin5x. So for sin^7x, maybe the coefficients follow 35, -21, 7, -1 for sinx, sin3x, sin5x, sin7x? But in our previous calculation, we have coefficients 35/64 for sinx, -21/64 for sin3x, 7/64 for sin5x, -1/64 for sin7x. Wait, but in the standard formula, the coefficients for sin^7x would be 35, -21, 7, -1 for the respective sine terms.

Wait, let me check.

Looking up the formula for sin^7x, I recall that it can be expressed as:

sin^7x = (35 sinx - 21 sin3x + 7 sin5x - sin7x)/64.

Yes, that's exactly what we derived here. So the coefficient d, which is the coefficient of sinx, is 35/64. Therefore, the answer is 35/64. So that seems correct.

But just to be thorough, let me check another source or derive it using a different method.

Alternatively, using the formula for sin^7x, we can express it using the identity:

sin^7x = \frac{35 sinx - 21 sin3x + 7 sin5x - sin7x}{64}.

Yes, this is a known expansion. For example, in standard trigonometric identities, the expansion of sin^7x is given by that formula. Therefore, the coefficient d is indeed 35/64.

Then sinx=1, so left side is 1. On the right side: a sin7x + ... + d sinx. Since x=π/2, sin7x=sin(7π/2)=sin(3π + π/2)= -1. Similarly, sin5x=sin(5π/2)=1, sin3x=sin(3π/2)=-1, sinx=1. Therefore, right side is a*(-1) + b*(1) + c*(-1) + d*(1). Plugging in the coefficients:

a=-1/64, so -(-1/64)=1/64

b=7/64, so 7/64

c=-21/64, so -(-21/64)=21/64

d=35/64, so 35/64

Total: 1/64 +7/64 +21/64 +35/64 = (1+7+21+35)/64 =64/64=1. Which matches the left side. So that works. Let me check another angle.

How about x=π/4. Then sinx=√2/2. Then (sinx)^7=(√2/2)^7= (2^(1/2)/2)^7=2^(7/2)/2^7=2^(7/2 -7)=2^(-7/2 +7/2 -7/2)=Wait, maybe compute directly:

(√2/2)^7 = (2^(1/2)/2)^7 = (2^(1/2))^7 / 2^7 = 2^(7/2) / 128 = (2^3 * 2^(1/2)) /128 = 8*sqrt(2)/128 = sqrt(2)/16 ≈0.08838834765.

Now compute the right side:

a sin7x + b sin5x + c sin3x + d sinx.

x=π/4, so 7x=7π/4, 5x=5π/4, 3x=3π/4, x=π/4.

sin7x=sin7π/4= -√2/2

sin5x=sin5π/4= -√2/2

sin3x=sin3π/4= √2/2

sinx=√2/2

Therefore, right side:

a*(-√2/2) + b*(-√2/2) + c*(√2/2) + d*(√2/2)

Plugging in the coefficients:

a=-1/64: (-1/64)*(-√2/2)= (1/64)(√2/2)=√2/128

b=7/64: (7/64)*(-√2/2)= -7√2/128

c=-21/64: (-21/64)*(√2/2)= -21√2/128

d=35/64: (35/64)*(√2/2)=35√2/128

Adding them up:

√2/128 -7√2/128 -21√2/128 +35√2/128

Combine coefficients:

(1 -7 -21 +35)√2/128 = (1 -7= -6; -6 -21= -27; -27 +35=8) 8√2/128 = √2/16, which matches the left side. So that works. Therefore, the coefficients are correct.

Therefore, d=35/64.

On the right-hand side:

-1/64 sin(7π/6) +7/64 sin(5π/6) -21/64 sin(π/2) +35/64 sin(π/6)

Compute each term:

sin(7π/6)= -1/2, so -1/64*(-1/2)=1/128≈0.0078125

sin(5π/6)=1/2, so 7/64*(1/2)=7/128≈0.0546875

sin(π/2)=1, so -21/64*1≈-0.328125

sin(π/6)=1/2, so 35/64*(1/2)=35/128≈0.2734375

Adding all terms: 1/128 +7/128 -21/128 +35/128 = (1 +7 -21 +35)/128 = (22)/128 = 11/64≈0.171875. Wait, but (sinx)^7 was 1/128≈0.0078125. These don't match. Wait, that's a problem. There's a discrepancy here. So my earlier calculation must be wrong.

Wait, that's a critical issue. Let me check where I went wrong.
