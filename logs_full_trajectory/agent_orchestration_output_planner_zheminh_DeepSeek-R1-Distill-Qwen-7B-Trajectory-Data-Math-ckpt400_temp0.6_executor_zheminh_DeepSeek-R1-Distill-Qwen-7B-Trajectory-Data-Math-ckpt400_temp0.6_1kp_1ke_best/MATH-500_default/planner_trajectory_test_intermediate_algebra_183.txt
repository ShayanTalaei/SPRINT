Let $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ be positive real numbers.  Find the set of all possible values of
\[\frac{c}{a} + \frac{a}{b + c} + \frac{b}{c}.\]
</Question>

<think>
<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to find all possible values of the expression \(\frac{c}{a} + \frac{a}{b + c} + \frac{b}{c}\) where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are positive real numbers. Hmm, let's see. I remember that for inequalities involving variables in fractions like this, techniques like the AM-GM inequality or Cauchy-Schwarz might be useful. But first, maybe I should try to see if there's a minimum or maximum value for this expression. Let me start by analyzing each term.

None

<prompt_1.1> Analyze each term of the expression \(\frac{c}{a} + \frac{a}{b + c} + \frac{b}{c}\) to understand their behavior. </prompt_1.1>
-----

But is this the only possible value? Or can the expression take any value greater than or equal to 2?

Wait, maybe I need to check if the expression can actually take any value above 2 or if it's fixed at 2. Let me test with some specific values.

<prompt_1.2> Test specific values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) to see if the expression can take values greater than 2. </prompt_1.2>
-----

But let's check another case. Suppose c is very large compared to a and b. Let me set a = 1, c = t (large), and b = 1. Then the expression becomes:

<prompt_1.3> Analyze the expression when one variable is very large compared to others. </prompt_1.3>

What if c is very small? Let a =1, c = ε (small), b=1. Then:

<prompt_1.4> Analyze the expression when one variable is very small compared to others. </prompt_1.4>
-----

But wait, let me test another example. Let me set a=2, b=2, c=1.

<prompt_1.5> Test specific values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) to see if the expression can take values greater than 2. </prompt_1.5>
-----

But let's check another case where variables are different. Let me take a=1, b=2, c=1.

<prompt_1.6> Analyze the expression with different values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) to see if the expression can take values greater than 2. </prompt_1.6>
-----

But wait, let's try another example where the variables are not equal. Let's say a=1, b=1, c=2.

<prompt_1.7> Test specific values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) to see if the expression can take values greater than 2. </prompt_1.7>
-----

But let's test another example. Let me take a=1, b=1, c=1.

<prompt_1.8> Test specific values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) to see if the expression can take values greater than 2. </prompt_1.8>
-----

But let's try another approach. Maybe use substitution. Let me set variables in terms of ratios. Let me let x = c/a, y = b/c, so that the expression becomes x + 1/(x y + 1) + y. Wait, let me check:

<prompt_1.9> Use substitution to analyze the expression and confirm the set of possible values. </prompt_1.9>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
First, each term is a fraction where the numerator and denominator are positive. Let's look at each term individually:

1. \(\frac{c}{a}\): This term can take any positive value depending on the ratio of \(c\) to \(a\). If \(c\) is much larger than \(a\), this term can be large. Conversely, if \(c\) is much smaller, this term can be small.

2. \(\frac{a}{b + c}\): This term depends on both \(b\) and \(c\). If \(b + c\) is small (i.e., \(b\) and \(c\) are small), then this term can be large. If \(b + c\) is large, this term becomes small.

3. \(\frac{b}{c}\): Similar to the first term, this ratio can be large or small depending on the relationship between \(b\) and \(c\).
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
Suppose a = b = c = 1. Then the expression is \(\frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{1 + 1} + \frac{1}{1} = 1 + 0.5 + 1 = 2.5\). Hmm, that's 2.5. But maybe if I choose different values, I can get lower?

Let me try a = 1, b = 1, c approaching 0. Then the expression becomes \(\frac{0}{1} + \frac{1}{1 + 0} + \frac{1}{0}\). Wait, but c is approaching 0, so \(\frac{c}{a}\) approaches 0, \(\frac{a}{b + c}\) approaches 1, and \(\frac{b}{c}\) approaches infinity. So in this case, the expression goes to infinity. Okay, so it can be made arbitrarily large.

What if I let c approach infinity? Let a = 1, b = 1, c approaching infinity. Then \(\frac{c}{1}\) approaches infinity, \(\frac{1}{1 + c}\) approaches 0, and \(\frac{1}{c}\) approaches 0. So again, the expression approaches infinity. So it seems like the expression can be made arbitrarily large, so there's no upper bound. But maybe there's a lower bound?
</execution_1.2>

<execution_1.3>
\[
\frac{t}{1} + \frac{1}{1 + t} + \frac{1}{t} = t + \frac{1}{1 + t} + \frac{1}{t}
\]
As t approaches infinity, this expression behaves like t + 0 + 0, which goes to infinity. So in this case, the expression can be made arbitrarily large. So there's no upper bound?

Wait, but when I set a=1, b=1, c=t, the expression is t + 1/(1 + t) + 1/t. As t increases, the first term t dominates, so yes, it goes to infinity. So the expression can be made as large as we want.
</execution_1.3>

<execution_1.4>
\[
\frac{c}{a} = \frac{\epsilon}{1} = \epsilon
\]
\[
\frac{a}{b + c} = \frac{1}{1 + \epsilon} \approx 1 - \epsilon
\]
\[
\frac{b}{c} = \frac{1}{\epsilon} \approx \frac{1}{\epsilon}
\]
So the expression is approximately \(\epsilon + (1 - \epsilon) + \frac{1}{\epsilon} = 1 + \frac{1}{\epsilon}\), which goes to infinity as \(\epsilon\) approaches 0. Hmm, so if we make c very small, the expression becomes very large. Similarly, if we make c very large, let's see:
\[
\frac{c}{a} = c
\]
\[
\frac{a}{b + c} = \frac{1}{1 + c} \approx 0
\]
\[
\frac{b}{c} = \frac{1}{c} \approx 0
\]
So the expression is approximately \(c\), which goes to infinity as c increases. Therefore, the expression can become arbitrarily large.
</execution_1.4>

<execution_1.5>
\(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{2}{1 + 1} + \frac{1}{2}\) = 0.5 + 1 + 0.5 = 2. Again, 2.
</execution_1.5>

<execution_1.6>
\(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{2}{2 + 1} + \frac{2}{1} = 0.5 + 0.666... + 2 = 3.166...\), which is more than 2.
</execution_1.6>

<execution_1.7>
Then the expression becomes:

\(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{2}{2 + 1} + \frac{2}{1} = 0.5 + 2/3 + 2 ≈ 0.5 + 0.666... + 2 ≈ 3.166....\), which is still greater than 2.
</execution_1.7>

<execution_1.8>
Then the expression is 1 + 1/2 + 1 = 1 + 0.5 + 1 = 2.5, which is greater than 2. So that's consistent with the lower bound being 2.

But if I take a=1, b=1, c=1, the expression is 1 + 1/2 + 1 = 2.5. So that's also greater than 2.
</execution_1.8>

<execution_1.9>
Since a, b, c >0, x and y are positive real numbers. Then:

Original expression:

\[
\frac{c}{a} = x
\]
\[
\frac{a}{b + c} = \frac{a}{c(y + 1)} = \frac{1}{x(y + 1)}
\]
\[
\frac{b}{c} = y
\]

So the expression is x + y + \frac{1}{x(y + 1)}. Hmm, this substitution might not have simplified much. Let's see. Maybe set z = y +1, then z >1. Then expression becomes x + (z -1) + \frac{1}{x z} = x + z -1 + \frac{1}{x z}. Not sure if this helps.
</execution_1.9>
</Execution_1>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Maybe applying AM-GM inequality here. The AM-GM inequality states that for non-negative numbers, the arithmetic mean is at least the geometric mean. Let's see if we can apply it here.

<prompt_2.1> Apply the AM-GM inequality to the expression \(\frac{c}{a} + \frac{a}{b + c} + \frac{b}{c}\) and attempt to find a lower bound. </prompt_2.1>
-----

Based on execution_1.2:
But earlier, when I set a = b = c, I got 2.5, which is higher than 2. So maybe 2 is the minimum value?

But how can the expression be equal to 2? Let me see if that's possible.

<prompt_2.2> Explore if the expression can attain the value 2 by setting variables equal. </prompt_2.2>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Looking at the three terms: \(\frac{c}{a}\), \(\frac{a}{b + c}\), and \(\frac{b}{c}\). If I can relate these terms in a way that their product is a constant or can be bounded, maybe I can apply AM-GM.

Let's compute the product of the three terms:

\[
\frac{c}{a} \cdot \frac{a}{b + c} \cdot \frac{b}{c} = \frac{c \cdot a \cdot b}{a \cdot (b + c) \cdot c} = \frac{b}{b + c}
\]

Hmm, that's \(\frac{b}{b + c}\), which is less than 1. So the product of the three terms is less than 1. But AM-GM says that the arithmetic mean is at least the geometric mean. However, since the product is less than 1, the geometric mean would be less than 1, but the arithmetic mean could still be greater or less than 1. So maybe this approach isn't directly helpful.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Suppose I set a = b = c. Let’s try that. Let a = b = c = k (any positive real number). Then:

\[
\frac{c}{a} = 1, \quad \frac{a}{b + c} = \frac{k}{k + k} = \frac{1}{2}, \quad \frac{b}{c} = 1
\]
So the expression becomes 1 + 1/2 + 1 = 2.5. Hmm, that's 2.5, not 2. So maybe 2 is not attainable? But how?

Wait, maybe if I set different variables. Let me try setting c = a, and see if that helps. Let’s let c = a, so the first term becomes 1. Then the expression is:

1 + \(\frac{a}{b + a}\) + \(\frac{b}{a}\). Let me set a =1 for simplicity. Then:

1 + \(\frac{1}{b + 1}\) + b. Let’s denote this as f(b) = 1 + \(\frac{1}{b + 1}\) + b. Let's find the minimum of this function.

Take derivative with respect to b:

f'(b) = -1/(b +1)^2 + 1. Set to zero:

-1/(b +1)^2 + 1 = 0 => 1 = 1/(b +1)^2 => (b +1)^2 =1 => b +1 =1 (since b >0) => b=0. But b must be positive. So the minimum occurs as b approaches 0. Then f(b) approaches 1 + 1/1 + 0 = 2. So again, approaching 2 but not reaching it. Hmm. But when b approaches 0, c =a=1, so c/a=1, a/(b +c)=1/(1 +0)=1, and b/c=0/1=0. So the expression approaches 1 +1 +0=2. So maybe 2 is the infimum?
</execution_2.2>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.2:
But variables must be positive, so b can't be zero. Therefore, the expression can get as close to 2 as desired but never actually reach 2. But wait, in the problem statement, it says "positive real numbers", so a, b, c >0. So if we can make the expression approach 2, but never actually attain it, then the set of possible values is [2, ∞). But is that correct?

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to attain 2. Let me check another case.

<prompt_3.1> Re-evaluate if the expression can attain the value 2 by considering different variable settings. </prompt_3.1>
-----

Based on execution_2.1, execution_1.2, execution_1.3, execution_1.4, execution_1.5, execution_1.6, execution_1.7, execution_1.8:
So, putting this together, it seems that the expression can take any value from 2 to infinity. But I need to confirm this more rigorously. Let me try to formalize this.

First, let's establish the lower bound.

<prompt_3.2> Formalize the set of possible values by establishing a lower bound and showing the expression can take any value above this bound. </prompt_3.2>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
Suppose I set b very small. Let’s say a = c =1, and b approaches 0. Then:

\(\frac{c}{a} =1\), \(\frac{a}{b + c} = \frac{1}{b +1}\), which approaches 1 as b approaches 0, and \(\frac{b}{c} = b\), which approaches 0. So the expression approaches 1 +1 +0=2. So again, approaching 2. So maybe 2 is the greatest lower bound (infimum), but not attainable. However, the problem asks for the set of all possible values. If the expression can get arbitrarily close to 2, then 2 is included in the set if the expression can attain it, but since it can't, maybe 2 is not included. Wait, but in real numbers, the set would be [2, ∞) because even though 2 isn't attained, we can get as close as we want. But in terms of attainable values, maybe the expression can take any value greater than 2. Wait, but when I set a = b = c, I got 2.5, and when I set variables differently, I can get higher values. So maybe the expression can take any value from 2 upwards, meaning the set is [2, ∞).
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
Using the AM-GM inequality on two of the terms. Let's consider the terms \(\frac{c}{a}\) and \(\frac{a}{b + c}\). Applying AM-GM on these two:

\[
\frac{\frac{c}{a} + \frac{a}{b + c}}{2} \geq \sqrt{\frac{c}{a} \cdot \frac{a}{b + c}} = \sqrt{\frac{c}{b + c}}
\]

But \(\sqrt{\frac{c}{b + c}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{b}{b + c}} < 1\). So this doesn't directly give a useful lower bound. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, let's use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. For the terms \(\frac{c}{a}\) and \(\frac{a}{b + c}\), perhaps consider:

\[
\frac{c}{a} + \frac{a}{b + c} \geq 2 \sqrt{\frac{c}{a} \cdot \frac{a}{b + c}} = 2 \sqrt{\frac{c}{b + c}}
\]

But again, this is less than 2, since \(\sqrt{\frac{c}{b + c}} < 1\). So this approach might not help.

Wait, maybe consider the entire expression. Let me denote \(x = \frac{c}{a}\) and \(y = \frac{b}{c}\). Then, the expression becomes:

\[
x + \frac{1}{a(b + c)} \cdot a + y = x + \frac{1}{(b + c)/a} + y
\]

Wait, perhaps this substitution isn't helpful. Let me try again.

Let’s set \(x = \frac{c}{a}\) and \(y = \frac{b}{c}\). Then, \(b = cy\), and \(a = \frac{c}{x}\). Let's express everything in terms of x and y. Then:

The expression becomes:

\[
x + \frac{\frac{c}{x}}{cy + c} + y = x + \frac{1}{x(y + 1)} + y
\]

So the expression is \(x + y + \frac{1}{x(y + 1)}\), where \(x > 0\) and \(y > 0\).

Now, we need to find the set of all possible values of \(x + y + \frac{1}{x(y + 1)}\) for \(x > 0\), \(y > 0\).

Hmm, this seems more manageable. Let's denote \(z = y + 1\), so \(z > 1\). Then, the expression becomes:

\[
x + (z - 1) + \frac{1}{x z} = x + z - 1 + \frac{1}{x z}
\]

So, we need to find the minimum of \(x + z + \frac{1}{x z} - 1\) where \(x > 0\), \(z > 1\).
</execution_3.2>
</Execution_3>

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.2:
Let's denote this as \(f(x, z) = x + z + \frac{1}{x z} - 1\). To find the minimum, we can take partial derivatives with respect to x and z and set them to zero.

<prompt_4.1> Find the minimum of the expression \(x + z + \frac{1}{x z}\) using calculus. </prompt_4.1>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
First, partial derivative with respect to x:

\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 1 - \frac{1}{x^2 z}
\]

Set to zero:

\[
1 - \frac{1}{x^2 z} = 0 \implies x^2 z = 1 \implies z = \frac{1}{x^2}
\]

Now, partial derivative with respect to z:

\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial z} = 1 - \frac{1}{x z^2}
\]

Set to zero:

\[
1 - \frac{1}{x z^2} = 0 \implies x z^2 = 1 \implies x = \frac{1}{z^2}
\]

But from the previous equation, we have \(z = \frac{1}{x^2}\). Substitute \(x = \frac{1}{z^2}\) into this:

\[
z = \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{z^2}\right)^2} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{z^4}} = z^4
\]
</execution_4.1>
</Execution_4>

<Plan_5>
Based on execution_4.1:
This gives \(z^4 - z = 0 \implies z(z^3 - 1) = 0\). Since \(z > 1\), \(z = 1\) is the only real root, but \(z > 1\), so there's no critical point in the domain \(z > 1\). Therefore, the minimum occurs on the boundary.

<prompt_5.1> Analyze the boundary conditions for the function \(f(x, z)\) to find the minimum value. </prompt_5.1>
</Plan_5>

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
Since \(z > 1\), the boundary is as \(z\) approaches 1 from above or as \(z\) approaches infinity. Let's check both cases.

Case 1: \(z \to 1^+\).

Then, from \(z = \frac{1}{x^2}\), as \(z \to 1^+\), \(x \to 1\). So substituting into \(f(x, z)\):

\[
f(x, z) = x + z + \frac{1}{x z} - 1 \approx 1 + 1 + \frac{1}{1 \cdot 1} -1 = 1 + 1 + 1 -1 = 2
\]

Case 2: \(z \to \infty\).

Then, \(x = \frac{1}{z^2} \to 0\). So:

\[
f(x, z) = x + z + \frac{1}{x z} -1 \approx 0 + z + \frac{1}{0 \cdot z} -1
\]
</execution_5.1>
</Execution_5>

<Plan_6>
Based on execution_5.1:
Wait, \(\frac{1}{x z}\) becomes \(\frac{1}{(1/z^2) z} = z\), so:

\[
f(x, z) \approx 0 + z + z -1 = 2z -1 \to \infty \text{ as } z \to \infty
\]

Therefore, the function \(f(x, z)\) attains its minimum value of 2 as \(z \to 1^+\) and \(x \to 1\). However, since \(z > 1\) and \(x > 0\), the variables can't actually reach the boundary, so the expression can get arbitrarily close to 2 but never actually reaches it. Therefore, the infimum is 2, but it's not attainable. However, in terms of the set of possible values, since we can make the expression as close to 2 as desired, and can make it arbitrarily large, the set of all possible values is \([2, \infty)\).

But wait, the problem states that \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are positive real numbers. So, variables can't be zero, but they can approach zero. Therefore, the expression can approach 2 but can't actually be 2. However, in mathematics, when we talk about the set of possible values, even if the expression never actually attains 2, if it can get arbitrarily close, 2 is included in the set as a limit point.

<prompt_6.1> Confirm the set of possible values considering the above plan. </prompt_6.1>
</Plan_6>

<Execution_6>
<execution_6.1>
But the problem says "Find the set of all possible values", so depending on whether the expression can actually attain every value above 2 or not. Wait, but maybe through other substitutions, we can show that for any value greater than 2, we can find \(a\), \(b\), \(c\) such that the expression equals that value.

Alternatively, since we can make the expression approach 2 and also go to infinity, the set of possible values is all real numbers from 2 to infinity. But since 2 is the infimum and not attainable, but in the context of positive real numbers, maybe 2 is included as a limit. However, in the context of possible values, if the expression can get as close to 2 as desired, then 2 is included in the set as a limit point. But depending on the problem's requirement, sometimes they consider the set as the interval starting from the minimum attainable value. But since the minimum isn't attained, but the expression can get arbitrarily close, the set would be \([2, \infty)\). However, I need to confirm if 2 is actually attainable.

Wait, let's suppose we set \(a = c\), \(b\) approaching 0. Then, as \(b \to 0\), the expression \(\frac{c}{a} = 1\), \(\frac{a}{b + c} \to \frac{a}{c} = 1\), and \(\frac{b}{c} \to 0\). So the expression approaches 1 + 1 + 0 = 2. Therefore, even though \(b\) can't be zero, by taking \(b\) as small as we like, the expression can get as close to 2 as we want. Therefore, 2 is the infimum, but not attainable. However, in the context of possible values, since the variables are positive, the expression can take any value greater than 2. Wait, but when I set \(a = b = c\), the expression was 2.5, which is above 2. So, does that mean that the expression can take any value from just above 2 to infinity? But how do we know there are no gaps in between?

To confirm that the expression can take any value in \((2, \infty)\), let's consider the following. Suppose we fix \(a = c = 1\), and vary \(b\). Then the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{b + 1} + \frac{b}{1} = 1 + \frac{1}{b + 1} + b
\]

Let’s denote this function as \(f(b) = 1 + \frac{1}{b + 1} + b\), where \(b > 0\). Let's analyze this function.

Compute the derivative:

\(f'(b) = -\frac{1}{(b + 1)^2} + 1\)

Set to zero:

\[
-\frac{1}{(b + 1)^2} + 1 = 0 \implies (b + 1)^2 = 1 \implies b + 1 = 1 \implies b = 0
\]

But \(b > 0\), so there's no critical point in the domain. Evaluate the limit as \(b \to 0^+\):

\[
\lim_{b \to 0^+} f(b) = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2
\]

As \(b \to \infty\):

\[
\lim_{b \to \infty} f(b) = 1 + 0 + \infty = \infty
\]

Therefore, the function \(f(b)\) is decreasing from just above 2 to a minimum (but no minimum since it approaches 2) and then increases to infinity. Wait, but since the derivative is always positive?

Wait, let's check the derivative again. For \(b > 0\):

\(f'(b) = 1 - \frac{1}{(b + 1)^2}\)

When is this derivative positive or negative?

Set \(f'(b) = 0\):

\[
1 - \frac{1}{(b + 1)^2} = 0 \implies (b + 1)^2 = 1 \implies b = 0
\]

For \(b > 0\), let's check the sign of \(f'(b)\):

If \(b > 0\), then \(b + 1 > 1\), so \((b + 1)^2 > 1\), so \(\frac{1}{(b + 1)^2} < 1\), hence \(f'(b) = 1 - \text{something less than 1} > 0\). Therefore, \(f(b)\) is strictly increasing for \(b > 0\). Wait, but as \(b\) increases from 0 to infinity, \(f(b)\) increases from 2 to infinity. But when \(b\) approaches 0, \(f(b)\) approaches 2, and as \(b\) increases, \(f(b)\) increases without bound. Therefore, for \(a = c = 1\), varying \(b\) from near 0 to infinity, the expression takes all values in \((2, \infty)\). Therefore, by varying \(b\), we can attain any value greater than 2. Similarly, by adjusting other variables, we can cover the entire interval \((2, \infty)\). Since we can approach 2 as closely as desired, 2 is the infimum, but not attainable. Therefore, the set of all possible values is \([2, \infty)\).

However, to confirm, let's check another case. Suppose we set \(a = 1\), \(c = t\), and \(b = kt\), where \(t\) and \(k\) are positive real numbers. Then the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{t}{1} + \frac{1}{kt + t} + \frac{kt}{t} = t + \frac{1}{t(k + 1)} + k
\]

Let’s fix \(k = 1\), then the expression is \(t + \frac{1}{2t} + 1\). Let’s analyze this as a function of \(t > 0\).

Compute the derivative:

\(f(t) = t + \frac{1}{2t} + 1\)

\(f'(t) = 1 - \frac{1}{2t^2}\)

Set to zero:

\(1 - \frac{1}{2t^2} = 0 \implies t^2 = \frac{1}{2} \implies t = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\)

Then the minimum value is:

\(f\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{1}{2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}} + 1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + 1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + 1 = \sqrt{2} + 1 \approx 2.414\)

So in this case, the minimum is approximately 2.414, which is greater than 2. Therefore, by choosing different relations between variables, we can have different minimum values. But when we set \(a = c\) and let \(b\) approach zero, we can get the expression as close to 2 as desired. Therefore, even though in some configurations the minimum is higher, by adjusting the variables appropriately, we can approach 2. Therefore, the set of all possible values is all real numbers greater than or equal to 2. But since 2 is not attainable, but can be approached, in the context of the problem, which asks for the set of all possible values, it's the interval [2, ∞).

But let me verify with another example. Suppose I want the expression to equal 3. Can I find \(a\), \(b\), \(c\) such that it equals 3? Yes. For example, take \(a = b = c = 1\), then the expression is 2.5. To get 3, maybe adjust variables.



Therefore, combining all these observations, the expression can take any value from just above 2 to infinity. Since 2 is the infimum and the expression can be made arbitrarily close to 2, and can be made arbitrarily large, the set of all possible values is the interval [2, ∞). However, since 2 is not attained, but the problem may consider the closure. But in mathematics, the set of possible values would be [2, ∞) because 2 is the greatest lower bound, even if not attained. But depending on the problem's context, sometimes they require open intervals if the bound isn't attained. However, in analysis, the set is considered as [2, ∞) because the infimum is 2, and the expression can get as close as desired to 2. Therefore, the answer should be that the set of all possible values is [2, ∞).
