Okay, so the question is asking how many of the first one hundred positive integers are divisible by 3, 4, and 5. Hmm, let me think. 

First, I need to understand what it means for a number to be divisible by 3, 4, and 5. If a number is divisible by all three of these, then it must be a common multiple of 3, 4, and 5. The smallest such number would be the least common multiple (LCM) of these three numbers. Once I find the LCM, I can then determine how many multiples of that LCM are there within the first 100 positive integers.

Let me start by calculating the LCM of 3, 4, and 5. To find the LCM, I can break each number down into its prime factors:

<prompt_1.1> Calculate the LCM of 3, 4, and 5 using prime factorization as described in the above plan. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
- 3 is a prime number, so its prime factorization is 3.
- 4 can be factored into 2 x 2, which is 2².
- 5 is a prime number, so its prime factorization is 5.

The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime numbers that appear in the factorizations. So, the primes here are 2, 3, and 5. The highest power of 2 is 2² from 4, the highest power of 3 is 3¹ from 3, and the highest power of 5 is 5¹ from 5. Therefore, the LCM should be 2² x 3¹ x 5¹.

Calculating that: 2² is 4, 4 x 3 is 12, and 12 x 5 is 60. So, the LCM of 3, 4, and 5 is 60.

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
That means 60 is the smallest number divisible by 3, 4, and 5. Now, the next step is to find how many multiples of 60 are there in the first 100 numbers.

<prompt_2.1> Determine how many multiples of 60 are within the first 100 positive integers as described in the above plan. </prompt_2.1>

But let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's list the multiples of 60: 60, 120, 180, etc.

<prompt_2.2> Verify the solution by listing the multiples of 60 and checking against the first 100 positive integers as described in the above plan. </prompt_2.2>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Let's list the multiples of 60:

- 1st multiple: 60 x 1 = 60
- 2nd multiple: 60 x 2 = 120
- 3rd multiple: 60 x 3 = 180
- And so on.

But wait, we're only considering the first 100 positive integers, which are 1 to 100. The first multiple of 60 is 60 itself, which is within 1-100. The next multiple is 120, which is 60 x 2. But 120 is greater than 100, so it's outside the range. Therefore, only 60 is a multiple of 60 within the first 100 numbers.

So that would mean there's only one number (60) that's divisible by 3, 4, and 5 in the first 100 positive integers.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
So, the first multiple is 60, the second is 120, which is already over 100. Therefore, only 60 is within the first 100 numbers. 

Wait a second, maybe I should confirm if 60 is indeed divisible by 3, 4, and 5. Let's check:

60 ÷ 3 = 20, which is an integer.

60 ÷ 4 = 15, which is also an integer.

60 ÷ 5 = 12, which is an integer as well. So yes, 60 is divisible by all three. And the next one is 120, which is outside the range. Therefore, only one number.
</execution_2.2>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
But hold on, let me verify if 60 is indeed divisible by all three numbers. 

Dividing 60 by 3: 60 ÷ 3 = 20.
Dividing 60 by 4: 60 ÷ 4 = 15.
Dividing 60 by 5: 60 ÷ 5 = 12.

None of these divisions result in a remainder, so yes, 60 is divisible by 3, 4, and 5.

But just to be thorough, is there another number less than or equal to 100 that is divisible by all three? Let's think. The LCM is 60, so the next one would be 60 x 2 = 120, which is over 100. Therefore, no other numbers in that range.

Another way to approach this problem is to find numbers divisible by 3, 4, and 5. So, a number divisible by 3, 4, and 5 must be divisible by their LCM, which we found to be 60.
Therefore, the count of such numbers is the floor division of 100 by 60, which is 1.

Alternatively, if I didn't use LCM, maybe approach it by finding numbers divisible by all three. So, numbers divisible by 3 and 4 must be divisible by their LCM. Let's compute LCM of 3 and 4 first.

<prompt_3.1> Explore an alternative method to solve the problem without using LCM, as described in the above plan. </prompt_3.1>

Alternatively, maybe another approach: If a number is divisible by 4, it's already divisible by 2 and 2. Then, to be divisible by 3 and 5, it needs to have 3 and 5 as factors. So, the number must have 2², 3, and 5 as prime factors.
Therefore, the smallest such number is 2² * 3 * 5 = 60, as before. Hence, every multiple of 60. So again, only 60 in the first 100 numbers.

Therefore, all different approaches lead to the conclusion that the answer is 1.
Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 1. There's no ambiguity here. The LCM is 60, and only 60 is within the first 100 numbers.

One last check: Let's list all numbers from 1 to 100 and count those divisible by 3, 4, and 5. But that would be tedious, but maybe check a few points.

<prompt_3.2> Perform a final verification by listing numbers divisible by 3, 4, and 5 and checking against the first 100 positive integers as described in the above plan. </prompt_3.2>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
3 and 4 are coprime (they have no common factors other than 1), so LCM(3,4) is 3 x 4 = 12. Then, taking LCM of 12 and 5. Since 12 and 5 are coprime, LCM is 12 x 5 = 60. So, same result. Therefore, numbers divisible by 3,4,5 are multiples of 60. Hence, in 1-100, only 60.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
For example, 60 is divisible by all. 120 is next, but that's beyond 100. What about 30? 30 is divisible by 3 and 5, but not by 4 (30 ÷ 4 = 7.5). 20 is divisible by 4 and 5, but not by 3 (20 ÷ 3 ≈ 6.666). 12 is divisible by 3 and 4, but not by 5. So, none of the other numbers below 60 can be divisible by all three. So yes, only 60. 

Therefore, the answer is 1.

<Final_answer>
Therefore, there is only $\boxed{1}$ number among the first $100$ positive integers that is divisible by $3$, $4$, and $5$.
