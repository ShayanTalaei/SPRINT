Okay, so I need to find the horizontal asymptote for the function y = (4x³ + 2x - 4)/(3x³ - 2x² + 5x - 1). Hmm, horizontal asymptotes... I remember they have something to do with the behavior of the function as x approaches infinity or negative infinity. Let me try to recall the rules for determining horizontal asymptotes in rational functions.

First, a horizontal asymptote is a horizontal line that the graph of the function approaches as x tends towards positive or negative infinity. For rational functions, which are ratios of two polynomials, the degrees of the numerator and the denominator play a crucial role in determining the horizontal asymptote.

Let me think... If the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is y = 0. If the degree of the numerator is equal to the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is the ratio of the leading coefficients. And if the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator, there is no horizontal asymptote, but instead there might be an oblique (slant) asymptote.

Based on execution_1.1:
In this problem, the function is y = (4x³ + 2x - 4)/(3x³ - 2x² + 5x - 1). Let me check the degrees of the numerator and denominator.

<prompt_2.1> Determine the degrees of the numerator and denominator of the given rational function and apply the rules for horizontal asymptotes. </prompt_2.1>

Wait, let me make sure I didn't miss any steps here. Let me verify this by actually computing the limit as x approaches infinity.

<prompt_2.2> Verify the horizontal asymptote by computing the limit of the function as x approaches infinity. </prompt_2.2>

Just to be thorough, maybe I should also check the limit as x approaches negative infinity to see if it's the same. Let's do that.

<prompt_2.3> Check the limit of the function as x approaches negative infinity to confirm the horizontal asymptote. </prompt_2.3>

The numerator is 4x³ + 2x - 4, which is a cubic polynomial, so its degree is 3. The denominator is 3x³ - 2x² + 5x - 1, which is also a cubic polynomial, so its degree is 3. Since the degrees are equal, the horizontal asymptote should be the ratio of the leading coefficients. The leading coefficient of the numerator is 4 (from 4x³), and the leading coefficient of the denominator is 3 (from 3x³). Therefore, the horizontal asymptote is y = 4/3.

<execution_2.2>
Both the numerator and the denominator are polynomials. The numerator is a cubic polynomial (degree 3), and the denominator is also a cubic polynomial (degree 3). So their degrees are equal. According to the rules I remembered, when the degrees are equal, the horizontal asymptote is the ratio of the leading coefficients. The leading term of the numerator is 4x³, and the leading term of the denominator is 3x³. Therefore, the horizontal asymptote should be y = 4/3.

<execution_2.3>
As x approaches negative infinity, the highest degree terms still dominate. The numerator's leading term is still 4x³, and the denominator is 3x³. So even as x becomes a large negative number, the ratio (4x³)/(3x³) is still 4/3, because the negative signs cancel out when you divide. For example, (-4x³)/(-3x³) is still (4/3)x³/x³ = 4/3. Therefore, the limit as x approaches negative infinity is also 4/3.

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1, execution_2.2, execution_2.3:
So, both as x approaches positive infinity and negative infinity, the function approaches 4/3. Therefore, the horizontal asymptote is y = 4/3.

Let me think if there's any other way this could be approached. Maybe by dividing numerator and denominator by the highest power of x in the denominator, which is x³. Let's try that.

Divide both numerator and denominator by x³:

Numerator: (4x³ + 2x - 4)/x³ = 4 + 2/x² - 4/x³

Denominator: (3x³ - 2x² + 5x - 1)/x³ = 3 - 2/x + 5/x² - 1/x³

So the function becomes y = [4 + 2/x² - 4/x³] / [3 - 2/x + 5/x² - 1/x³]. Now, as x approaches infinity or negative infinity, the terms with 1/x, 1/x², and 1/x³ will approach zero. Therefore, the function simplifies to y = [4 + 0 - 0] / [3 + 0 + 0 - 0] = 4/3. That confirms the horizontal asymptote is indeed y = 4/3.

Is there any chance that I made a mistake here? Let me consider if there's a case where even though the degrees are equal, there's no horizontal asymptote. But according to what I know, if the degrees are equal, there is a horizontal asymptote at the ratio of the leading coefficients. So in this case, since both numerator and denominator are degree 3, there should be a horizontal asymptote at 4/3. There might be an oblique asymptote if the degree of the numerator is exactly one more than the denominator, but that's not the case here. So no, there's no oblique asymptote here.

Another way to check is to perform polynomial long division. Let's divide the numerator by the denominator. If we divide 4x³ + 2x -4 by 3x³ -2x² +5x -1, the first term of the quotient would be (4x³)/(3x³) = 4/3. Then, multiply the denominator by 4/3: (4/3)(3x³ -2x² +5x -1) = 4x³ - (8/3)x² + (20/3)x -4/3. Subtract this from the numerator:

<Final_answer>
Therefore, the value of $y$ at which there is a horizontal asymptote for the graph of the given equation is $\boxed{\frac{4}{3}}$.
