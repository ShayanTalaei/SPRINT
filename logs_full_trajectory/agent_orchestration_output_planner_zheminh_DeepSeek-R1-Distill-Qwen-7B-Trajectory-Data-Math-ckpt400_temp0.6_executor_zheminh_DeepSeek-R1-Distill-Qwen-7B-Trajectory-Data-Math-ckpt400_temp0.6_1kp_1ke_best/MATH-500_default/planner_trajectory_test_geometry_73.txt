Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how many cylindrical beakers of water it takes to fill a spherical tank. The beaker is 8 cm high with a radius of 3 cm, and the tank has a radius of 6 cm. Hmm, so first, I think I need to calculate the volume of the cylindrical beaker and the volume of the spherical tank. Then, divide the tank's volume by the beaker's volume to find out how many beakers are needed. That makes sense, right? Let me start with the formulas.

<prompt_1.1> Calculate the volume of the cylindrical beaker using the formula for the volume of a cylinder. </prompt_1.1>

Now, the spherical tank. The formula for the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³. The radius here is 6 cm. Let me compute that.

<prompt_1.2> Calculate the volume of the spherical tank using the formula for the volume of a sphere. </prompt_1.2>

The volume of a cylinder is πr²h. The radius is 3 cm and the height is 8 cm. So plugging in those numbers: V_cylinder = π * 3² * 8. Let me calculate that. 3 squared is 9, multiplied by 8 gives 72, so the volume is 72π cm³. Okay, that seems right.

<execution_1.2>
First, the sphere's volume: (4/3) * π * (6)^3. Let's calculate 6 cubed first. 6*6=36, 36*6=216. Then, (4/3)*216. 216 divided by 3 is 72, multiplied by 4 is 288. So the volume is 288π cm³.

Based on execution_1.1, execution_1.2:
Wait, so now I need to find how many times the beaker's volume fits into the tank's volume. So that's 288π divided by 72π. The π cancels out, which is nice.
So 288 divided by 72. Let me do that division. 72 times 4 is 288, so it's 4. So does that mean it takes 4 beakers to fill the tank?

Let me double-check my calculations to be sure.

<prompt_2.1> Verify the calculations for the volumes and the division result. </prompt_2.1>

But wait, hold on. Is there any chance I messed up the formulas? Let me confirm.

<prompt_2.2> Re-verify the formulas for the volumes of a cylinder and a sphere. </prompt_2.2>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Cylinder: radius 3, height 8. Volume πr²h = π*9*8=72π. Sphere: radius 6. Volume (4/3)πr³ = (4/3)π*216=288π. Dividing 288π by 72π gives 4.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Cylinder: πr²h. Yes, radius 3, height 8. 3 squared is 9, 9*8=72. Sphere: (4/3)πr³. Radius 6, so 6 cubed is 216. 216*(4/3) is indeed 288.

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Hmm. That seems straightforward, but maybe I should consider if there's any practical aspect, like whether the beakers can be perfectly filled or if there's any spillage.
But the problem doesn't mention any practical issues, so I think it's just a theoretical question. So the answer should be 4.

Wait, but let me visualize the sizes. The beaker is 8 cm high and 3 cm radius.

<prompt_3.1> Visualize the dimensions of the beaker and the tank to confirm the solution. </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
So the height is 8 cm, which is the same as the diameter of the sphere, which has a radius of 6 cm, so diameter is 12 cm. Wait, no, the sphere's diameter is 12 cm, but the beaker's height is 8 cm. So the beaker is shorter than the sphere's diameter. But the sphere's radius is 6 cm, so the beaker's height is 8 cm, which is actually larger than the sphere's radius. Hmm. But the beaker is cylindrical, so even though its height is 8 cm, the sphere is a three-dimensional shape. But in terms of volume, the calculation still holds. The sphere's volume is 288π, and each beaker is 72π, so 288 divided by 72 is 4. So 4 beakers.

<Final_answer>
Therefore, it would take $\boxed{4}$ cylindrical beakers to fill the spherical tank.
