Okay, let's see. The problem says that the product of three consecutive integers is 120. Then, when you divide that product by the mean of the three integers, you get 24. The question is asking for the largest of these three consecutive integers. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let's denote the three consecutive integers. Since they are consecutive, if I let the middle integer be x, then the three integers would be x-1, x, and x+1. That seems like a good approach because it centers the numbers around x, which might make the equations symmetric and easier to handle.

So, the product of these three integers is (x-1) * x * (x+1). The problem states that this product is 120. So, I can write the equation as:

(x - 1) * x * (x + 1) = 120

Let me compute that left side.
Multiplying (x - 1) and (x + 1) first, which is a difference of squares: (x^2 - 1). Then, multiplying that by x gives x(x^2 - 1) = x^3 - x. So, the equation becomes:

x^3 - x = 120

Which can be rewritten as:

x^3 - x - 120 = 0

Now, I need to solve this cubic equation. Let me think if there's an integer solution here. Since the product is 120, which is not too large, maybe x is a small integer. Let me test some integer values for x.

<prompt_1.1> Solve the cubic equation \(x^3 - x - 120 = 0\) by testing integer values. </prompt_1.1>

But wait, let me check the second part of the problem to make sure. The problem also says that the product divided by the mean of the three integers is 24. Let's verify that.

<prompt_1.2> Verify the second condition of the problem using the integers found. </prompt_1.2>

But let me check another possibility. Wait, maybe the three consecutive integers are not centered around the middle term? Wait, no, consecutive integers are always n-1, n, n+1. So that approach is correct.
Alternatively, maybe the problem is not about three consecutive integers but three consecutive numbers in some other way? Wait, the problem says "three consecutive integers," so they have to be n-1, n, n+1.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is not about integers? Wait, no, the question specifies "three consecutive integers," so they must be integers.

Let's try x=5: 5^3 -5 -120 = 125 -5 -120 = 0. Wait, that works! So x=5 is a solution. Therefore, the three integers are 4, 5, 6. Let me check the product: 4*5*6 = 120. Yep, that's correct.
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
The product is 120. The mean of the three integers is the average, which is ( (x - 1) + x + (x + 1) ) / 3. Simplifying the numerator: (x - 1 + x + x + 1) = 3x. So, the mean is 3x / 3 = x. So, the mean is x. Therefore, dividing the product by the mean gives 120 / x = 24. So, 120 divided by x is 24.

Based on execution_1.1:
But hold on, let me check if there are other possible solutions. Maybe negative integers? Let's see.

<prompt_2.1> Check if there are other integer solutions, including negative integers. </prompt_2.1>

But let me verify again. Let's compute the mean. The mean of 4,5,6 is (4+5+6)/3 = 15/3 = 5. Then, 120 divided by 5 is 24.

Alternatively, if there was another solution, say x=5, but we already have x=5. Are there other roots to the cubic equation? Let's check.

<prompt_2.2> Check for other roots of the cubic equation \(x^3 - x - 120 = 0\). </prompt_2.2>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
If x is negative, say x = -4: (-4)^3 - (-4) -120 = -64 +4 -120 = -180, which is not zero. How about x=6: 6^3 -6 -120 = 216 -6 -120 = 90, not zero. x=4: 64 -4 -120 = -60, not zero. x=3: 27 -3 -120 = -96, nope. So, x=5 is the only real integer solution here.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
The cubic equation x^3 - x - 120 = 0. We found x=5 is a root. Let's factor it out. Using polynomial division or synthetic division. Let's use synthetic division with x=5.

Coefficients of the cubic: 1 (x^3), 0 (x^2), -1 (x), -120 (constant).

Bring down the 1. Multiply by 5: 5. Add to next coefficient: 0 +5=5. Multiply by 5: 25. Add to next coefficient: -1 +25=24. Multiply by 5: 120. Add to last coefficient: -120 +120=0. So, the cubic factors into (x - 5)(x^2 +5x +24)=0.

Now, set x^2 +5x +24=0. Let's check the discriminant: 25 - 96 = -71. So, the other roots are complex. Therefore, the only real root is x=5.

Based on execution_2.1:
Therefore, the three integers are 4, 5, 6, and the largest is 6.

But wait, let me double-check everything.

<prompt_3.1> Double-check the solution to ensure all conditions are met. </prompt_3.1>

Based on execution_2.2:
Hence, the three integers are 4,5,6, and the largest is 6. Therefore, the answer is 6.

But just to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to interpret the problem. The problem says "the product divided by the mean of the three integers is 24".

<prompt_3.2> Explore alternative interpretations of the problem and confirm the solution. </prompt_3.2>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
The product is 4*5*6=120, which matches. The mean is (4+5+6)/3=15/3=5. Then, 120 divided by 5 is indeed 24. So, that's correct.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
Since the product is 120, and the mean is x, as we saw earlier, so 120 / x =24. Therefore, x=5. So that's straightforward. Therefore, the integers are 4,5,6. So, yes, the largest is 6.

Alternatively, is there a case where the three consecutive integers could be something else? For example, if they are not centered around the middle term? Wait, no, consecutive integers must be n-1, n, n+1. If you have three consecutive numbers, the middle one is the average. So, the mean is the middle number. Therefore, the mean is x, and the product is x(x-1)(x+1). So, the problem gives us that x(x-1)(x+1)=120 and 120 / x =24. Which leads us directly to x=5, so the numbers are 4,5,6. Therefore, the answer is 6.

I think that's solid. I don't see any other possibilities here. The equations lead directly to that solution, and checking the conditions confirms it.
