Okay, so I need to compute sin³ 18° + sin² 18°. Hmm, let me start by recalling some trigonometric identities and values. First, I know that sin 18° is a specific value that can be derived exactly. Maybe I should find the exact value of sin 18° first. Let me remember how that's done.

I recall that sin 18° is related to the golden ratio. Let me try to derive it.

<prompt_1.1> Use the above plan to find the exact value of sin 18°. </prompt_1.1>

Let's consider a regular pentagon. The internal angles are 108°, and if we draw some diagonals, we can form isosceles triangles with base angles of 72° and vertex angle of 36°, but maybe that's not directly helpful. Alternatively, maybe using a 5-pointed star, which involves 36° and 72° angles.

Alternatively, let's set up an equation. Let θ = 18°, so 5θ = 90°, so sin 5θ = sin 90° = 1. Using the multiple-angle formula for sine. The formula for sin 5θ can be expanded. Let me recall that sin 5θ = 16 sin^5 θ - 20 sin^3 θ + 5 sin θ. So setting θ = 18°, we have sin 5θ = sin 90° = 1. Therefore:

16 sin^5 18° - 20 sin^3 18° + 5 sin 18° = 1.

Let me let x = sin 18°, so the equation becomes:

16x^5 - 20x^3 + 5x - 1 = 0.

Based on execution_1.1:
Hmm, that's a fifth-degree equation. Maybe this can be factored. Let's try plugging in x=1 to see if it's a root.
Plugging x=1: 16 - 20 + 5 -1 = 0. Yes, x=1 is a root. So we can factor out (x - 1).

Let's perform polynomial division or use synthetic division.

<prompt_2.1> Perform polynomial division to factor out (x - 1) from the equation 16x^5 - 20x^3 + 5x - 1 = 0. </prompt_2.1>

Using synthetic division for x=1:

Coefficients: 16, 0, -20, 0, 5, -1

Bring down 16. Multiply by 1: 16. Add to next coefficient: 0 +16=16. Multiply by1:16. Add to next: -20 +16= -4. Multiply by1: -4. Add to next: 0 + (-4)= -4. Multiply by1: -4. Add to next:5 + (-4)=1. Multiply by1:1. Add to last: -1 +1=0. So the quotient is 16x^4 +16x^3 -4x^2 -4x +1. Therefore, the equation factors as (x -1)(16x^4 +16x^3 -4x^2 -4x +1)=0.

Based on execution_2.1:
Since x = sin 18° is not 1, we can ignore x=1 and focus on the quartic equation: 16x^4 +16x^3 -4x^2 -4x +1 =0.

Let me try to factor this quartic. Maybe it factors into quadratics. Let's suppose:

( ax^2 + bx + c )( dx^2 + ex + f ) = 16x^4 +16x^3 -4x^2 -4x +1.

<prompt_3.1> Attempt to factor the quartic equation 16x^4 + 16x^3 - 4x^2 - 4x + 1 = 0 into quadratics. </prompt_3.1>

Multiplying out:

(ad)x^4 + (ae + bd)x^3 + (af + be + cd)x^2 + (bf + ce)x + (cf).

We need ad=16, cf=1. Let's assume a and d are positive integers. Let's try a=4, d=4, since 4*4=16. Then c and f must multiply to 1. Let's take c=1, f=1. So:

(4x^2 + bx +1)(4x^2 + ex +1) = 16x^4 +16x^3 -4x^2 -4x +1.

Multiply out:

16x^4 + (4e +4b)x^3 + (4*1 + be +4*1)x^2 + (b + e)x +1.

Comparing coefficients:

4e +4b =16 => e + b =4.

Next coefficient: 4 + be +4 = be +8. But in the original quartic, the coefficient is -4. So be +8 = -4 => be = -12.

Next, the linear term: b + e = coefficient of x, which is -4. Wait, but earlier we had e + b =4 from the x^3 term. But here, the coefficient is -4. Wait, that's a conflict. Wait, let's check again.

Wait, in the quartic, the coefficients are 16x^4 +16x^3 -4x^2 -4x +1. So after expansion, the x term is (b + e)x. So according to the quartic, this coefficient is -4. Therefore, b + e = -4. But earlier from the x^3 term, we had e + b =4. That's a contradiction. Therefore, our assumption of a=4, d=4, c=1, f=1 is wrong.

Based on execution_3.1:
Let me try a different factorization. Maybe a=8, d=2? 8*2=16.

<prompt_4.1> Attempt different factorizations of the quartic equation and verify x = -1 as a root. </prompt_4.1>

So x=1 is a root, and the quartic factors as (x +1)(16x^3 -16x^2 -4x +1). Wait, let's check:

<prompt_4.2> Verify the factorization of the quartic equation using the roots x = 1 and x = -1. </prompt_4.2>

Now, we need to factor the cubic 16x^3 -16x^2 -4x +1. Let's try to find rational roots using Rational Root Theorem. Possible roots are ±1, ±1/2, ±1/4, ±1/8, ±1/16. Let's test x=1: 16 -16 -4 +1 = -3 ≠0. x=-1: -16 -16 +4 +1= -27≠0. x=1/2: 16*(1/8) -16*(1/4) -4*(1/2) +1= 2 -4 -2 +1= -3≠0. x= -1/2: 16*(-1/8) -16*(1/4) -4*(-1/2) +1= -2 -4 +2 +1= -3≠0. x=1/4: 16*(1/64) -16*(1/16) -4*(1/4) +1= 0.25 -1 -1 +1= -0.75≠0. x= -1/4: 16*(-1/64) -16*(1/16) -4*(-1/4) +1= -0.25 -1 +1 +1= 0.75≠0. x=1/8: 16*(1/512) -16*(1/64) -4*(1/8) +1= 0.03125 -0.25 -0.5 +1= 0.28125≠0. x= -1/8: Similarly, probably not zero. Hmm. Maybe there are no rational roots. Therefore, the cubic might be irreducible over rationals. So perhaps we need to use the method for solving cubics.

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in my approach. Let me check again.

<prompt_4.3> Re-evaluate the approach and consider alternative methods to find sin 18°. </prompt_4.3>

Then:

(8x^2 + bx + c)(2x^2 + ex + f) = 16x^4 +16x^3 -4x^2 -4x +1.

Multiply out:

16x^4 + (8e + 2b)x^3 + (8f + be + 2c)x^2 + (bf + ce)x + cf.

Set equal to original:

cf=1, so c=1, f=1.

Then:

8e + 2b =16 => 4e + b =8.

be + 8 + 2*1 = be +10. But original quartic has -4x^2, so be +10 = -4 => be = -14.

Then, bf + ce = b*1 + c*e = b + e. In the quartic, this coefficient is -4. So b + e = -4.

But from 4e + b =8 and b + e = -4. Let's solve these equations:

From b + e = -4, we have b = -4 - e.

Substitute into 4e + b =8:

4e + (-4 - e) =8 => 3e -4 =8 => 3e=12 => e=4.

Then, b = -4 -4= -8.

Check be = (-8)(4)= -32. But we needed be = -14. Not matching. So this factorization doesn't work.
</execution_4.1>

<execution_4.2>
(4x^2 + bx +1)(2x^2 + ex +1) = 8x^4 + (4e + 2b)x^3 + (4 + be + 2)x^2 + (b + e)x +1.

Set equal to 16x^4 +16x^3 -4x^2 -4x +1. Then:

4e + 2b =16,

4 + be + 2 = be +6 = -4 => be = -10,

b + e = -4.

So we have:

From 4e + 2b =16, divide by 2: 2e + b =8.

From b + e = -4.

Subtract the second equation from the first: (2e + b) - (b + e) =8 - (-4) => e =12. Then from b + e = -4, b= -16. Then check be = (-16)(12)= -192≠-10. Not good. So this factorization doesn't work.

<execution_4.3>
Alternatively, maybe instead of using the multiple-angle formula, use another identity. Let me recall that sin 18° = cos 72°, and perhaps use some complementary angle identities. Alternatively, use the identity for sin 3θ in terms of sin θ, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps use the exact value of sin 18° which is known to be (√5 -1)/4. Wait, let me check. I remember that sin 18° = (√5 -1)/4. Let me square that: [(√5 -1)/4]^2 = (5 - 2√5 +1)/16 = (6 - 2√5)/16 = (3 - √5)/8. Then sin² 18° + sin³ 18° would be (3 - √5)/8 + [(√5 -1)/4]^3. Let me compute that cube. [(√5 -1)/4]^3 = [(√5 -1)^3]/64. Let's expand (√5 -1)^3. Using binomial expansion: (√5)^3 + 3(√5)^2(-1) + 3(√5)(-1)^2 + (-1)^3 = 5√5 + 3*5*(-1) + 3√5*1 + (-1) = 5√5 -15 + 3√5 -1 = 8√5 -16. Therefore, [(√5 -1)/4]^3 = (8√5 -16)/64 = ( √5 -2 ) /8. Therefore, sin³ 18° + sin² 18° = (3 - √5)/8 + (√5 -2)/8 = [3 - √5 + √5 -2]/8 = (1)/8. So the answer is 1/8. Wait, that seems straightforward. So maybe the answer is 1/8. But how did I get that? Because I used the exact value of sin 18°, which is (√5 -1)/4. Let me confirm that value. Let me recall that in a regular pentagon, the sine of 18 degrees relates to the golden ratio. The exact value is indeed sin 18° = ( √5 -1 ) / 4. Let me check with approximate values. √5 ≈ 2.236, so √5 -1 ≈ 1.236. Divided by 4: ≈0.309. And sin 18° is approximately 0.3090, which matches. So that's correct. Therefore, sin 18° = (√5 -1)/4. Then, sin² 18° = [(√5 -1)/4]^2 = (5 - 2√5 +1)/16 = (6 - 2√5)/16 = (3 - √5)/8. Then sin³ 18° = sin 18° * sin² 18° = [(√5 -1)/4] * [(3 - √5)/8] = [ (√5 -1)(3 - √5) ] / 32. Let's compute the numerator: √5*3 + √5*(-√5) -1*3 +1*√5 = 3√5 -5 -3 +√5 = (3√5 + √5) + (-5 -3) = 4√5 -8. Therefore, sin³ 18° = (4√5 -8)/32 = (√5 -2)/8. Therefore, sin³ 18° + sin² 18° = (√5 -2)/8 + (3 - √5)/8 = [ (√5 -2) + (3 - √5) ] /8 = (√5 -2 +3 -√5)/8 = (1)/8. Therefore, the answer is 1/8. So that's the result.

Based on execution_4.3:
But let me verify this result another way to be sure. Let's compute sin 18° numerically and compute sin³ + sin² numerically.

<prompt_5.1> Verify the result sin³ 18° + sin² 18° = 1/8 using numerical computation. </prompt_5.1>
</Plan_5>

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
First, sin 18° ≈ 0.309016994. Then sin² 18° ≈ 0.309016994² ≈ 0.095491586. sin³ 18° ≈ 0.309016994³ ≈ 0.029429349. Adding them together: 0.095491586 + 0.029429349 ≈ 0.124920935. 1/8 is 0.125. So that's very close, which suggests that the exact value is indeed 1/8.
