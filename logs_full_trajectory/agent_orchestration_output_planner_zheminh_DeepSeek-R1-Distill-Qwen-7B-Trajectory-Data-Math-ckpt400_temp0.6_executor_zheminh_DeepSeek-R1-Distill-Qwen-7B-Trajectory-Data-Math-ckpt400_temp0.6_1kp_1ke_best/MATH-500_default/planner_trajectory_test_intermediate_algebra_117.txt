<Question>
Let $P(x)$ be a monic polynomial of degree 3.  Suppose that $P(x)$ has remainder $R(x)$ when it is divided by $(x - 1)(x - 4),$ and remainder $2R(x)$ when it is divided by $(x - 2)(x - 3).$  Given that $P(0) = 5,$ find $P(5).$

Okay, so I need to find P(5) where P(x) is a monic cubic polynomial. Let's start by recalling some polynomial division concepts. When a polynomial P(x) is divided by another polynomial, say Q(x), it can be expressed as P(x) = Q(x)*S(x) + T(x), where T(x) is the remainder, and its degree is less than the degree of Q(x). 

In this problem, P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), which is a quadratic polynomial. So the remainder R(x) should be of degree less than 2, meaning it's a linear polynomial. Let me write that as R(x) = ax + b, where a and b are constants I need to find.

Similarly, when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x).
That's a quadratic divisor, so the remainder would be of degree less than 2. But here it's given as 2R(x), which is 2(ax + b) = 2ax + 2b. Wait, but 2ax + 2b is still linear, so that's okay.

Given that P(x) is monic of degree 3, so leading coefficient is 1.

We also know that P(0) = 5.
So when x=0, P(0) = 5.

Let me structure the problem step by step.

First, express P(x) when divided by (x - 1)(x - 4):

<prompt_1.1> Express P(x) when divided by (x - 1)(x - 4) and set up the equation for P(0) = 5. </prompt_1.1>

Now, when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x). Let's write that division as well:

<prompt_1.2> Express P(x) when divided by (x - 2)(x - 3) and use the given condition to form another equation. </prompt_1.2>
-----

But let me check if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using the Chinese Remainder Theorem or something else.

Alternatively, since P(x) is a cubic polynomial, and we have information about remainders modulo two different quadratics, perhaps we can set up a system of equations.

<prompt_1.3> Explore an alternative method using the Chinese Remainder Theorem or interpolation to solve the problem. </prompt_1.3>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
So,

P(x) = (x - 1)(x - 4)S(x) + R(x)

where S(x) is some polynomial of degree 1 (since P is degree 3 and (x - 1)(x - 4) is degree 2). Let me denote S(x) as cx + d, so:

P(x) = (x - 1)(x - 4)(cx + d) + ax + b

Similarly, when divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x):

P(x) = (x - 2)(x - 3)T(x) + 2R(x)

where T(x) is another polynomial, probably of degree 1 as well. So:

P(x) = (x - 2)(x - 3)(ex + f) + 2ax + 2b

But since P(x) is the same polynomial, these two expressions must be equal for all x. So:

(x - 1)(x - 4)(cx + d) + ax + b = (x - 2)(x - 3)(ex + f) + 2ax + 2b

But maybe instead of equating these two expressions, which might be complicated, we can use the Remainder Factor Theorem. 

The Remainder Factor Theorem states that the remainder of a polynomial P(x) divided by (x - k) is P(k). However, here we are dividing by quadratic polynomials, so the remainder is a linear polynomial. But we can use the values at specific points to set up equations.
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
So:

P(x) = (x - 2)(x - 3)S(x) + 2ax + 2b.

But since P(x) is the same polynomial, these two expressions must be equal. Therefore:

(x - 1)(x - 4)S1(x) + ax + b = (x - 2)(x - 3)S2(x) + 2ax + 2b.

Hmm, not sure if that's immediately helpful. Maybe instead, since both divisions give us remainders, we can use the fact that P(x) evaluated at the roots of the divisors gives us the remainder evaluated at those roots.

For example, when dividing by (x - 1)(x - 4), the roots are x=1 and x=4. At these points, the remainder R(x) is equal to P(x) because the divisor becomes zero. So:

P(1) = R(1) = a*1 + b = a + b.

Similarly, P(4) = R(4) = a*4 + b = 4a + b.

On the other hand, when dividing by (x - 2)(x - 3), the roots are x=2 and x=3. The remainder there is 2R(x), so:

P(2) = 2R(2) = 2*(a*2 + b) = 4a + 2b.

P(3) = 2R(3) = 2*(a*3 + b) = 6a + 2b.

So now we have four equations:

1. P(1) = a + b.

2. P(4) = 4a + b.

3. P(2) = 4a + 2b.

4. P(3) = 6a + 6b? Wait, no. Wait, hold on. Wait, P(3) = 2R(3) = 2*(a*3 + b) = 6a + 2b. So equation 4 is P(3) = 6a + 2b.

But we also know that P(x) is a cubic polynomial. Since it's monic, it's x^3 + ... . But maybe we can use the values at x=0,1,2,3,4 to set up equations.

Wait, we know P(0) = 5. So that's another equation. Also, since P(x) is a cubic, if we can find its values at four points, we can determine it uniquely. But here, we have information at x=0,1,2,3,4. But maybe not all of them are independent.
</execution_1.2>

<execution_1.3>
Let me think.

Since (x - 1)(x - 4) and (x - 2)(x - 3) are two quadratics. Their least common multiple would be (x - 1)(x - 4)(x - 2)(x - 3), since they are coprime? Wait, are they coprime? Let's check if they share any common factors. (x - 1)(x - 4) and (x - 2)(x - 3) have no common factors, so their gcd is 1. Therefore, their LCM is the product. So, if we consider modulo the product, but perhaps this is overcomplicating.

Alternatively, since P(x) mod (x - 1)(x - 4) is R(x), which is a linear polynomial, and P(x) mod (x - 2)(x - 3) is 2R(x). So, perhaps we can use interpolation.

But maybe not necessary. The previous approach seems solid. Let's verify again.

Wait, another way: Since P(x) is cubic, and we can write it as P(x) = (x - 1)(x - 4)Q1(x) + R(x), and also as P(x) = (x - 2)(x - 3)Q2(x) + 2R(x). Then, if we subtract these two expressions:

(x - 1)(x - 4)Q1(x) - (x - 2)(x - 3)Q2(x) = R(x) - 2R(x) = -R(x)

But since P(x) is the same, so:

(x - 1)(x - 4)Q1(x) - (x - 2)(x - 3)Q2(x) = -R(x)

But this seems more complicated. Maybe not necessary.

Based on execution_1.1:
But we also know that P(0) = 5. Let's plug x = 0 into the first expression:

<prompt_2.1> Use the expression for P(x) when divided by (x - 1)(x - 4) and the given condition P(0) = 5 to find a system of equations. </prompt_2.1>
-----

Based on execution_1.2:
So let's summarize the equations we have:

1. P(0) = 5.

<prompt_2.2> List all the equations derived from the given conditions and the Remainder Factor Theorem. </prompt_2.2>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
P(0) = (0 - 1)(0 - 4)S(0) + R(0) = (-1)(-4)S(0) + R(0) = 4S(0) + b = 5.

But S(x) is a linear polynomial (since when we divide a cubic by a quadratic, the quotient is linear). Wait, earlier I considered S(x) as cx + d, but if P(x) is monic of degree 3, then (x - 1)(x - 4) is quadratic (degree 2), so the quotient S(x) must be linear (degree 1) to make the product (x - 1)(x - 4)S(x) have degree 2 + 1 = 3. So S(x) is linear: let's say S(x) = cx + d. Then:

P(x) = (x - 1)(x - 4)(cx + d) + ax + b.

Similarly, when divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x) = 2ax + 2b, so:

P(x) = (x - 2)(x - 3)(ex + f) + 2ax + 2b.

But since both expressions equal P(x), they must be equal to each other. However, equating them might be complicated. Instead, perhaps we can use the Remainder Factor Theorem and the given conditions to set up equations for the coefficients.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
2. P(1) = a + b.

3. P(2) = 4a + 2b.

4. P(3) = 6a + 2b.

5. P(4) = 4a + b.

So that's five equations. However, P(x) is a cubic polynomial with leading coefficient 1, so it has the form x^3 + px^2 + qx + r. Therefore, we can express P(x) as:

P(x) = x^3 + c x^2 + d x + e.

But since P(0) = 5, that means e = 5. So:

P(x) = x^3 + c x^2 + d x + 5.

Therefore, we can substitute x = 1, 2, 3, 4 into this expression and set them equal to the equations above. Let's do that.

Based on execution_2.1:
First, let's expand (x - 1)(x - 4)(cx + d). Let me compute that step by step.

<prompt_3.1> Expand the expression (x - 1)(x - 4)(cx + d) and write P(x) in terms of its coefficients. </prompt_3.1>
-----

Based on execution_2.2:
So P(1) = 1 + c + d + 5 = c + d + 6. But from equation 1, P(1) = a + b. So:

<prompt_3.2> Substitute x = 1, 2, 3, 4 into the polynomial P(x) and set up equations using the given remainders and P(0) = 5. </prompt_3.2>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
First, (x - 1)(x - 4) = x^2 - 5x + 4. Then multiply by (cx + d):

(x^2 - 5x + 4)(cx + d) = cx^3 + dx^2 -5c x^2 -5d x +4c x +4d.

Combine like terms:

= cx^3 + (d - 5c)x^2 + (-5d + 4c)x + 4d.

Then add the remainder ax + b:

So P(x) = cx^3 + (d - 5c)x^2 + (-5d + 4c + a)x + (4d + b).

But since P(x) is monic of degree 3, the coefficient of x^3 must be 1. Therefore, c = 1. So:

P(x) = x^3 + (d - 5*1)x^2 + (-5d + 4*1 + a)x + (4d + b).

Simplify:

= x^3 + (d - 5)x^2 + (-5d + 4 + a)x + (4d + b).
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
c + d + 6 = a + b.  (Equation A)

Similarly, P(2) = 8 + 4c + 2d + 5 = 4c + 2d + 13. From equation 3, P(2) = 4a + 2b. So:

4c + 2d + 13 = 4a + 2b.  (Equation B)

P(3) = 27 + 9c + 3d + 5 = 9c + 3d + 32. From equation 4, P(3) = 6a + 2b. So:

9c + 3d + 32 = 6a + 2b.  (Equation C)

P(4) = 64 + 16c + 4d + 5 = 16c + 4d + 69. From equation 5, P(4) = 4a + b. So:

16c + 4d + 69 = 4a + b.  (Equation D)

And we have equation 2: P(1) = a + b = c + d + 6. Wait, that's the same as Equation A. So equations A, B, C, D are the four equations we have.

Based on execution_3.1:
Next, the remainder when divided by (x - 2)(x - 3) is 2R(x) = 2ax + 2b. Let's use the same approach.

<prompt_4.1> Expand the expression (x - 2)(x - 3)(ex + f) and write P(x) in terms of its coefficients. </prompt_4.1>
-----

Based on execution_3.2:
So let's write down all four equations:

1. c + d + 6 = a + b.  (Equation A)

2. 4c + 2d + 13 = 4a + 2b.  (Equation B)

3. 9c + 3d + 32 = 6a + 2b.  (Equation C)

4. 16c + 4d + 69 = 4a + b.  (Equation D)

Our variables here are a, b, c, d. Since P(x) is a cubic monic polynomial, and we have expressed it in terms of c, d, a, b. But we need to solve these equations.

First, let's note that from Equation A: a + b = c + d + 6. Let's keep that in mind.

Let me try to eliminate variables. Let's look at Equations B, C, D.

<prompt_4.2> Solve the system of equations to find the values of a, b, c, and d. </prompt_4.2>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
First, (x - 2)(x - 3) = x^2 - 5x + 6. Multiply by (ex + f):

(x^2 - 5x + 6)(ex + f) = ex^3 + fx^2 -5e x^2 -5f x +6e x +6f.

Combine like terms:

= ex^3 + (f - 5e)x^2 + (-5f + 6e)x + 6f.

Add the remainder 2ax + 2b:

So P(x) = ex^3 + (f - 5e)x^2 + (-5f + 6e + 2a)x + (6f + 2b).

Again, since P(x) is monic of degree 3, the coefficient of x^3 must be 1. Therefore, e = 1. So:

P(x) = x^3 + (f - 5)x^2 + (-5f + 6 + 2a)x + (6f + 2b).
</execution_4.1>

<execution_4.2>
Equation B: 4c + 2d + 13 = 4a + 2b.

Equation D: 16c + 4d + 69 = 4a + b.

Let me subtract Equation B from Equation D to eliminate 4a + b. Wait, maybe first express 4a + 2b from Equation B:

From Equation B: 4a + 2b = 4c + 2d + 13.

Equation D: 4a + b = 16c + 4d + 69.

If we subtract Equation B from Equation D:

(4a + b) - (4a + 2b) = (16c + 4d + 69) - (4c + 2d + 13).

Simplify left side: -b.

Right side: 12c + 2d + 56.

Thus: -b = 12c + 2d + 56 => b = -12c - 2d - 56.  (Equation E)

Now, from Equation A: a + b = c + d + 6. So a = c + d + 6 - b. Substitute Equation E into this:

a = c + d + 6 - (-12c - 2d - 56) = c + d + 6 + 12c + 2d + 56 = 13c + 3d + 62.  (Equation F)

Now, let's substitute a and b from Equations E and F into Equation B:

Equation B: 4a + 2b = 4c + 2d + 13.

Substitute a and b:

4*(13c + 3d + 62) + 2*(-12c - 2d - 56) = 4c + 2d + 13.

Compute left side:

52c + 12d + 248 - 24c - 4d - 112 = (52c -24c) + (12d -4d) + (248 -112) = 28c + 8d + 136.

Set equal to right side:

28c + 8d + 136 = 4c + 2d + 13.

Subtract 4c + 2d +13 from both sides:

24c + 6d + 123 = 0.

Divide both sides by 3:

8c + 2d + 41 = 0.  (Equation G)

Similarly, let's use Equation C: 9c + 3d + 32 = 6a + 2b.

Substitute a and b from Equations E and F:

6*(13c + 3d + 62) + 2*(-12c -2d -56) = 9c + 3d + 32.

Compute left side:

78c + 18d + 372 -24c -4d -112 = (78c -24c) + (18d -4d) + (372 -112) = 54c + 14d + 260.

Set equal to right side:

54c + 14d + 260 = 9c + 3d + 32.

Subtract 9c + 3d +32 from both sides:

45c + 11d + 228 = 0.  (Equation H)

So now we have Equations G and H:

Equation G: 8c + 2d = -41.

Equation H: 45c + 11d = -228.

We can solve this system. Let's first simplify Equation G:

Divide by 2: 4c + d = -41/2 => d = -41/2 -4c.

Wait, but dealing with fractions might be cumbersome. Let me check if I made an error in calculation.

Wait, let's retrace steps:

From Equation G: 8c + 2d +41 =0 => 8c +2d = -41.

Equation H:45c +11d = -228.

Let me write them as:

1. 8c + 2d = -41. (Equation G)

2. 45c +11d = -228. (Equation H)

Let's solve this system.

Multiply Equation G by 11/2 to eliminate d:

(8c + 2d)*11/2 = (-41)*11/2 => 44c +11d = -451/2.

But Equation H is 45c +11d = -228.

Subtract Equation G*11/2 from Equation H:

(45c +11d) - (44c +11d) = -228 - (-451/2).

Simplify:

c = -228 + 451/2 = (-456/2 + 451/2) = (-5)/2.

Thus, c = -5/2.

Now substitute c = -5/2 into Equation G:

8*(-5/2) + 2d = -41.

Compute 8*(-5/2) = -20.

So:

-20 + 2d = -41 => 2d = -21 => d = -21/2.

So d = -21/2.

Now, from Equation E: b = -12c -2d -56.

Substitute c = -5/2, d = -21/2:

b = -12*(-5/2) -2*(-21/2) -56 = 30 +21 -56 = 3.

So b = 3.

From Equation F: a =13c +3d +62.

Substitute c = -5/2, d = -21/2:

a =13*(-5/2) +3*(-21/2) +62 = (-65/2) + (-63/2) +62 = (-128/2) +62 = -64 +62 = -2.

So a = -2.

From the above, we found:

a = -2, b = 3, c = -5/2, d = -21/2.

P(x) = x^3 + c x^2 + d x + 5, since e =5 from P(0)=5.

But here, c and d are different from the a and b in the remainder. Wait, no. Wait, in the previous steps, when we expressed P(x) in terms of the quotient S(x) = cx + d, we found c=1 (since monic), leading to coefficients in terms of c and d. Then, the remainder R(x) = ax + b. Then, later when expressing the other division, we did the same with ex + f, found e=1, and remainder 2ax + 2b.

But in the equations, a and b in the remainder are different from the a and b in the polynomial? Wait, no. Wait, actually, the remainder when divided by (x -1)(x -4) is R(x) = ax + b, which is the same ax + b as in the division expression. Then, when divided by (x -2)(x -3), the remainder is 2R(x) = 2ax + 2b. So the same a and b. So in the polynomial, the coefficients are a and b for the remainder, and in the other division, they are doubled. So in our equations, a and b are the same in both cases.

But when we expanded P(x) in terms of the quotient S(x) = cx + d, we had:

P(x) = (x^2 -5x +4)(x + d) + ax + b. Wait, no, S(x) was cx + d, but since P(x) is monic cubic, c=1, so S(x) = x + d. Therefore, expanding that, we had:

P(x) = x^3 + (d -5)x^2 + (-5d +4 +a)x + (4d + b).

But we also know that P(0) =5, so plugging x=0:

P(0) = 0 + 0 + 0 + (4d + b) =4d + b =5.

So equation 1:4d + b =5.

Similarly, from the other division, P(x) = (x^2 -5x +6)(x + f) +2ax +2b. Then, expanding:

P(x) =x^3 + (f -5)x^2 + (-5f +6 +2a)x + (6f +2b).

And P(0)=6f +2b=5.

So equation 5:6f +2b=5.

But in our previous notation, when we expressed P(x) in terms of the quotient and remainder, we had:

From first division:

P(x) =x^3 + (d -5)x^2 + (-5d +4 +a)x + (4d + b).

From second division:

P(x)=x^3 + (f -5)x^2 + (-5f +6 +2a)x + (6f +2b).

But since both expressions are equal, their coefficients must be equal. Therefore:

Coefficients of x^2: d -5 = f -5 => d = f.

Coefficients of x: -5d +4 +a = -5f +6 +2a.

But since d = f, substitute:

-5d +4 +a = -5d +6 +2a.

Subtract -5d from both sides:

4 +a =6 +2a => 4 -6 = 2a -a => -2 =a.

So a = -2.

Then, constant term:4d + b =6f +2b. Since d =f:

4d + b =6d +2b =>4d +b -6d -2b=0 => -2d -b=0 => b= -2d.

So from here, b = -2d.

Earlier, we had from equation E: b = -12c -2d -56. But c was found to be -5/2. Let's check:

b = -12*(-5/2) -2d -56 =30 -2d -56= -26 -2d.

But according to this new relation, b = -2d. Therefore:

-2d = -26 -2d => Adding 2d to both sides: 0 = -26. Wait, that's a contradiction. That suggests an error in my reasoning.

Wait, this is a problem. So this suggests that my approach has a mistake.

P(x) = x^3 + c x^2 + d x + 5 (since P(0) =5, so e=5).

Substituting c and d:

P(x) = x^3 + (-5/2)x^2 + (-21/2)x +5.

But let's verify this with the given conditions to ensure correctness.

First, check P(0) = 0 +0 +0 +5 =5. Correct.

Now, check the remainders.

First division by (x -1)(x -4):

Remainder R(x) = ax + b = -2x +3.

So P(1) = R(1) = -2*1 +3 =1. Let's compute P(1):

P(1) =1 + (-5/2)(1) + (-21/2)(1) +5 =1 -5/2 -21/2 +5.

Convert to halves:

= 2/2 -5/2 -21/2 +10/2 = (2 -5 -21 +10)/2 = (-14)/2 = -7. Wait, but according to R(1) it should be 1. This is a problem. There's a discrepancy here.

Wait, something is wrong. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, hold on. If P(x) = x^3 + c x^2 + d x +5, and c = -5/2, d = -21/2, then:

P(1) = 1^3 + (-5/2)(1)^2 + (-21/2)(1) +5 =1 -5/2 -21/2 +5.

Compute step by step:

1 is 1.

-5/2 is -2.5.

-21/2 is -10.5.

+5 is +5.

Adding these: 1 -2.5 = -1.5; -1.5 -10.5 = -12; -12 +5 = -7. But according to the remainder when divided by (x -1)(x -4), which is R(x) = -2x +3, then P(1) should be R(1) = -2 +3 =1. But according to the polynomial, P(1) is -7. That's a contradiction. So there must be an error in my calculations.

Wait, let's retrace. Let's go back.

We had:

From Equation G: 8c +2d = -41.

Equation H:45c +11d = -228.

We solved and found c = -5/2, d = -21/2.

But plugging back into Equation G:

8*(-5/2) +2*(-21/2) = -20 -21 = -41. Correct. So that's okay.

But when we constructed P(x), we had c = -5/2 and d = -21/2. But according to the Remainder Theorem, P(1) should equal R(1) = a*1 + b = -2 +3 =1. However, when plugging into P(x), we get -7. So that's a problem.

Therefore, there must be an error in the setup of equations. Let's go back step by step.

Based on execution_5.2:
**Re-evaluating the Approach:**

Let me start over.

We have P(x) is a cubic monic polynomial. When divided by (x -1)(x -4), the remainder is R(x) = ax + b. Therefore, by the Remainder Theorem:

<prompt_6.1> Re-evaluate the approach and correct the construction of the polynomial. </prompt_6.1>
</Plan_6>

<Execution_6>
<execution_6.1>
P(1) = R(1) = a*1 + b = a + b.

P(4) = R(4) = a*4 + b = 4a + b.

Similarly, when P(x) is divided by (x -2)(x -3), the remainder is 2R(x). Therefore:

P(2) = 2R(2) = 2*(2a + b) = 4a + 2b.

P(3) = 2R(3) = 2*(3a + b) = 6a + 2b.

Additionally, we know P(0) = 5. So P(0) = constant term = 5. Since P(x) is cubic monic, let's write P(x) as x^3 + px^2 + qx + 5.

Then, using the above conditions:

1. P(1) = 1 + p + q + 5 = p + q + 6 = a + b. (Equation 1)

2. P(4) = 64 + 16p + 4q + 5 = 69 + 16p + 4q = 4a + b. (Equation 2)

3. P(2) = 8 + 4p + 2q + 5 = 13 + 4p + 2q = 4a + 2b. (Equation 3)

4. P(3) = 27 + 9p + 3q + 5 = 32 + 9p + 3q = 6a + 2b. (Equation 4)

Now, we have four equations with variables p, q, a, b. Let's solve them step by step.

First, subtract Equation 3 from Equation 2:

Equation 2: 69 + 16p + 4q = 4a + b.

Equation 3: 13 + 4p + 2q = 4a + 2b.

Subtract Equation 3 from Equation 2:

(69 -13) + (16p -4p) + (4q -2q) = (4a -4a) + (b -2b).

56 + 12p + 2q = -b. (Equation 5)

Similarly, subtract Equation 3 multiplied by 2 from Equation 4:

Equation 4: 32 + 9p + 3q = 6a + 2b.

2*Equation 3: 26 + 8p + 4q = 8a + 4b.

Subtract:

(32 -26) + (9p -8p) + (3q -4q) = (6a -8a) + (2b -4b).

6 + p - q = -2a -2b. (Equation 6)

Now, from Equation 1: a + b = p + q +6. Let's denote this as Equation 1.

Equation 6 can be rewritten as:

-2a -2b = 6 + p - q => Divide both sides by -2:

a + b = (-6 - p + q)/2. (Equation 6a)

But from Equation 1, a + b = p + q +6. Therefore:

p + q +6 = (-6 - p + q)/2.

Multiply both sides by 2:

2p + 2q +12 = -6 -p + q.

Bring all terms to left side:

2p +2q +12 +6 +p -q =0 => 3p + q +18 =0. (Equation 7)

Now, from Equation 5: 56 +12p +2q = -b.

From Equation 1: a = p + q +6 - b. Substitute into Equation 6a:

(p + q +6 - b) + b = (-6 -p + q)/2.

Simplify left side: p + q +6.

Thus:

p + q +6 = (-6 -p + q)/2.

Multiply both sides by 2:

2p + 2q +12 = -6 -p + q.

Bring all terms to left:

2p +2q +12 +6 +p -q =0 =>3p +q +18=0. Which is the same as Equation 7. So no new information.

So we need another approach. Let's use Equation 5 and Equation 7.

From Equation 7:3p + q = -18. So q = -18 -3p.

Substitute q into Equation 5:

56 +12p +2*(-18 -3p) = -b.

Compute:

56 +12p -36 -6p = -b =>20 +6p = -b => b = -20 -6p. (Equation 8)

Now, from Equation 1: a = p + q +6 - b.

Substitute q and b:

q = -18 -3p, b = -20 -6p.

Thus:

a = p + (-18 -3p) +6 - (-20 -6p) = p -18 -3p +6 +20 +6p = (p -3p +6p) + (-18 +6 +20) =4p +8. (Equation 9)

Now, we can use Equation 3:13 +4p +2q =4a +2b.

Substitute q, a, b:

q = -18 -3p, a =4p +8, b =-20 -6p.

Left side:13 +4p +2*(-18 -3p) =13 +4p -36 -6p = -22 -2p.

Right side:4*(4p +8) +2*(-20 -6p) =16p +32 -40 -12p =4p -8.

Thus:

-22 -2p =4p -8.

Bring variables to left and constants to right:

-22 +8 =4p +2p.

-14 =6p => p = -14/6 = -7/3 ≈ -2.333...

Hmm, p is -7/3. Then, substitute back into q = -18 -3p:

q = -18 -3*(-7/3) = -18 +7 = -11.

Then, from Equation 8: b = -20 -6p = -20 -6*(-7/3) = -20 +14 = -6.

From Equation 9: a =4p +8 =4*(-7/3) +8 = -28/3 +24/3 = (-28 +24)/3 = -4/3 ≈ -1.333...

Therefore, the polynomial is:

P(x) =x^3 + (-7/3)x^2 -11x -6.

Wait, but let's check if this satisfies all the conditions.

First, P(0) = -6. But the problem states P(0)=5. This is a problem. So there's a mistake here. Wait, no. Wait, in our setup, we said P(x) =x^3 + px^2 + qx + e, and e =5. So P(0) = e =5. But in this case, e is 5. However, in the above, when we constructed P(x), we set e=5. But in the process, when we expanded P(x) in terms of the quotient and remainder, we had:
