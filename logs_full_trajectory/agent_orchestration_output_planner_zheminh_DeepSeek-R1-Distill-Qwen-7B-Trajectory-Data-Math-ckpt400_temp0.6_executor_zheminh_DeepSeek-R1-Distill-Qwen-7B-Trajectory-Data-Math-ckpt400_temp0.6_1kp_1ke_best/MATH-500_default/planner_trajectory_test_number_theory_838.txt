If $x^3$ is a positive factor of $10!,$ how many possible integer values of $x$ are there?  (Reminder: For a positive integer $n$, the expression $n!$ stands for the product of the integers from 1 up to (and including) $n$.)

Okay, let's see. The problem is asking: If x³ is a positive factor of 10!, how many possible integer values of x are there? Hmm, right. So first, I need to understand what this means. Let me break it down step by step.

<prompt_1.1> Understand the problem statement and identify the necessary steps to solve it. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
So, 10! is 10 factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to 10. The prime factors of 10! will be important here, right? Because if x³ is a factor of 10!, then the prime factors of x³ must be a subset of the prime factors of 10!. 

First, maybe I should find the prime factorization of 10! . Let me do that. Let's list the primes up to 10: they are 2, 3, 5, 7. Now, let's find the exponents for each prime in 10! .

Starting with 2: how many times does 2 appear in the factors of 10! ?

</Execution_1>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Using the formula for finding exponents in factorials: divide 10 by 2, then 10 by 4, 10 by 8, etc. , and take the floor each time.

<prompt_2.1> Calculate the exponent of prime 2 in the prime factorization of 10!. </prompt_2.1>

Next, 3: same process.
10 divided by 3 is 3 (floor), 10 divided by 9 is 1 (floor). So exponent of 3 is 3 + 1 = 4.

For 5: 10 divided by 5 is 2, and 10 divided by 25 is 0, so exponent is 2.

For 7: 10 divided by 7 is 1, and higher powers are 0, so exponent is 1.
So the prime factorization of 10! is 2^8 * 3^4 * 5^2 * 7^1.

Now, x³ must be a factor of 10! . So, if x is an integer, then x³ can be written as a product of primes raised to exponents that are multiples of 3 (since x is cubed).
But x³ has to divide 10! , which has exponents 8,4,2,1 for primes 2,3,5,7 respectively.

Therefore, the exponents in x³ for each prime can't exceed those in 10! .

Let me formalize this. Let x have the prime factorization x = 2^a * 3^b * 5^c * 7^d. Then x³ = 2^(3a) * 3^(3b) * 5^(3c) * 7^(3d). For x³ to divide 10! , the exponents 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d must be less than or equal to 8,4,2,1 respectively.

So, for each prime, we need to find the possible exponents a, b, c, d such that 3a ≤ 8, 3b ≤4, 3c ≤2, 3d ≤1. Then, the number of possible x is the product of the number of possible exponents for each prime.

Let me handle each prime one by one.

Starting with prime 2: 3a ≤8.

<prompt_2.2> Determine the number of possible values for the exponent of prime 2 in x. </prompt_2.2>

Next, prime 3: 3b ≤4.

<prompt_2.3> Determine the number of possible values for the exponent of prime 3 in x. </prompt_2.3>

Prime 5: 3c ≤2.

<prompt_2.4> Determine the number of possible values for the exponent of prime 5 in x. </prompt_2.4>

Prime 7: 3d ≤1.

<prompt_2.5> Determine the number of possible values for the exponent of prime 7 in x. </prompt_2.5>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
So:

For 2: 10/2 = 5, 10/4 = 2, 10/8 = 1, 10/16 = 0. So total exponent is 5 + 2 + 1 = 8.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
So a can be 0,1,2 because 3*3=9 which is more than 8. So a ∈ {0,1,2}. That's 3 possibilities.

Prime 3: 3b ≤4. Similarly, b can be 0,1 since 3*2=6 >4. So b ∈ {0,1}. That's 2 possibilities.

Prime 5: 3c ≤2. Then c can only be 0, because 3*1=3 >2. So c=0. Only 1 possibility.

Prime 7: 3d ≤1. Similarly, d can only be 0, since 3*1=3 >1. So d=0. Also 1 possibility.
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
So 3b can be 0,3,6 (since 3*2=6, 3*3=9 which is more than 4). Wait, 3b ≤4. So possible values for 3b are 0,3. Because 6 is already 6, which is greater than 4. Wait, 3*1=3, 3*2=6. But 6 is more than 4, so only 0 and 3. Therefore, b can be 0 or 1 (since 3b=0 ⇒ b=0, 3b=3 ⇒ b=1). So two choices for b.

Wait, let me check again. If 3b ≤4, then b can be 0,1 since 3*1=3 ≤4, and 3*2=6 >4. So yes, b=0 or 1. So two options.
</execution_2.3>

<execution_2.4>
Since 3c must be an integer ≤2. The possible values for 3c are 0 and maybe 3? Wait, 3c ≤2, so 3c can be 0 or 1 or 2? Wait, no. Because 3c has to be a multiple of 3. Wait, hold on. If x is an integer, then the exponents a, b, c, d are non-negative integers. Therefore, 3a, 3b, etc. , must also be non-negative integers. So, for 3c ≤2, the possible values of 3c are 0, since 3*1=3 which is already greater than 2. So only c=0 is possible. So, c must be 0. Similarly for d: 3d ≤1. So 3d can only be 0. Therefore, d=0.

Wait, is that correct? Let me check.

For prime 5: exponent in x³ is 3c. This must be ≤2. Since 3c can be 0, 3, 6, etc. But 3 is already larger than 2, so the only possible value is 0. So c must be 0. Similarly for prime 7: 3d ≤1, so 3d can only be 0. Hence, d=0.

Therefore, x cannot have primes 5 or 7 in its factorization. So, x must be of the form 2^a * 3^b, where a and b are non-negative integers such that 3a ≤8 and 3b ≤4. Then, the exponents for 5 and 7 in x must be 0.
</execution_2.4>

<execution_2.5>
Since exponents a, b, c, d are non-negative integers (they can be zero, meaning the prime isn't present in x). 

So for each prime, find the number of possible non-negative integers (a, b, c, d) satisfying those inequalities.
</execution_2.5>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.2, execution_2.3, execution_2.4, execution_2.5:
So, the number of possible x is the number of combinations of a, b, c, d.

Since c and d must be 0, there's only 1 choice each.

<prompt_3.1> Calculate the total number of possible integer values of x. </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
For a, there are 3 choices (0,1,2), and for b, there are 2 choices (0,1). Therefore, total x's are 3 * 2 * 1 * 1 = 6.

Wait, so the total number of possible x is 6?
</execution_3.1>
</Execution_3>

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
Let me verify this.

Let's list all possible x.

<prompt_4.1> List all possible integer values of x and verify their cubes divide 10!. </prompt_4.1>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
Since x is 2^a * 3^b, with a=0,1,2 and b=0,1.

Possible combinations:

a=0, b=0: x=1. x³=1, which divides 10! .

a=0, b=1: x=3. x³=27. Check if 27 divides 10! . 10! = 3628800. 3628800 ÷27= 134400. Which is an integer. So yes.

a=1, b=0: x=2. x³=8. 8 divides 10! .

a=1, b=1: x=2*3=6. x³=216. 10! ÷216= 3628800 ÷216=16800. Integer. So yes.

a=2, b=0: x=4. x³=64. 64 divides 10! ? Let's check. 10! = 3628800. 3628800 ÷64=56700. Which is an integer. So yes.

a=2, b=1: x=4*3=12. x³=1728. 3628800 ÷1728=2100. Integer. So yes.

So all 6 values: 1, 3, 2, 6, 4, 12. Their cubes all divide 10! .

Therefore, the answer should be 6.

</Execution_4>

<Plan_5>
Based on execution_4.1:
Wait, but hold on. Let me check if there are any other possibilities. For example, can x have exponents for 5 or 7?

<prompt_5.1> Confirm the final answer by checking all possibilities and ensuring no other values of x are possible. </prompt_5.1>
</Plan_5>

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
But according to earlier reasoning, since in x³, the exponents for 5 and 7 would be 3c and 3d, which need to be ≤2 and ≤1 respectively. So 3c ≤2 implies c=0, similarly 3d ≤1 implies d=0. Therefore, x cannot have 5 or 7 as prime factors. So only 2 and 3 are possible primes in x.

Therefore, the total number of x is 3*2=6.

But let me just confirm if I didn't miss any other possibilities. For example, could x have exponent 3 for prime 2? But 3a ≤8. If a=3, then 3a=9, which is more than 8, so x³ would have 2^9, which is more than 10! 's 2^8. So that's not allowed. So a can only be 0,1,2. Similarly, b=0,1 only. So yes, 3 and 2 choices. So 3*2=6.

Therefore, the answer should be 6. So the number of possible integer values of x is 6.
</execution_5.1>
</Execution_5>

<Final_answer>
Therefore, there are $\boxed{6}$ possible integer values of $x$ such that $x^3$ is a positive factor of $10!$.
