Okay, let's see. I need to find the value of 5 star 1 using this operation defined as a star b equals 9a plus 2b minus ab plus 5. Hmm, operations like this can sometimes be confusing at first, but maybe if I break it down step by step, it'll make more sense.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. The star operation is a binary operation, meaning it takes two numbers, a and b, and combines them according to the given formula. So, when they ask for 5 star 1, that translates to substituting a = 5 and b = 1 into the equation 9a + 2b - ab + 5.

Let me write that out to visualize it better.
So, substituting the values, it would be 9 times 5 plus 2 times 1 minus 5 times 1 plus 5.

Let me check if I substituted correctly. The first term is 9a, so 9*5.
The second term is 2b, so 2*1. Then the third term is -ab, which is -5*1, and the last term is +5.

Now, let me compute each term step by step to avoid mistakes. Starting with the first term: 9 multiplied by 5.
That's straightforward, 9*5 is 45.

Next term is 2 multiplied by 1.
2*1 is 2. So adding that to the previous result, it's 45 + 2.

Then the third term is -5*1.
So that's -5. Subtracting 5 from the previous total: 45 + 2 is 47, minus 5 is 42.

Finally, the last term is +5.
Adding 5 to 42 gives 47.

Wait, let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't mix up any numbers or operations.

<prompt_1.1> Verify each step of the calculation to ensure no mistakes were made. </prompt_1.1>

But let me double-check in case I made an arithmetic error. Let's recalculate:

<prompt_1.2> Recalculate the expression to check for arithmetic errors. </prompt_1.2>

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't misinterpret the operation. The problem defines a star b as 9a + 2b - ab + 5.
So the order matters here because a and b are in different positions in the terms. For example, the term with a is 9a, and the term with b is 2b, but then there's the -ab term which is a product of a and b. So substituting a =5 and b=1, we have to ensure that we replace a with 5 and b with 1 in all instances.

Let me write it out again as per the definition:

<prompt_1.3> Re-evaluate the operation definition and verify the substitution of variables. </prompt_1.3>

Alternatively, maybe I can compute it all in one go:

<prompt_1.4> Explore an alternative method to compute the expression and verify the result. </prompt_1.4>

But just to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to approach this problem or if there's a property of the star operation that I might be missing. For example, is the star operation commutative?
That is, does a star b equal b star a? Well, in this case, if we swap a and b, we would get 9b + 2a - ba +5, which is different from the original expression because the coefficients for a and b are different (9a vs 2a when swapped). So, it's not commutative. But in this problem, we were specifically asked for 5 star 1, so commutativity isn't an issue here.

Another thing to check: did I apply the order of operations correctly? The expression is 9a + 2b - ab +5.

<prompt_1.5> Verify the order of operations and the application of parentheses in the expression. </prompt_1.5>

Alternatively, maybe I can use parentheses to clarify:

Let me just recap the steps one more time to ensure there's no oversight:

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
First term: 9*5=45. Correct. Second term: 2*1=2. Correct. Third term: -5*1=-5. Correct. Fourth term: +5. Correct.
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
9a where a is 5: 9*5 = 45. Correct.

2b where b is 1: 2*1 = 2. Correct.

-ab where a is 5 and b is 1: -5*1 = -5. Correct.

+5: straightforward. 

So adding them all up: 45 + 2 = 47. Then 47 - 5 = 42. Then 42 + 5 = 47.
</execution_1.2>

<execution_1.3>
a star b = 9a + 2b - ab + 5.

So substituting a = 5 and b = 1:

First term: 9*5 = 45.

Second term: 2*1 = 2.

Third term: -5*1 = -5.

Fourth term: +5.

So adding them all up: 45 + 2 - 5 + 5.
</execution_1.3>

<execution_1.4>
5 star 1 = 9*(5) + 2*(1) - (5)*(1) + 5

Calculating each term:

9*5 = 45

2*1 = 2

5*1 = 5

So substituting back: 45 + 2 - 5 + 5

Now, adding and subtracting from left to right:

45 + 2 = 47

47 - 5 = 42

42 + 5 = 47
</execution_1.4>

<execution_1.5>
Since there are no parentheses, it's just multiplication and addition/subtraction. Multiplication comes before addition and subtraction, so the terms 9a, 2b, and -ab are all computed first, then added or subtracted. So yes, the way I broke it down earlier is correct.
</execution_1.5>

<execution_1.6>
9a + (2b) + (-ab) + 5. Since multiplication comes before addition and subtraction, the terms 9a, 2b, and -ab are all computed first, then added or subtracted. So the way I broke it down earlier is correct: 9*5, 2*1, -5*1, then +5.
</execution_1.6>

<execution_1.7>
1. Substitute a = 5 and b = 1 into the expression 9a + 2b - ab + 5.
2. Compute each term:
   - 9a = 9*5 = 45
   - 2b = 2*1 = 2
   - ab = 5*1 = 5 (with a negative sign, so -5)
   - Constant term +5
3. Sum all terms: 45 + 2 - 5 + 5.

Based on execution_1.1, execution_1.2, execution_1.3, execution_1.4, execution_1.5, execution_1.6, execution_1.7:
I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning here. Each step follows logically, and the substitutions are correct.
The arithmetic checks out each time I recalculate.
