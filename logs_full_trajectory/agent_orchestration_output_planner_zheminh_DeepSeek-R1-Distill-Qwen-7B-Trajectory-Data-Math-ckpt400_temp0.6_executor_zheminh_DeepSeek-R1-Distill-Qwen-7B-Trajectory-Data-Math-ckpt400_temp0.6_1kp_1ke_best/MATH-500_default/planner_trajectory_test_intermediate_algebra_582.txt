Okay, so I need to solve this equation: \(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\). It has 10 complex roots, which come in conjugate pairs. The problem is asking for the sum of the reciprocals of the product of each root and its conjugate. That is, if the roots are \(r_1, \overline{r}_1, r_2, \overline{r}_2, \ldots, r_5, \overline{r}_5\), then I need to compute \(\frac{1}{r_1 \overline{r}_1} + \frac{1}{r_2 \overline{r}_2} + \ldots + \frac{1}{r_5 \overline{r}_5}\).

First, let me recall that for a complex number \(r\), the product \(r \overline{r}\) is equal to the square of its modulus, \(|r|^2\). So each term \(\frac{1}{r_i \overline{r}_i}\) is actually \(\frac{1}{|r_i|^2}\). Therefore, the sum we need is the sum of the reciprocals of the squared moduli of each pair of conjugate roots.

But how do I find this sum? Hmm. Maybe I can use properties of polynomials and their roots. The given equation is a polynomial equation of degree 10, since the highest power of x is 10. The roots are given as five conjugate pairs, which makes sense because the coefficients of the polynomial are real numbers (assuming the original equation has real coefficients, which it does except for the term \(x^{10}\) and \((13x -1)^{10}\), but let me check: substituting x with \(\overline{x}\) in the equation, we get \(\overline{x}^{10} + (13 \overline{x} -1)^{10}\), which is the conjugate of the original equation's left-hand side.
Therefore, if x is a root, then \(\overline{x}\) is also a root. So the roots come in conjugate pairs, as stated. Therefore, the polynomial is of degree 10 with real coefficients.

So, if I can find the polynomial whose roots are \(r_i\) and \(\overline{r}_i\), then perhaps I can use Vieta's formula to find the sum of reciprocals of \(r_i \overline{r}_i\).

But the original equation is \(x^{10} + (13x -1)^{10} = 0\). Let me write that as \(x^{10} = - (13x -1)^{10}\). Taking the 10th root on both sides, we get \(x = \omega (13x -1)\), where \(\omega\) is a 10th root of -1.

<prompt_1.1> Analyze the roots of the equation by taking the 10th root of both sides and describe the roots. </prompt_1.1>

Wait, but let me check if this is correct.
Let me verify with a simpler case. Suppose instead of 10, the exponent was 2. Let's say x^2 + (13x -1)^2 =0. Then expanding, x^2 + 169x^2 -26x +1=0, so 170x^2 -26x +1=0.

But the 10th roots of -1 are the same as the 20th roots of unity that are odd multiples of \(\pi/10\). Wait, maybe it's easier to write -1 as e^{i\pi + 2k\pi i}, so the 10th roots would be e^{i(\pi + 2k\pi)/10} for k=0 to 9. So each \(\omega_k = e^{i(\pi/10 + 2k\pi/10)} = e^{i\pi(1 + 2k)/10}\).

Therefore, for each k from 0 to 9, we have the equation \(x = \omega_k (13x -1)\). Let's solve for x in each case.

Starting with the equation:

\(x = \omega_k (13x - 1)\)

Expanding:

\(x = 13 \omega_k x - \omega_k\)

Bring terms with x to the left:

\(x - 13 \omega_k x = -\omega_k\)

Factor x:

\(x (1 - 13 \omega_k) = -\omega_k\)

Therefore:

\(x = \frac{-\omega_k}{1 - 13 \omega_k}\)

So each root of the original equation is given by this expression for some \(\omega_k\), which is a 10th root of -1.

Then the roots are r1, conjugate(r1), r2, conjugate(r2). Then according to the formula above, the sum would be (2a4)/(a0), where a4 is the coefficient of x^2, which is 170, and a0 is 1. So sum is 2*170 /1=340. But the actual sum is 1/(r1 conjugate(r1)) +1/(r2 conjugate(r2)) = 1/|r1|^2 +1/|r2|^2. Let's compute this. The quadratic equation is 170x^2 -26x +1=0. The roots are [26 ± sqrt(676 - 680)]/(2*170) = [26 ± sqrt(-4)]/340 = [26 ± 2i]/340 = [13 ± i]/170. Therefore, |r1|^2 = (13^2 +1^2)/170^2 = (169 +1)/28900 =170/28900=1/170. Therefore, 1/|r1|^2 =170. Similarly for r2. So the sum is 170 +170=340. Which matches the formula. So in this case, the formula works. So the formula is 2a4/a0 for quadratics. So in the original problem, if the formula holds, then the sum would be 2a10 /a0, where a10 is the coefficient of x^10, which is 1, and a0 is the constant term. But in the quadratic case, the formula was 2a2/a0, but in that case, the leading term was a2 x^2, and the constant term was a0. Wait, in the quadratic case, the equation is a2 x^2 + a1 x +a0=0. The sum of reciprocals of roots is (r1 + r2)/(r1 r2) = (-a1/a0)/(a0/a0) = -a1/a0. Wait, but in the quadratic case above, the sum of reciprocals was 2*(170)/1=340, but actually, the sum of reciprocals of roots is (1/r1 +1/r2)= (r1 + r2)/(r1 r2). From the quadratic equation, r1 + r2=26/170, and r1 r2=1/170. So (26/170)/(1/170)=26. But that's not 340. Wait, this is conflicting.

Wait, so in the quadratic case, the sum of reciprocals of roots is (1/r1 +1/r2)= (r1 + r2)/(r1 r2)= (26/170)/(1/170)=26. But according to the previous calculation, when I computed |r1|^2, it was 1/170, so 1/|r1|^2=170. Then the sum of 1/|r1|^2 +1/|r2|^2=170 +170=340. Which is different. So there is a discrepancy here. Therefore, my initial formula is wrong. So in the quadratic case, the sum of reciprocals of |ri|^2 is 340, but the sum of reciprocals of ri is 26. Therefore, my previous assumption that the sum of reciprocals of |ri|^2 is 2a10 /a0 is incorrect. Therefore, I need to think again.

Based on execution_1.1:
Wait, but in the quadratic case, the sum of reciprocals of |ri|^2 was 340, which is 2*170, which is 2 times the coefficient of x^2. Wait, but in that case, the sum was 2*(a2)/a0. But here, a2 is 170, and a0 is 1. Wait, no, in the quadratic case, the sum was 2*(170)/1=340, but in reality, the sum of reciprocals of |ri|^2 was 340. So maybe in general, for a polynomial of degree 2n with roots coming in conjugate pairs, the sum of reciprocals of |ri|^2 is 2 times the coefficient of x^n divided by the constant term? Wait, not sure.

Wait, let's step back. Let's think about the original equation \(x^{10} + (13x -1)^{10} = 0\). Let me make a substitution to simplify it.

<prompt_2.1> Substitute variables to simplify the equation and find a relationship between x and y. </prompt_2.1>

Based on execution_1.2:
Wait, so in the quadratic case, the formula would be sum of 1/|ri|^2=2*(a2)/a0. But in the quadratic equation, 170x^2 -26x +1=0, then 2*(170)/1=340, which matches. But in the original problem, the equation is degree 10, so perhaps the sum is 2*(coefficient of x^10)/(coefficient of x^0). Wait, but in the quadratic case, the coefficient of x^10 would be equivalent to a2, and the coefficient of x^0 is a0. So perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of x^10 is 1, and the constant term is (-1)^10 /13^10? Wait, let's check.

<prompt_2.2> Calculate the sum of reciprocals of squared moduli for the original equation using the pattern identified. </prompt_2.2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Let me set \(y = 13x - 1\). Then, the equation becomes \(x^{10} + y^{10} = 0\), with the condition that \(y = 13x - 1\). So substituting y into the first equation, we have \(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\), which is the original equation.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Let me expand \((13x -1)^{10}\). The constant term is \((-1)^{10} =1\). So the original equation is \(x^{10} + (13x -1)^{10} =0\). Therefore, the constant term is 0^{10} + 1 =1. The leading term is x^{10} + (13x)^{10} =x^{10} +13^{10}x^{10}, so the coefficient of x^{10} is 1 +13^{10}. Therefore, the polynomial is of the form (1 +13^{10})x^{10} + ... +1=0. Therefore, if we follow the pattern from the quadratic case, the sum of reciprocals of |ri|^2 would be 2*(coefficient of x^10)/constant term. But in the quadratic case, coefficient of x^2 was 170, and constant term 1, and the sum was 2*170/1=340. But in the original problem, coefficient of x^10 is (1 +13^{10}), and the constant term is 1. Therefore, following that pattern, the sum would be 2*(1 +13^{10}) /1=2*(1 +13^{10}).

But that seems too large. Wait, but in the quadratic case, the equation was 170x^2 -26x +1=0, so the coefficient of x^2 is 170, and the constant term is 1. Then the sum of reciprocals of |ri|^2 is 2*170=340, which is correct as we saw. So in the original problem, if the polynomial is (1 +13^{10})x^{10} + ... +1=0, then the sum would be 2*(1 +13^{10})/1=2*(1 +13^{10}).

But that seems huge. Let me check with another example. Suppose we have a quartic equation x^4 + (x -1)^4=0. Let's compute the sum of reciprocals of |ri|^2. Let's expand (x -1)^4: x^4 -4x^3 +6x^2 -4x +1. Then the equation is x^4 +x^4 -4x^3 +6x^2 -4x +1=0 => 2x^4 -4x^3 +6x^2 -4x +1=0. Then according to the pattern, the sum should be 2*(2)/1=4. Let's check if that's true. Let's compute the roots. But maybe it's easier to compute |r_i|^2.

Alternatively, suppose we take the equation x^4 + (x -1)^4=0. Let me solve it. Let me set x = re^{iθ}. Then the equation becomes r^4 e^{i4θ} + (re^{iθ} -1)^4=0. Hmm, this might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe use substitution. Let me set y = x -1/2 to center the equation, but perhaps not helpful. Alternatively, note that x^4 + (x -1)^4=0 can be written as x^4 = - (x -1)^4. Taking 4th roots, x = ω (x -1), where ω^4 = -1. So ω = e^{iπ/4 + i k π/2} for k=0,1,2,3. So four roots. For each ω, solve x = ω(x -1). Then x = ω x - ω => x - ω x = -ω => x(1 - ω) = -ω => x = -ω / (1 - ω). Let's compute this for each ω.

First, ω = e^{iπ/4} = (sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2). Then x = -ω / (1 - ω). Let's compute denominator 1 - ω = 1 - sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2. The modulus squared is (1 - sqrt(2)/2)^2 + (sqrt(2)/2)^2. Let's compute:

(1 - sqrt(2)/2)^2 = 1 - sqrt(2) + (sqrt(2)/2)^2 =1 - sqrt(2) + (2/4)=1 - sqrt(2) + 1/2= 3/2 - sqrt(2).

(sqrt(2)/2)^2= 0.5.

Therefore, modulus squared is 3/2 - sqrt(2) + 0.5= 2 - sqrt(2). Therefore, modulus is sqrt(2 - sqrt(2)).

Then |x|^2 = | -ω / (1 - ω) |^2 = |ω|^2 / |1 - ω|^2 =1 / (2 - sqrt(2)).

Therefore, 1/|x|^2 = (2 - sqrt(2))/1=2 - sqrt(2). Similarly, for each root, since the equation is symmetric, all four roots will have the same modulus? Wait, no. Wait, each ω is different. Let's check another ω.

Second, ω = e^{i3π/4} = (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2). Then x = -ω / (1 - ω). Let's compute 1 - ω =1 + sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2. The modulus squared is (1 + sqrt(2)/2)^2 + (sqrt(2)/2)^2. Compute:

(1 + sqrt(2)/2)^2 =1 + sqrt(2) + (sqrt(2)/2)^2=1 + sqrt(2) +0.5=1.5 + sqrt(2).

(sqrt(2)/2)^2=0.5. So total modulus squared is 1.5 + sqrt(2) +0.5=2 + sqrt(2). Therefore, |x|^2=1 / (2 + sqrt(2)).

Therefore, 1/|x|^2=2 + sqrt(2). Wait, so for different ω, we get different 1/|x|^2. Therefore, in this quartic case, the sum would be two terms: 2 - sqrt(2) and 2 + sqrt(2), each appearing twice (since there are two pairs of complex conjugates). Therefore, the total sum is 2*(2 - sqrt(2)) + 2*(2 + sqrt(2))=4 - 2sqrt(2) +4 +2sqrt(2)=8. Which is 2*(2)=4? Wait, no, according to the previous pattern, the sum should be 2*(coefficient of x^4)/constant term. The coefficient of x^4 is 2, constant term is1, so 2*2/1=4. But our manual calculation gives 8. Therefore, the pattern is invalid.

Hmm, so my initial assumption about the sum being 2a10/a0 is incorrect. Therefore, I need another approach.

Wait, but in the quadratic case, the sum was 2*(coefficient of x^2)/constant term, but in the quartic case, that formula gives 4, but actual sum is 8. So discrepancy. Therefore, the formula is not general. Therefore, need another way.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum is 2*(coefficient of x^10)/(coefficient of x^0). But in the quadratic case, coefficient of x^2 is 170, coefficient of x^0 is1, so 2*170=340, which was correct. In the quartic case, coefficient of x^4 is 2, coefficient of x^0 is1, so 2*2=4, but actual sum is 8. Therefore, discrepancy. Therefore, this approach is invalid.

So need another way.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum of reciprocals of |ri|^2 is equal to (sum of reciprocals of |ri|^2) = (sum of reciprocals of roots of the polynomial in the complex plane). But since roots come in conjugate pairs, each pair contributes 2 Re(1/ri^2). Wait, no, 1/ri^2 is the reciprocal of the square of the modulus. Wait, no, 1/ri \overline{ri} is 1/|ri|^2. So each term is 1/|ri|^2.

But how does this relate to the polynomial? Let me consider that if the roots are r1, \overline{r1}, r2, \overline{r2}, etc. , then the polynomial can be written as the product over (x - ri)(x - \overline{ri}) = (x^2 - 2 Re(ri) x + |ri|^2). Therefore, the polynomial is a product of quadratic factors. Therefore, if we can factor the given polynomial into quadratics, then the coefficients can be related to the sum of 1/|ri|^2.

But how?

Alternatively, consider that if we have a polynomial P(x) with roots ri, then the sum over 1/|ri|^2 is equal to sum over (1/ri \overline{ri}) = sum over ( \overline{ri} / |ri|^2 ). Wait, but since coefficients of the polynomial are real, the sum over 1/ri would be the sum of the reciprocals of the roots, which is - coefficient of x^9 / coefficient of x^10. But 1/ri is not the same as 1/|ri|^2. However, perhaps there is a relation.

Alternatively, note that 1/|ri|^2 = (1/ri) \overline{ri}. But since the polynomial has real coefficients, the roots come in conjugate pairs. Therefore, if ri is a root, so is \overline{ri}. Therefore, the product (x - ri)(x - \overline{ri}) = x^2 - 2 Re(ri) x + |ri|^2. Therefore, if we can factor the original polynomial into such quadratics, then the constant term of each quadratic is |ri|^2, and the coefficient of x is -2 Re(ri). Therefore, if we take the product of all such quadratics, the constant term of the entire polynomial is the product of all |ri|^2. Similarly, the coefficient of x^10 is the product of the leading coefficients of each quadratic, which is 1 for each, so 1. But how does that help us?

Wait, we need the sum of 1/|ri|^2. If we have the product of |ri|^2 as the constant term, but how to get the sum? The sum of reciprocals of |ri|^2 is equal to (sum over 1/|ri|^2) = (sum over \overline{ri} / (ri \overline{ri})) = (sum over \overline{ri}) / (product over |ri|^2). Wait, but sum over \overline{ri} is the sum over the conjugates of the roots. But since the polynomial has real coefficients, the sum over the roots is equal to - coefficient of x^9 / coefficient of x^10. Let me check.

Based on execution_2.2:
Let me verify this with the quadratic example. The quadratic equation was 170x^2 -26x +1=0. Then sum of reciprocals of |ri|^2 is 340. According to the formula, it should be (sum of reciprocals of roots) * (product of roots). Wait, the product of roots is 1/170, as per Vieta's formula (constant term / leading coefficient). The sum of reciprocals of roots is (r1 + r2)/(r1 r2) = (-b/a)/(c/a) = -b/c. Wait, in quadratic ax^2 +bx +c=0, sum of roots is -b/a, product is c/a. Therefore, sum of reciprocals is (-b/a)/(c/a)= -b/c. Therefore, sum of reciprocals of |ri|^2 is (sum of reciprocals of roots) / (product of roots). Wait, no, sum of reciprocals of |ri|^2 is sum(1/(ri \overline{ri}))= sum( \overline{ri} / |ri|^2 ). But since |ri|^2 is real, and \overline{ri} is the other root in the conjugate pair. Wait, perhaps this is getting too tangled. Let's go back.

Based on execution_2.2, execution_2.3:
Therefore, in the original problem, coefficient of x^10 is 1 +13^{10}, coefficient of x^9 is ... Wait, let's check the original equation: \(x^{10} + (13x -1)^{10} =0\). To expand this, let's consider the expansion of (13x -1)^10 using the binomial theorem.

(13x -1)^10 = \sum_{k=0}^{10} \binom{10}{k} (13x)^{10 -k} (-1)^k

= \sum_{k=0}^{10} (-1)^k \binom{10}{k} 13^{10 -k} x^{10 -k}

Therefore, when we add x^10 to this, the equation becomes:

x^10 + \sum_{k=0}^{10} (-1)^k \binom{10}{k} 13^{10 -k} x^{10 -k} =0

= \sum_{k=0}^{10} (-1)^k \binom{10}{k} 13^{10 -k} x^{10 -k} + x^10 =0

But x^10 is the same as the term when k=10: (-1)^10 \binom{10}{10} 13^0 x^0 x^{10} =1 *1*1*x^{10}=x^{10}. Therefore, combining terms, the equation is:

\sum_{k=0}^{10} (-1)^k \binom{10}{k} 13^{10 -k} x^{10 -k} + x^10 =0

But when k=10, the term is x^10, so adding another x^10 would make it 2x^10. Wait, no. Wait, original equation is x^10 + (13x -1)^10=0. So expanding (13x -1)^10 gives a polynomial where the highest term is (13x)^10, and the constant term is (-1)^10=1. Then adding x^10 to this gives x^10 + (13x -1)^10 = x^10 + [sum_{k=0}^{10} ... ] =0. Therefore, the x^10 term is x^10 + (13x)^10, which is x^10 +13^{10}x^{10}. Therefore, the coefficient of x^10 is 1 +13^{10}. The coefficient of x^9 comes from two sources: the x^9 term in (13x -1)^10 and the x^9 term from the original x^10 term, but since x^10 term only has x^10 and constants, there is no x^9 term there. Therefore, the coefficient of x^9 is only from (13x -1)^10. Let's compute that.

In the expansion of (13x -1)^10, the coefficient of x^9 is when k=1 in the binomial expansion:

For (13x -1)^10, general term is \binom{10}{k} (13x)^{10 -k} (-1)^k.

To get x^9, we need 10 -k=9 =>k=1. Therefore, the coefficient is \binom{10}{1} (13)^9 (-1)^1 =10 *13^9*(-1)= -10*13^9.

Therefore, the coefficient of x^9 in the entire equation x^10 + (13x -1)^10 is -10*13^9.

Similarly, the coefficient of x^8 would come from k=2 in the binomial expansion:

\binom{10}{2} (13x)^8 (-1)^2 =45 *13^8 *1=45*13^8. So coefficient of x^8 is +45*13^8.

Continuing this way, but perhaps the key coefficients are x^10, x^9, x^1, x^0.

But going back, the formula we derived earlier was:

Sum of reciprocals of |ri|^2 = (sum of reciprocals of roots) * (product of roots).

But sum of reciprocals of roots is - coefficient of x^9 / coefficient of x^10. From Vieta's formula for a polynomial P(x) = a_{10}x^{10} + ... +a_0, the sum of reciprocals of roots is -a_9/a_{10}. Therefore, sum of reciprocals of roots is -(-10*13^9)/(1 +13^{10}) =10*13^9/(1 +13^{10}).

The product of the roots is a_0/a_{10} =1/(1 +13^{10}).

Therefore, the sum of reciprocals of |ri|^2 is [10*13^9/(1 +13^{10})] / [1/(1 +13^{10})] =10*13^9. Wait, that's a possibility. Let's check:

sum(1/|ri|^2) = [sum(1/ri)] / [product(ri)].

But sum(1/ri) = -a_9/a_{10} = -(-10*13^9)/(1 +13^{10}) =10*13^9/(1 +13^{10}).

Product(ri) = a_0/a_{10} =1/(1 +13^{10}).

Therefore, dividing these gives [10*13^9/(1 +13^{10})] / [1/(1 +13^{10})] =10*13^9. Therefore, the sum is 10*13^9.

But wait, in the quadratic example, this formula would give sum of reciprocals of |ri|^2 as (sum of reciprocals of roots) * (product of roots). Let's check:

In quadratic example, sum of reciprocals of roots was (r1 + r2)/(r1 r2)= -b/a / (c/a)= -b/c=26/1=26. Product of roots was1/170. Therefore, 26 / (1/170)=26*170=4420. But in reality, the sum was 340. Therefore, discrepancy. Therefore, the formula is not correct. Therefore, my previous conclusion is wrong.

Therefore, my mistake. Therefore, need to re-examine.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Let me think again. If the polynomial is P(x) = \prod_{i=1}^{10} (x - ri), then sum_{i=1}^{10} 1/ri = -a_9/a_{10}. And product_{i=1}^{10} ri = (-1)^{10} a_0/a_{10}=a_0/a_{10}. Therefore, sum_{i=1}^{10} 1/ri = -a_9/a_{10}, product ri =a_0/a_{10}. Therefore, sum_{i=1}^{10} 1/(ri \overline{ri})= sum_{i=1}^{10} 1/|ri|^2. But how to relate this to the coefficients.

Wait, perhaps not directly. Because 1/|ri|^2 is not the same as 1/ri^2, unless ri are real, which they are not. Therefore, perhaps another approach.

Alternatively, note that if ri is a root, then 1/|ri|^2 = 1/(ri \overline{ri}) = \overline{ri}/|ri|^2. But since the polynomial has real coefficients, the roots come in conjugate pairs. Therefore, if ri is a root, so is \overline{ri}. Therefore, 1/|ri|^2 =1/(ri \overline{ri})=1/(ri) * 1/\overline{ri}. But since \overline{ri} is another root, say rj. Therefore, 1/|ri|^2 = \overline{ri}/|ri|^2. But this seems circular.

Alternatively, consider that if we take the reciprocal of the roots, 1/ri, then the polynomial whose roots are 1/ri is obtained by reversing the coefficients. That is, if P(x)=a_{10}x^{10}+... +a_0, then the polynomial with roots 1/ri is Q(x)=x^{10}P(1/x)=a_0 x^{10} + ... +a_{10}. Therefore, the sum of reciprocals of roots of P(x) is sum_{i=1}^{10} 1/ri = -a_9/a_{10}, as before. But how does this relate to sum of 1/|ri|^2?

Alternatively, perhaps consider that 1/|ri|^2 = (1/ri) * \overline{(1/ri)}. If we let
