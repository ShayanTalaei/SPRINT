Okay, let's see. The problem is asking how many integers are in the solution set of |x - 2| ≤ 5.6. Hmm, absolute value inequalities can sometimes be tricky, but I think I remember that the absolute value |A| ≤ B means that A is between -B and B. So maybe I can rewrite this inequality in a different form.
Let me start by recalling the general rule for absolute value inequalities. If |A| ≤ B, where B is a positive number, then this is equivalent to -B ≤ A ≤ B. So applying that to this problem, |x - 2| ≤ 5.6 should translate to -5.6 ≤ x - 2 ≤ 5.6.

Now, to solve for x, I need to isolate x in the middle. That means I should add 2 to all three parts of the inequality.
Let's do that step by step.

Starting with the left part: -5.6 ≤ x - 2. If I add 2 to both sides, that becomes -5.6 + 2 ≤ x. Similarly, the right part: x - 2 ≤ 5.6. Adding 2 to both sides gives x ≤ 5.6 + 2. So combining these two, the solution set is -5.6 + 2 ≤ x ≤ 5.6 + 2.

Let me compute those numbers.
-5.6 + 2 is the same as 2 - 5.6, which is -3.6. And 5.6 + 2 is 7.6. So the inequality simplifies to -3.6 ≤ x ≤ 7.6.

Wait, let me check that again.
If I take the original |x - 2| ≤ 5.6, then the distance between x and 2 is at most 5.6. So x can be as low as 2 - 5.6, which is -3.6, and as high as 2 + 5.6, which is 7.6. Yeah, that's right. So the solution interval is from -3.6 to 7.6.

Now, the question is asking how many integers are in this solution set. So I need to find all integers x such that -3.6 ≤ x ≤ 7.6. Let me list the integers in this interval.

<prompt_1.1> List the integers within the interval \(-3.6 \leq x \leq 7.6\). </prompt_1.1>

But wait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial steps. Let's re-examine the inequality.

<prompt_1.2> Re-examine the initial steps of solving the inequality to ensure correctness. </prompt_1.2>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
First, the lower bound is -3.6. Since we're dealing with integers, the smallest integer greater than or equal to -3.6 is -3 because -3.6 is between -4 and -3. So the first integer in the interval is -3.

Then, moving up, the next integers would be -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Wait, let's check the upper bound. The upper bound is 7.6, so the largest integer less than or equal to 7.6 is 7. So the integers go up to 7.

Let me list them all out to be thorough:
-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

<execution_1.2>
Starting with |x - 2| ≤ 5.6. The absolute value being less than or equal to 5.6 means that the expression inside, x - 2, is between -5.6 and 5.6. So yes, -5.6 ≤ x - 2 ≤ 5.6. Then adding 2 to all parts: -5.6 + 2 = -3.6 and 5.6 + 2 = 7.6. So x is between -3.6 and 7.6.

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Now, let's count them. Starting from -3:

<prompt_2.1> Count the integers listed in the interval \(-3.6 \leq x \leq 7.6\). </prompt_2.1>

Based on execution_1.1, execution_1.2:
Therefore, the number of integers in the solution set is 11.

<prompt_2.2> Confirm the number of integers in the solution set and ensure no mistakes were made. </prompt_2.2>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
1. -3
2. -2
3. -1
4. 0
5. 1
6. 2
7. 3
8. 4
9. 5
10. 6
11. 7

So that's 11 integers in total.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Just to confirm, let's count again:

1. -3
2. -2
3. -1
4. 0
5. 1
6. 2
7. 3
8. 4
9. 5
10. 6
11. 7

Yep, 11 integers.

Wait, let me check if I missed any. Sometimes when counting inclusive numbers, it's easy to make an off-by-one error. Let's think about it another way. The distance from -3.6 to 7.6.

The integers from -3 to 7 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers inclusive, you can use the formula: upper - lower + 1. So here, upper is 7, lower is -3. So 7 - (-3) + 1 = 7 + 3 + 1 = 11. That matches my previous count.

Alternatively, if I list them again:

Starting at -3, then each subsequent integer up to 7. Let's count:

-3 (1), -2 (2), -1 (3), 0 (4), 1 (5), 2 (6), 3 (7), 4 (8), 5 (9), 6 (10), 7 (11). Yep, 11 numbers.

So I think that's the answer. But let me just verify once more to be absolutely sure.

Another way: the length of the interval from -3.6 to 7.6 is 7.6 - (-3.6) = 11.2. But since we're dealing with integers, each integer is 1 unit apart. The number of integers in the interval is approximately the length plus 1, but since the endpoints are not integers themselves, we have to check if the endpoints are included or not.

Wait, the interval is closed, so including both endpoints. But since the endpoints are not integers, the number of integers is floor(7.6) - ceil(-3.6) + 1. Let's compute that.

ceil(-3.6) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to -3.6, which is -3. floor(7.6) is the largest integer less than or equal to 7.6, which is 7. So the number of integers is 7 - (-3) + 1 = 7 + 3 + 1 = 11. So that formula gives 11 as well.

Therefore, I can confirm that there are 11 integers in the solution set.
