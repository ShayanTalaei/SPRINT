</Question>

<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to find the remainder when 129^34 + 96^38 is divided by 11. Hmm, that sounds like a problem where I can use modular arithmetic. Let me remember how that works. When dealing with remainders, especially with exponents, modular arithmetic can simplify things by reducing the bases first.

First, I should find the remainders of 129 and 96 when divided by 11. That way, I can replace them with smaller numbers, which might be easier to work with. Let me start with 129.

Now for 96. Let's divide 96 by 11.

Let me check with another method to be sure.

Alternatively, maybe using Fermat's little theorem. Since 11 is prime, for any integer a not divisible by 11, a^10 ≡ 1 mod 11. So, we can reduce the exponents modulo 10.

<execution_1.1>
11 times 11 is 121, right? So 129 minus 121 is 8. Therefore, 129 ≡ 8 mod 11. Okay, so 129^34 mod 11 is the same as 8^34 mod 11.

<execution_1.2>
11*8 = 88. 96 - 88 = 8. So 96 divided by 11 is 8 with a remainder of 8. So 96 ≡ 8 mod 11.
</execution_1.2>

<execution_1.3>
Let's try that.

For 129^34 mod11. Since 129 ≡ 9 mod11. So 9^34. Since 9^10 ≡1 mod11, then 9^34 = 9^(10*3 +4) = (9^10)^3 *9^4 ≡1^3 *9^4 ≡9^4. Then compute 9^4: 9^2=81≡4 mod11, then 4^2=16≡5 mod11. So 9^4≡5 mod11. Same result.

Similarly for 6^38. 38 divided by10 is 3 with remainder 8. So 6^38=6^(10*3 +8)= (6^10)^3 *6^8 ≡1^3 *6^8. Compute 6^8. 6^2=36≡3 mod11, 6^4=(6^2)^2≡3^2=9 mod11, 6^8=(6^4)^2≡9^2=81≡4 mod11. So same result. So sum is 5+4=9 mod11. So both methods agree. Therefore, the remainder is 9.

Based on execution_1.1, execution_1.2:
So now the problem simplifies to finding (8^34 + 8^38) mod 11. Hmm, both terms have 8 raised to a power. Maybe I can factor out the smaller power. Let's see, 8^34 is common in both terms. So 8^34*(1 + 8^4) mod 11. That might be easier because 8^4 can be computed once and then added to 1.

But first, let me confirm if this approach is correct. Since 8^38 is 8^(34+4) = 8^34 * 8^4. Yes, so factoring out 8^34 gives 8^34*(1 + 8^4).
So that's correct. Now, let's compute 8^34 mod 11 and 8^4 mod 11 separately.

None

<prompt_2.1> Execute the above plan to compute 8^4 mod 11 and simplify the expression. </prompt_2.1>

Based on execution_1.3:
Wait, just to be thorough, let me check once more. Maybe compute 8^34 mod11 directly using Fermat. 8^10 ≡1 mod11.

<prompt_2.2> Re-verify the solution using Fermat's Little Theorem and confirm the remainder. </prompt_2.2>

<execution_2.1>
Starting with 8^1 mod 11 is 8. 8^2 is 64, which divided by 11 is 5*11=55, 64-55=9. So 8^2 ≡ 9 mod 11. Then 8^4 is (8^2)^2, which is 9^2 = 81. 81 divided by 11 is 7*11=77, remainder 4. So 8^4 ≡ 4 mod 11. Therefore, 1 + 8^4 ≡ 1 + 4 = 5 mod 11. So now the expression becomes 8^34 * 5 mod 11.

So now I need to compute 8^34 mod 11. Again, since 8 and 11 are coprime, Fermat's little theorem tells us that 8^10 ≡ 1 mod 11. So 8^10 ≡ 1, so 8^30 = (8^10)^3 ≡ 1^3 = 1 mod 11. Then 8^34 = 8^30 * 8^4 ≡ 1 * 8^4 ≡ 8^4 mod 11. We already calculated 8^4 ≡ 4 mod 11. So 8^34 ≡ 4 mod 11. Therefore, 8^34 * 5 ≡ 4 * 5 = 20 mod 11. 20 divided by 11 is 1*11=11, remainder 9. So 20 ≡ 9 mod 11. Therefore, the total expression is 9 mod 11.

So 34 divided by10 is 3 with remainder 4. So 8^34=8^(10*3 +4)= (8^10)^3 *8^4 ≡1^3 *8^4≡8^4. Then 8^4 as before is 5. So yes, 8^34≡5. Similarly 8^38=8^(10*3 +8)= (8^10)^3 *8^8≡1^3*(8^8). 8^8=(8^4)^2≡5^2=25≡3 mod11. Wait, wait, hold on. Wait, earlier I said 8^38=6^38, but 8 is 129 mod11, which is 9? Wait, no. Wait, 129 ≡8 mod11, 96≡8 mod11. Wait, so both bases are 8 mod11? Wait, 129 is 11*11=121, 129-121=8. 96 divided by11 is 8*11=88, 96-88=8. So both 129 and 96 are congruent to 8 mod11. So actually, both terms are 8^34 and 8^38. So when I applied Fermat's theorem, I considered 9^34 and 6^38 earlier, but that was a mistake. Wait, no. Wait, no, 129 ≡8 mod11, 96≡8 mod11. So both terms are 8^34 and 8^38. So my initial approach was correct. Then why did I switch to 9 and 6? That was a mistake. So correcting that: both terms are 8^34 and 8^38. Therefore, using Fermat's little theorem, 8^10 ≡1 mod11.

So 8^34: 34 divided by10 is 3 remainder 4, so 8^34 ≡8^4. 8^4: 8^2=64≡9 mod11, then 9^2=81≡4 mod11. So 8^34≡4 mod11. Similarly, 8^38: 38 divided by10 is 3 remainder 8, so 8^38≡8^8. 8^8=(8^4)^2≡4^2=16≡5 mod11. Therefore, 8^38≡5 mod11. Then adding them: 4 +5=9 mod11. So same result. Therefore, the remainder is 9. So previous mistake in reasoning where I incorrectly took 129 as 9 mod11 and 96 as 6 mod11, but actually both are 8 mod11. So both exponents are 8. Therefore, the correct answer is 9. So the initial calculation was correct, and then I confused myself by redoing it with incorrect bases. But the final answer remains 9. Therefore, the remainder is 9.

Wait, but let me check this again step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Based on execution_2.2:
But just to confirm, let's compute 8^34 and 8^38 modulo11 separately without using Fermat's. Maybe that can help cross-verify.

<prompt_3.2> Perform a final verification using direct computation of powers to confirm the remainder. </prompt_3.2>

First, 129 mod 11: 11*11=121, 129-121=8. Correct. 96 mod 11: 11*8=88, 96-88=8. Correct. So both are 8. Then 8^34 + 8^38 mod11. Then factoring 8^34(1 + 8^4). Then 8^2=64≡9 mod11. Then 8^4=(8^2)^2=9^2=81≡4 mod11. So 1 + 4=5. Then 8^34=8^(10*3 +4)= (8^10)^3 *8^4. Since 8^10≡1 mod11, so 1^3*4=4. Then 4*5=20≡9 mod11. So that seems correct.

<execution_3.2>
Starting with 8^1 ≡8 mod11

8^2=64≡64-5*11=64-55=9 mod11

8^3=8^2*8=9*8=72≡72-6*11=72-66=6 mod11

8^4=8^3*8=6*8=48≡48-4*11=48-44=4 mod11

8^5=8^4*8=4*8=32≡32-2*11=32-22=10 mod11

8^6=8^5*8=10*8=80≡80-7*11=80-77=3 mod11

8^7=8^6*8=3*8=24≡24-2*11=24-22=2 mod11

8^8=8^7*8=2*8=16≡16-1*11=5 mod11

8^9=8^8*8=5*8=40≡40-3*11=40-33=7 mod11

8^10=8^9*8=7*8=56≡56-5*11=56-55=1 mod11

Oh, so 8^10 ≡1 mod11, which matches Fermat's little theorem. So then:

8^34: 34 divided by10 is 3 remainder4, so 8^34≡8^4≡4 mod11.

8^38: 38 divided by10 is 3 remainder8, so 8^38≡8^8≡5 mod11.

Adding them: 4 +5=9 mod11. So same result. Therefore, the remainder is indeed 9. So I think this is correct. Therefore, the answer is 9.
