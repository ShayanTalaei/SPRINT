Okay, so I need to find the measure of angle α in this hexagon that's inscribed in a circle. Let me start by recalling some properties of cyclic polygons, which are polygons inscribed in a circle. One key thing is that the opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral sum to 180 degrees, but a hexagon is more complex. However, maybe I can break it down into quadrilaterals or triangles?

Looking at the Asymptote code, the points are labeled pA to pF, and the angles labeled are 105° at pF (which is point F), 110° at pB (point B), and α at pD (point D). The diagram shows a hexagon with these three angles given. Since it's inscribed in a circle, all the vertices lie on the circumference.

First, I should note the number of sides: 6, so a hexagon. The sum of the interior angles of a hexagon can be calculated using the formula (n-2)*180°, where n is the number of sides. For a hexagon, that's (6-2)*180° = 4*180° = 720°. So all six interior angles add up to 720 degrees.

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
However, since it's cyclic, there might be some relationships between the angles. But I don't remember exact properties for hexagons. Maybe I can divide the hexagon into triangles or quadrilaterals and use properties of those?

Alternatively, each side of the hexagon subtends an arc on the circle. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its subtended arc. So if I can find the arcs corresponding to each side, then maybe I can relate the angles to those arcs.

Let me try that approach.

<prompt_2.1> Use the properties of inscribed angles and arcs to find the measure of angle α. </prompt_2.1>
-----

Wait, but let me verify this with another approach to be sure.

Alternatively, since the hexagon is cyclic, the sum of every other angle is 180°, but I think that's for quadrilaterals. Wait, no. For cyclic polygons with an even number of sides, there might be relations, but hexagons are more complicated. Let me think.

<prompt_2.2> Verify the solution using an alternative method by dividing the hexagon into triangles. </prompt_2.2>
-----

But let me just check once more if there's another way. Maybe using the fact that the central angles sum to 360°, and each inscribed angle is half the central angle.

<prompt_2.3> Verify the solution using another alternative method by considering central angles. </prompt_2.3>

<execution_2.1>
First, let's denote the arcs between each pair of consecutive points. Let's label the points in order: A, B, C, D, E, F, and back to A. Each side of the hexagon corresponds to an arc between two points. Let's call the arc from A to B as arc AB, and so on.

Since the hexagon is inscribed in the circle, the measure of each interior angle is equal to half the sum of the measures of the arcs intercepted by the two sides forming the angle and their opposites? Wait, no, maybe I need to recall the exact formula. For an inscribed angle, the measure is half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs. Wait, actually, an inscribed angle intercepts two arcs: the arc opposite to the angle and the arc that's opposite? Hmm, maybe I need to clarify.

Wait, no. Let me think. When you have an inscribed angle, like angle at point B, which is angle ABC. The angle at point B is formed by chords BA and BC. The measure of angle ABC is half the measure of the arc that's opposite to angle B, which would be arc AC. Wait, yes, that's right. The inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. But in a polygon, each interior angle is formed by two adjacent sides, so the intercepted arc would be the arc opposite to the angle. Wait, maybe not. Let me get this straight.

Suppose we have a cyclic polygon. Each interior angle is formed by two adjacent sides. For a triangle, the angle is half the measure of the arc opposite. For a quadrilateral, each angle is half the measure of the arc opposite. So, in general, in a cyclic polygon with n sides, each interior angle is equal to half the measure of the arc opposite to that angle. Therefore, if we can find the measures of all the opposite arcs, we can relate them to the angles.

But in a hexagon, each angle would be half the measure of the arc opposite to it. Therefore, if I can find the arcs opposite to each angle, then the sum of all those arcs would be 360°, since they make up the entire circle. But how does that help?
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Another approach: in a cyclic hexagon, the sum of the measures of the angles is 720°, as we already established. If we can express the other angles in terms of α and the given angles, maybe we can solve for α.

But we need more information. The problem gives three angles: 105° at F, 110° at B, and α at D. The other three angles at points A, C, and E are not given. Hmm. So unless there's some symmetry or additional properties, we might need another way.

Wait, but maybe the arcs between the given angles can help. Let me try to visualize the hexagon with points A, B, C, D, E, F in order. The angles at B, D, and F are given. Let me note that in a cyclic hexagon, the measure of an angle is equal to half the sum of the measures of the arcs intercepted by the angle and its vertical angle. Wait, no, that might be for quadrilaterals. Let me recall.

For a cyclic quadrilateral, the opposite angles sum to half the total circumference, which is 180°, but for a hexagon, each angle is formed by two adjacent sides. Each angle in the hexagon intercepts an arc opposite to it. Wait, perhaps. Let me clarify.
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
So if I denote the central angles corresponding to each side as arcs between the points. Let me label the arcs between the points as follows:

arc AB: let's say subtends central angle α1, which corresponds to inscribed angle at F (angle F = 105°), so α1 = 2*105° = 210°. Wait, but central angles can't be more than 180° in a circle, can they? Wait, no, actually, a central angle can be more than 180°, but in a cyclic polygon, consecutive arcs should add up to less than 360°. Wait, but if an inscribed angle is 105°, that would imply the central angle is 210°, which is possible, but maybe the arc is the other way around? Because in a circle, the angle subtended by an arc can be measured in two ways, the minor arc and the major arc. The inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it intercepts. So if the angle is 105°, the intercepted arc is 210°, which would be the major arc. But in a polygon, consecutive vertices are connected by arcs that are less than 180°, right? Because otherwise, the polygon would intersect itself.

Wait, but in a regular hexagon, each central angle is 60°, but this hexagon isn't regular. Hmm. So maybe some arcs are greater than 180°, but in a convex polygon inscribed in a circle, all the arcs between consecutive vertices should be less than 180°, because otherwise, the polygon would be concave or intersecting.

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Wait, no. Let me correct that. For a cyclic polygon, each interior angle is equal to half the sum of the measures of the arcs intercepted by the two sides forming the angle. Wait, that might be.

Wait, let's take angle B. Angle B is formed by sides AB and BC. The intercepted arcs would be the arcs opposite to angle B? Wait, no. Let me think again.

In a circle, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. If angle B is an inscribed angle, then the arc it intercepts is the arc from A to C, passing through the opposite side of the circle. So, angle B = 1/2 * measure of arc AC.

<prompt_3.1> Determine the measure of angle α using the properties of inscribed angles and intercepted arcs. </prompt_3.1>
-----

Based on execution_2.2:
So maybe angle at B intercepts arc D to F? Wait, no, maybe I need to draw this out.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that each angle in the cyclic hexagon intercepts the arc that is opposite to the angle. So, angle at B intercepts arc D to F? Wait, no. Let me try with a simpler case.

<prompt_3.2> Use the properties of cyclic polygons to find the measure of angle α. </prompt_3.2>
-----

Based on execution_2.3:
Wait, but in this problem, the angle at F is 105°, which is pretty large. If that angle intercepts an arc opposite to it, which would be arc BD or something?

<prompt_3.3> Calculate and verify the central angles for the given problem. </prompt_3.3>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
Therefore, if angle B is 110°, then arc AC must be 220°. But arc AC is the arc from A to C passing through the side not containing B. Wait, but in a circle, between A and C, there are two arcs: the minor arc AC and the major arc AC. The inscribed angle would intercept the arc that is opposite to the angle. So if angle B is at point B, then the intercepted arc is the arc from A to C that does not include B. Therefore, if the hexagon is labeled in order A, B, C, D, E, F, then the arc AC that doesn't pass through B would be the major arc if the hexagon is convex.

But this is getting confusing. Let me try to formalize it.

In a cyclic polygon, each interior angle is equal to half the measure of the arc opposite to that angle. So, for a cyclic hexagon, angle at vertex B is equal to half the measure of arc D to F to E to A or something? Wait, maybe not. Let's take a step back.

Let me recall that in a cyclic quadrilateral, the opposite angles sum to 180°, which is equivalent to saying that the sum of the measures of the arcs intercepted by opposite angles is 360°, since each angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. Therefore, for a quadrilateral, angle A + angle C = 180°, which implies arc BCD + arc BAD = 360°, but maybe this is not the right way.

Alternatively, in a cyclic quadrilateral, angle A intercepts arc C to D, and angle C intercepts arc A to B. Wait, perhaps the sum of angle A and angle C is half the sum of arcs C to D and A to B. If the quadrilateral is ABCD, then angle A is half arc BCD, and angle C is half arc BAD. Then angle A + angle C = (arc BCD + arc BAD)/2 = (arc BCD + arc BAD)/2. But arc BCD + arc BAD = arc BC + arc CD + arc BA + arc AD. Wait, this seems messy.

Maybe a better approach is to consider that in a cyclic polygon, the measure of an interior angle is equal to half the sum of the measures of the arcs intercepted by the two sides forming the angle and their vertical angles? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let's go back to the basics. For any triangle inscribed in a circle, the angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc. For a quadrilateral, each angle intercepts the arc opposite to it. So in a cyclic quadrilateral ABCD, angle A intercepts arc C to D, angle B intercepts arc D to A, angle C intercepts arc A to B, and angle D intercepts arc B to C. Then, angle A + angle C = (arc CD + arc AB)/2. But since arc CD + arc AB = 360° - (arc BC + arc DA). Wait, maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, in a cyclic quadrilateral, angle A + angle C = 180°, which implies that arc CD + arc AB = 360°, but that can't be because arcs CD and AB are parts of the circle. Wait, no, if angle A is 1/2 arc BC, and angle C is 1/2 arc AD, then angle A + angle C = 1/2 (arc BC + arc AD). If angle A + angle C = 180°, then arc BC + arc AD = 360°, which is the whole circle. That makes sense because in a cyclic quadrilateral, the sum of opposite angles is 180°, meaning their intercepted arcs sum to the whole circle.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
In a cyclic quadrilateral, angle A intercepts arc C to D. Wait, maybe in a hexagon, angle B intercepts the arc from D to F? Hmm, this is confusing.

Alternatively, let's look at the Asymptote code. The points are labeled in order: pA, pB, pC, pD, pE, pF. The angles are labeled at pF (105°), pB (110°), and pD (α). The diagram is drawn as pA--pB--pC--pD--pE--pF--pA. So, the hexagon is A-B-C-D-E-F-A.

In a cyclic hexagon, each interior angle is equal to half the measure of the arc opposite to that angle. So, angle at B (110°) intercepts arc D to F. Similarly, angle at F (105°) intercepts arc B to D. Angle at D (α) intercepts arc B to F. Wait, maybe. Let me check.

Wait, angle at a vertex is formed by two adjacent sides. For angle at B, the two sides are BA and BC. The angle at B is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc from A to C. Therefore, angle B = 1/2 * arc AC. Similarly, angle at F is formed by sides EF and FA, so it intercepts arc from E to A. Therefore, angle F = 1/2 * arc EA. Angle at D is formed by sides CD and CE? Wait, no, sides CD and DE. Wait, no, points D is connected to C and E. So sides DC and DE. Therefore, angle at D intercepts arc from C to E. Therefore, angle D = 1/2 * arc CE.

Wait, maybe. Let's confirm.

If angle at vertex B is formed by chords BA and BC, then the inscribed angle at B intercepts arc AC. Therefore, measure of angle B = 1/2 * measure of arc AC. Similarly, angle at F is formed by chords FE and FB, intercepting arc from E to A, so angle F = 1/2 * arc EA. Angle at D is formed by chords DC and DE, intercepting arc CE, so angle D = 1/2 * arc CE.

Therefore, if we can express arcs AC, EA, and CE in terms of other arcs, maybe we can find relationships.
</execution_3.2>

<execution_3.3>
Wait, maybe. Let's get back to the first approach.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for cyclic hexagons. I recall that for a cyclic polygon, the sum of every other angle is equal to 180°, but that's for quadrilaterals. For hexagons, maybe the sum of angles 1, 3, 5 equals the sum of angles 2, 4, 6? Wait, that might not necessarily be true. Let me check.

Wait, in a cyclic hexagon, there is a relation known as the cyclic hexagon angle sum theorem, which states that the sum of every other angle is equal. So, for a cyclic hexagon, angles 1 + 3 + 5 = angles 2 + 4 + 6. Let me verify if that's the case.

If that's true, then in our problem, we have angles at B (110°), D (α), and F (105°). If angles 2, 4, 6 sum to 110 + α + 105, and angles 1, 3, 5 would be the other three angles. But since we don't know the other three angles, this might not help directly. However, if we can find another relation.

Alternatively, maybe the sum of all angles is 720°, so if we can express the other angles in terms of α, but we only have three angles given.

Based on execution_3.1:
Given that, perhaps we can denote the arcs as follows:

Let me denote the arcs between consecutive points:

arc AB = x

arc BC = y

arc CD = z

arc DE = w

arc EF = v

arc FA = u

Then, the sum of all arcs is 360°, so x + y + z + w + v + u = 360°.

Now, angle at B is 110°, which is equal to half the measure of arc AC.

<prompt_4.1> Calculate the measure of angle α using the sum of arcs and given angles. </prompt_4.1>
-----

Based on execution_3.2:
But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the arcs can be labeled as follows:

Let’s denote arc AB = a, arc BC = b, arc CD = c, arc DE = d, arc EF = e, arc FA = f. Then, a + b + c + d + e + f = 360°.

<prompt_4.2> Verify the solution using an alternative method by labeling arcs and solving equations. </prompt_4.2>
-----

Based on execution_3.3:
Wait, perhaps not. Let me see. If the hexagon is labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, then the angles at A, B, C, D, E, F are angles 1 through 6. Then, the theorem would state that angles 1 + 3 + 5 = angles 2 + 4 + 6. But in our problem, we have angles at B (2), D (4), and F (6). So angles 2 + 4 + 6 = 110 + α + 105. If the sum of angles 1 + 3 + 5 is equal to that, but we don't know angles 1, 3, 5.

<prompt_4.3> Finalize the solution and confirm the measure of angle α. </prompt_4.3>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
But arc AC is the sum of arcs AB and BC, which is x + y. Therefore, angle B = 1/2 (x + y) = 110°, so x + y = 220°.

Similarly, angle at F is 105°, which is formed by sides EF and FA, so it intercepts arc EA, which is the sum of arcs EF and FA, which is v + u. Therefore, angle F = 1/2 (v + u) = 105°, so v + u = 210°.

Angle at D is α, formed by sides CD and DE, intercepting arc CE, which is the sum of arcs CD and DE, which is z + w. Therefore, angle D = 1/2 (z + w) = α, so z + w = 2α.

Now, we also know that the sum of all arcs is 360°, so x + y + z + w + v + u = 360°. Substituting the known values:

x + y = 220°

v + u = 210°

Therefore, 220° + z + w + 210° = 360°

So z + w = 360° - 220° - 210° = 360° - 430° = -70°. Wait, that can't be. Arc lengths can't be negative. That suggests a mistake in my reasoning.
</execution_4.1>

<execution_4.2>
Then, angle at B is 1/2 * arc AC. But arc AC is equal to arc AB + arc BC = a + b. So angle B = 1/2 (a + b) = 110°, so a + b = 220°. Similarly, angle at F is 105°, which is 1/2 * arc EA. Arc EA is arc EF + arc FA = e + f. So angle F = 1/2 (e + f) = 105°, so e + f = 210°. Angle at D is α, which is 1/2 * arc CE. Arc CE is arc CD + arc DE = c + d. So angle D = 1/2 (c + d) = α, so c + d = 2α.

Now, we have three equations:

1. a + b = 220°

2. e + f = 210°

3. c + d = 2α

But we also know that the sum of all arcs is 360°, so a + b + c + d + e + f = 360°. Substituting the known values:

220° + c + d + 210° = 360°

So c + d = 360° - 220° - 210° = 360° - 430° = -70°. Wait, that can't be. Arcs can't have negative measures. That indicates a mistake in my reasoning.
</execution_4.2>

<execution_4.3>
So maybe this theorem isn't directly helpful here. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that in a cyclic polygon, the exterior angle is equal to the interior angle at the opposite vertex. Wait, no, that's in tangential polygons. Not sure about cyclic.

Alternatively, let's go back to the first approach. If angle B is 110°, which intercepts arc AC, then arc AC = 220°, as per the inscribed angle formula. Similarly, angle F is 105°, intercepting arc EA, so arc EA = 210°. Angle D is α, intercepting arc CE, so arc CE = 2α.

Then, if we can express the sum of arcs in terms of these.

But arc AC is arc AB + arc BC = x + y = 220°, as established earlier.

Arc EA is arc EF + arc FA = v + u = 210°.

Arc CE is arc CD + arc DE = z + w = 2α.

But then, we also have the remaining arc, which is arc BD? Wait, no. Wait, all arcs are AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA. So if we know some arcs:

From angle B: arc AC = x + y = 220°

From angle F: arc EA = v + u = 210°

From angle D: arc CE = z + w = 2α

But we also have the full circle: x + y + z + w + v + u = 360°

Substituting the known arcs:

220° + 2α + (remaining arcs? ) Wait, no. Wait, x + y + z + w + v + u = (x + y) + (z + w) + (v + u) = 220° + 2α + 210° = 360°

Therefore, 220 + 210 + 2α = 360

So 430 + 2α = 360

Then, 2α = 360 - 430 = -70

α = -35°

Wait, that can't be. Negative angle? That doesn't make sense. So there must be a mistake here.
</execution_4.3>
</Execution_4>

<Plan_5>
Based on execution_4.1:
Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Arcs can't have a negative measure. So I must have made a wrong assumption here. Let me check my reasoning again.

<prompt_5.1> Correct the mistake in the calculation of arc CE and recalculate the arcs. </prompt_5.1>
-----

Based on execution_4.2:
Therefore, z + w = 2α = 360° - 220° - 210° = -70°. Negative again. So that's impossible.

<prompt_5.2> Recalculate the sum of arcs and solve for α using the corrected understanding. </prompt_5.2>
-----

Based on execution_4.3:
Hmm, this suggests that there's an error in my understanding of how the angles relate to the arcs. Let me try to re-evaluate my approach.

<prompt_5.3> Analyze the negative result and verify the properties used to ensure correctness. </prompt_5.3>
</Plan_5>

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
Wait, angle D is at point D, which is connected to C and E. So the sides forming angle D are DC and DE. Therefore, angle D is formed by chords DC and DE, so it intercepts arc CE. But arc CE is the arc from C to E passing through the opposite side of the circle from D. However, in a convex polygon, arcs between consecutive points are less than 180°, so arc CE would actually be the sum of arcs CD and DE, which are consecutive arcs. Therefore, arc CE is indeed z + w, so angle D = 1/2 (z + w). That seems correct.

But then, sum of all arcs is x + y + z + w + v + u = 360°. We have x + y = 220°, v + u = 210°, so z + w = 360 - 220 - 210 = -70°. Negative. That can't be. So there must be an error in how I'm interpreting which arcs the angles intercept.
</execution_5.1>

<execution_5.2>
Wait, so where did I go wrong? Let me retrace.

If angle at B is 110°, then arc AC (which is x + y) is 220°, correct. Angle at F is 105°, so arc EA (v + u) is 210°, correct. Then angle at D is α, intercepting arc CE (z + w). Then total arcs:

arc AB (x) + arc BC (y) + arc CD (z) + arc DE (w) + arc EF (v) + arc FA (u) = 360°

But arc AC is x + y, arc CE is z + w, arc EA is v + u. Therefore, arc AC + arc CE + arc EA = (x + y) + (z + w) + (v + u) = 360° + (z + w). Wait, no, actually, arc AC + arc CE + arc EA would be x + y + z + w + v + u, which is the entire circle, 360°. Therefore, 220° (from arc AC) + (z + w) + 210° (from arc EA) = 360°. Therefore, z + w = 360° - 220° - 210° = -70°, which is impossible. Therefore, there must be a fundamental misunderstanding here.

This suggests that there's a mistake in how I'm interpreting which arcs the angles intercept.
</execution_5.2>

<execution_5.3>
Maybe the problem is that I'm assuming that the angle intercepts the arc between the two adjacent points, but maybe it's intercepting a different arc. Let me go back to the basics.

The key formula is: the measure of an inscribed angle is equal to half the measure of its intercepted arc. The intercepted arc is the arc that is opposite to the angle, not adjacent. So, for angle at B, which is formed by chords BA and BC, the intercepted arc is arc AC, which is the arc from A to C not passing through B. Similarly, angle at F is formed by chords FE and FB, so the intercepted arc is arc EB? Wait, no. Let's clarify.

If the hexagon is labeled A-B-C-D-E-F-A, then the angle at vertex B is between points A, B, C. So the sides are BA and BC. The inscribed angle at B intercepts the arc from A to C that does not include B. Since the hexagon is convex and inscribed in a circle, the arc AC not containing B would be the major arc if the minor arc AC is the one containing the other points. Wait, but without knowing the exact positions, it's hard to say. But in a convex polygon, the arcs between consecutive vertices are less than 180°, so maybe arcs AB, BC, etc. , are all less than 180°, making the intercepted arcs for the angles the major arcs.

Wait, perhaps the intercepted arc is the one that is opposite to the angle. For example, angle at B is between BA and BC, so the intercepted arc is the arc from A to C passing through the opposite side of the circle relative to B. If the polygon is convex, that would be the major arc AC. Therefore, angle B = 1/2 * measure of major arc AC.

Similarly, angle at F is between FE and FB, so the intercepted arc is the major arc from E to B. Wait, but arc from E to B passing through the opposite side of the circle relative to F. Hmm, this is getting confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the intercepted arc is the one that is not adjacent to the angle. So for angle at B, the intercepted arc is the arc that is opposite to B, which would be arc DF. Wait, no, that might not be. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the intercepted arc is the arc that is not between the two sides forming the angle. For angle at B, formed by BA and BC, the intercepted arc is the arc from A to C passing through the side opposite to B. If the hexagon is convex, then the arc AC that does not contain B. Similarly, angle at F is formed by FE and FB, so the intercepted arc is the arc from E to B passing through the side opposite to F. But since F is adjacent to E and A, the opposite side would be towards D and C. Wait, this is getting too vague.

Maybe I need to use a different approach. Let's consider that in a cyclic polygon, the sum of the measures of the angles is 720°, and each angle is related to the arcs. But without knowing the specific positions of the points, it's challenging to assign exact arcs. However, maybe we can use the given angles to set up equations.

Given that angle B is 110°, angle F is 105°, and angle D is α. If we can relate these angles to specific arcs, perhaps we can find α. Let's assume that each angle is equal to half the measure of the arc opposite to it. Therefore:

angle B = 1/2 * arc opposite to B

arc opposite to B would be the arc that is not adjacent to B. In a hexagon, each vertex has three opposite arcs? Wait, no. In a hexagon, each vertex is opposite to another vertex three steps away. For example, in a hexagon labeled A-B-C-D-E-F, vertex A is opposite to vertex D. Therefore, the arc opposite to angle B would be the arc from D to G? Wait, no, the hexagon only has six vertices. Wait, vertex B is opposite to vertex E. So the arc opposite to angle B (at vertex B) is the arc from D to E? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, the arc opposite to angle B is the arc that is not adjacent to B. So, angle B is between A, B, C. The opposite arc would be the arc that is between D, E, F. Therefore, arc DEF. But arc DEF is from D to F passing through E. So, if angle B is 110°, then arc DEF would be 220°, since 110° * 2 = 220°. Similarly, angle F is 105°, so the arc opposite to F would be the arc opposite to vertex F, which is arc BCD. Therefore, arc BCD = 210°. Angle D is α, so the arc opposite to D is arc ABC. Therefore, arc ABC = 2α.

Now, let's check if this works. The total of all arcs should be 360°, so arc DEF + arc BCD + arc ABC = 220° + 210° + 2α = 430° + 2α. But since these arcs overlap, this approach might be incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps each angle is half the measure of its opposite arc. So angle B = 1/2 * arc opposite to B. If angle B is 110°, then arc opposite to B is 220°. Similarly, angle F = 105°, so arc opposite to F is 210°, and angle D = α, so arc opposite to D is 2α. Then, since in a hexagon, the sum of the opposite arcs would be equal to the total circumference? Wait, no, because each arc is opposite to a single angle, but the arcs overlap. For example, arc opposite to B is DEF, arc opposite to F is BCD, and arc opposite to D is ABC. These arcs overlap significantly, so adding them would count overlapping regions multiple times, which isn't correct.

Alternatively, maybe each angle is half the sum of the arcs that are not adjacent to it. Wait, that might not make sense. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the measure of an inscribed angle in a cyclic polygon is equal to half the measure of the arc that is opposite to the angle, not adjacent. So, in a triangle, the angle is opposite to a side, which is an arc. In a quadrilateral, the angle is opposite to another angle, and the sum of opposite angles is 180°, which relates to the sum of their opposite arcs. But in a hexagon, each angle is part of multiple triangles. Hmm.

Alternatively, let me consider that in a cyclic hexagon, the sum of every other angle is 180°. Wait, no, that's for quadrilaterals. For hexagons, there's a different relation. Maybe the sum of angles in a cyclic hexagon can be related to the sum of their opposite angles. Wait, perhaps if we pair angles opposite each other.

In a cyclic hexagon with six vertices, each vertex has an opposite vertex three apart. So, vertex A opposite D, B opposite E, C opposite F. Therefore, angles at A and D are opposite, B and E are opposite, C and F are opposite. Then, maybe the sum of each pair of opposite angles is equal? If that's the case, then angle A + angle D = angle B + angle E = angle C + angle F. But in our problem, we only know three angles: B, D, F. If the pairs (A, D), (B, E), (C, F) each sum to the same value, then if we knew, for example, that angle B + angle E = angle C + angle F, but we don't know angles E and C. However, if we assume that all opposite angle pairs sum to the same total, then perhaps angle B + angle E = angle C + angle F = angle A + angle D. But without knowing more angles, this might not help.

Alternatively, maybe the sum of all opposite angle pairs equals the same value. But since we have three angles given, perhaps we can set up equations.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to refer back to the Asymptote code to determine the actual positions of the points and the angles. The Asymptote code labels the points as follows:

label("$105^\circ$", pF, N * 2);

label("$110^\circ$", pB, SW * 1.5);

label("$\alpha$", pD, E);

So, the angle at point F is 105°, at point B is 110°, and at point D is α. The labels are placed at the points, so the angles are at those vertices. Therefore, the angles at vertices F, B, and D are 105°, 110°, and α respectively.

Given that, perhaps using the earlier approach where the sum of arcs gives a negative value indicates a miscalculation. Let me check once again.

If angle at B is 110°, then the arc opposite to B (which would be arc DF, since in a hexagon, opposite arc might be different). Wait, maybe my initial assumption about which arc each angle intercepts was wrong. Let's try a different approach.

Let me consider that in a cyclic hexagon, each internal angle is equal to half the sum of the measures of the arcs intercepted by the two sides forming the angle. Wait, but in a triangle, the angle is half the measure of the opposite arc. In a quadrilateral, each angle is half the measure of the opposite arc. For a hexagon, maybe each internal angle is half the measure of the arc that is opposite to the angle, i.e., the arc that is not adjacent to the angle.

So, for angle at vertex B, the opposite arc would be the arc that is not adjacent to B. In a hexagon, vertex B is connected to A and C. The opposite arc would be the arc that is three vertices away. So from D, E, F. So arc DEF. Therefore, angle B = 1/2 * measure of arc DEF. Similarly, angle F is 1/2 * measure of arc ABC. Angle D is 1/2 * measure of arc BCF? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the opposite arc is the one that is separated by three edges. For angle at B, the opposite arc would be the arc that is three edges away, which is arc DF. So, angle B = 1/2 * arc DF. Similarly, angle F = 1/2 * arc ABC. Angle D = 1/2 * arc BCF? Wait, this is getting too vague.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to think of the hexagon as composed of triangles. For example, drawing lines from the center to each vertex divides the hexagon into six triangles. Each triangle's central angle corresponds to the arc between two vertices. The angle at each vertex of the hexagon is related to the sum of certain central angles.

Wait, but the angle at the vertex is an inscribed angle, not a central angle. The central angle corresponding to arc AB would be twice the inscribed angle at the circumference. Wait, no. The central angle is equal to the measure of the arc. The inscribed angle is half the central angle. Therefore, inscribed angle = 1/2 * central angle.

Therefore, if we can find the central angles corresponding to each side, we can relate them to the inscribed angles.

But without knowing the exact positions, this might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is to recognize that in a cyclic hexagon, the sum of every other angle is 180 degrees. Wait, is that a general rule? For example, in a cyclic hexagon, is there a relation like α + angle C = 180°, or something similar? I need to verify.

Wait, actually, in a cyclic hexagon, there isn't a straightforward relationship like in quadrilaterals. However, there is a formula that relates the sum of the angles to 720°, but that's the total sum. To find individual angles, we need more information. However, in this problem, we are given three angles and need to find the fourth. The Asymptote code labels angles at B, D, and F, so maybe those are the ones related by some symmetry or property.

Wait, looking back at the Asymptote code, the labels are:

label("$105^\circ$", pF, N * 2);

label("$110^\circ$", pB, SW * 1.5);

label("$\alpha$", pD, E);

So, the angles at points F, B, and D are 105°, 110°, and α. The other angles at points A, C, E are not given. However, if we can relate these given angles to the arcs, perhaps we can find α.

Given that, let's try again.

Assume that each angle is equal to half the measure of the arc opposite to it. So:

angle at B (110°) = 1/2 * arc opposite to B

arc opposite to B would be the arc that is not adjacent to B. In a hexagon, vertex B is adjacent to A and C, so the opposite arc would be from D to F. So arc DF. Therefore, angle B = 1/2 * arc DF = 110°, so arc DF = 220°.

Similarly, angle at F (105°) = 1/2 * arc opposite to F.

Vertex F is adjacent to E and A, so the opposite arc would be from B to D. Therefore, arc BD. Therefore, angle F = 1/2 * arc BD = 105°, so arc BD = 210°.

Angle at D (α) = 1/2 * arc opposite to D.

Vertex D is adjacent to C and E, so the opposite arc would be from F to B. Therefore, arc FB. Therefore, angle D = 1/2 * arc FB = α, so arc FB = 2α.

Now, let's see if we can express the total circumference in terms of these arcs.

The circle is divided into arcs AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA. Let's denote them as follows:

arc AB = x

arc BC = y

arc CD = z

arc DE = w

arc EF = v

arc FA = u

Then, the sum x + y + z + w + v + u = 360°.

Now, arc DF is arc D to F, which would be arc DE + arc EF = w + v. From earlier, arc DF = 220°, so w + v = 220°.

Arc BD is arc B to D, which is arc BC + arc CD + arc DE = y + z + w. From earlier, arc BD = 210°, so y + z + w = 210°.

Arc FB is arc F to B, which is arc FA + arc AB = u + x. From earlier, arc FB = 2α, so u + x = 2α.

Now, we have:

1. w + v = 220°

2. y + z + w = 210°

3. u + x = 2α

Also, the total sum:

x + y + z + w + v + u = 360°

Substitute equations 1 and 2 into the total sum:

From equation 2: y + z + w = 210°

From equation 1: w + v = 220°, so v = 220° - w

Therefore, substituting into the total sum:

x + y + z + w + (220° - w) + u = 360°

Simplify:

x + y + z + w + 220° - w + u = 360°

The w terms cancel:

x + y + z + u + 220° = 360°

Therefore:

x + y + z + u = 140°

But from equation 3, u + x = 2α, so substituting:

(2α) + y + z = 140°

So, y + z + 2α = 140°

Hmm, but we need another equation to relate y and z. However, we don't have more given angles. Wait, unless there's another relationship.

Alternatively, maybe considering that the sum of all arcs is 360°, and we have some expressions for parts of the arcs. Let me list all known equations:

1. w + v = 220°

2. y + z + w = 210°

3. u + x = 2α

4. x + y + z + u = 140°

From equation 4, we have x + y + z + u = 140°, which can be written as (x + u) + (y + z) = 140°. From equation 3, x + u = 2α, so substituting:

2α + (y + z) = 140°

But we need another equation involving y + z. However, from equation 2: y + z + w = 210°, so y + z = 210° - w. Therefore:

2α + (210° - w) = 140°

So, 2α = 140° - 210° + w

2α = -70° + w

But we need another equation involving w. From equation 1: w + v = 220°, so v = 220° - w. But we don't have other equations involving v.

Wait, unless there's a way to relate v to other variables. However, without additional given angles or relationships, it's difficult to proceed. This suggests that there might be a mistake in the approach, as we are not able to solve for α with the given information.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a specific configuration where the hexagon has some symmetry, allowing us to determine the arcs. For example, if the hexagon is symmetric with respect to a certain axis, some arcs might be equal. However, the Asymptote code shows that the points are placed at specific angles, which might not necessarily imply symmetry.

Looking at the Asymptote code, the points are placed at:

- pA: pO + dir(-10)

- pB: pO + dir(60)

- pC: pO + dir(130)

- pD: pO + dir(170)

- pE: pO + dir(230)

- pF: pO + dir(310)

So, in terms of angles from the positive x-axis (3 o'clock position), the points are at:

A: -10°

B: 60°

C: 130°

D: 170°

E: 230°

F: 310°

Therefore, the arcs between the points can be calculated as the difference in their angles.

Let's compute the arcs between consecutive points:

arc AB: from A (-10°) to B (60°). The angle between them is 60° - (-10°) = 70°. But since arcs are measured as the smallest angle between two points, but in a circle, the arc can be measured in two directions. However, in a cyclic polygon, the arcs are typically considered as the smaller arcs unless specified otherwise. However, in this case, since the points are placed around the circle, the arcs between them can be calculated as the difference in their angles, considering the direction.

Wait, actually, the central angle between two points is the absolute difference of their angles if we take the smaller arc. However, in a circle, the arc can be measured in either direction, but the inscribed angle depends on the arc that is intercepted. So, to compute the arc lengths:

arc AB: from A (-10°) to B (60°). The angle between them is 60° - (-10°) = 70°, but since moving clockwise from A to B is 70°, but counterclockwise would be 360° - 70° = 290°. However, the inscribed angle would be half the measure of the arc opposite to the angle. Wait, perhaps I need to compute each arc as the absolute difference in their angles, but considering the direction.

Alternatively, perhaps the arc length between two points is the difference in their angles if moving in the positive (counterclockwise) direction. However, since the points are placed at specific angles, let's list their positions with their angles:

- A: -10° (which is equivalent to 350°)

- B: 60°

- C: 130°

- D: 170°

- E: 230°

- F: 310°

Now, to compute the arcs between consecutive points:

arc AB: from A (350°) to B (60°). The smaller arc is 60° - 350° = -290°, but since we take absolute value, 290°, but since it's a circle, the smaller arc is actually 70° (360° - 290°). Wait, but 350° to 60°, moving clockwise is 70°, and counterclockwise is 290°. So, the arc AB is 70°, as the smaller arc.

Similarly:

arc BC: from B (60°) to C (130°). The difference is 130° - 60° = 70°, so arc BC is 70°.

arc CD: from C (130°) to D (170°). Difference is 40°, so arc CD is 40°.

arc DE: from D (170°) to E (230°). Difference is 60°, so arc DE is 60°.

arc EF: from E (230°) to F (310°). Difference is 80°, so arc EF is 80°.

arc FA: from F (310°) to A (350°). Difference is 40°, so arc FA is 40°.

Wait, let's verify these arcs:

arc AB: 60° - (-10°) = 70° (smallest arc)

arc BC: 130° - 60° = 70°

arc CD: 170° - 130°
