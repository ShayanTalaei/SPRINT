Okay, so I need to solve this functional equation problem. The function f satisfies the equation f(x) + f(y) = f(x + y) - xy - 1 for all real numbers x and y. Also, we know that f(1) = 1. The goal is to find all integers n such that f(n) = n. Hmm, functional equations can be tricky, but maybe I can figure it out step by step.

First, let me recall some common techniques for solving functional equations. Often, substituting specific values for x and y can help simplify the equation and reveal the form of the function. Since the equation must hold for all real numbers, choosing particular values like x = 0, y = 0, x = y, or setting one variable as the negative of the other might be helpful.

Let me try substituting x = 0 and y = 0 first. That might give me some information about f(0).

But maybe I should check another value. Let's try n=3.

<prompt_1.2> Verify if f(3) = 3 using the derived formula. </prompt_1.2>

Alternatively, maybe I can approach this by assuming the function is a polynomial. Since the functional equation involves terms like xy, which are quadratic, maybe f(x) is a quadratic function. Let me assume f(x) is a quadratic polynomial: f(x) = ax² + bx + c.

<prompt_1.3> Assume f(x) is a quadratic polynomial and solve for coefficients a, b, and c. </prompt_1.3>

So, substituting x = 0 and y = 0 into the equation:

f(0) + f(0) = f(0 + 0) - (0)(0) - 1

Simplifying the right side: f(0) - 0 - 1 = f(0) - 1

So, left side is 2f(0), right side is f(0) - 1. Therefore:

2f(0) = f(0) - 1

Subtract f(0) from both sides:

f(0) = -1
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
If f(n) = n, then substituting n=3, we get f(3) = 3. Let's check if that's consistent with the function we found. From the formula f(n) = n² - n - 1, plugging in n=3 gives 9 - 3 -1 = 5, which is not equal to 3. So, f(3) =5 ≠3, so 3 is not a solution.
</execution_1.2>

<execution_1.3>
Then let's substitute into the functional equation:

f(x) + f(y) = a x² + b x + c + a y² + b y + c = a(x² + y²) + b(x + y) + 2c.

On the other hand, f(x + y) - xy -1 = a(x + y)² + b(x + y) + c - xy -1 = a(x² + 2xy + y²) + b(x + y) + c - xy -1.

Simplify the right-hand side: a x² + 2a xy + a y² + b x + b y + c - xy -1.

Now, equate the coefficients from both sides.

Left-hand side: a(x² + y²) + b(x + y) + 2c.

Right-hand side: a x² + a y² + (2a -1)xy + b x + b y + (c -1).

Comparing coefficients:

1. For x² and y²: Both sides have a, so that matches.
2. For xy: Left side has 0, right side has (2a -1). Therefore, 2a -1 = 0 => a = 1/2.
3. For x and y: Both sides have b, so that's consistent.
4. Constants: Left side has 2c, right side has (c -1). Therefore, 2c = c -1 => c = -1.

So, if f(x) is a quadratic polynomial, then a = 1/2, c = -1, and b is still unknown. Wait, but in the functional equation, when we compared coefficients, the coefficients for x and y matched on both sides (they both had b), so b is not determined by this comparison. Hmm, so maybe we need another equation to find b?

But we have the condition f(1) = 1. Let's use that.

f(1) = (1/2)(1)^2 + b(1) -1 = 1/2 + b -1 = b - 1/2. And this is equal to 1. Therefore, b - 1/2 = 1 => b = 3/2.

Therefore, the polynomial is f(x) = (1/2)x² + (3/2)x -1.

Based on execution_1.1:
Next, maybe set y = 1 and see what happens. Since we know f(1) = 1, this might help express f(x + 1) in terms of f(x).

Let me try that. Let y = 1. Then the equation becomes:

f(x) + f(1) = f(x + 1) - x*1 - 1

Substituting f(1) = 1:

f(x) + 1 = f(x + 1) - x - 1

Rearranging to solve for f(x + 1):

f(x + 1) = f(x) + 1 + x + 1 = f(x) + x + 2

So, we have a recursive formula: f(x + 1) = f(x) + x + 2. This might be useful. Maybe we can use this to express f(n) for integer n in terms of f(0) or f(1).

Since we need to find integers n where f(n) = n, let's consider integer values. Let's first compute f(2).

<prompt_2.1> Use the recursive formula to compute f(2) and f(3). </prompt_2.1>

Based on execution_1.3:
Let me check if this function satisfies the original functional equation.

Compute left-hand side: f(x) + f(y) = (1/2 x² + 3/2 x -1) + (1/2 y² + 3/2 y -1) = 1/2(x² + y²) + 3/2(x + y) -2.

Right-hand side: f(x + y) - xy -1 = [1/2(x + y)^2 + 3/2(x + y) -1] - xy -1.

<prompt_2.2> Verify if the derived polynomial satisfies the original functional equation. </prompt_2.2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Using the recursive formula with x = 1:

f(1 + 1) = f(1) + 1 + 2 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4. So f(2) = 4.

Similarly, f(3) = f(2) + 2 + 2 = 4 + 2 + 2 = 8. Wait, but let me verify that. Wait, the formula is f(x + 1) = f(x) + x + 2. So when x = 2, f(3) = f(2) + 2 + 2 = 4 + 4 = 8. Hmm, okay.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Let's expand f(x + y):

1/2(x² + 2xy + y²) + 3/2(x + y) -1 - xy -1

= 1/2 x² + xy + 1/2 y² + 3/2 x + 3/2 y -1 - xy -1

Combine like terms:

1/2 x² + 1/2 y² + xy - xy + 3/2 x + 3/2 y -1 -1 -1

Wait, the xy terms: xy - xy cancels out. Then we have 1/2 x² + 1/2 y² + 3/2 x + 3/2 y -3.

So, right-hand side simplifies to 1/2 x² + 1/2 y² + 3/2 x + 3/2 y -3.

Comparing with left-hand side: 1/2(x² + y²) + 3/2(x + y) -2. Which is the same as 1/2 x² + 1/2 y² + 3/2 x + 3/2 y -2.

But the right-hand side is that minus 1 more, so -3. Therefore, the left-hand side is -2, right-hand side is -3. Wait, that's a problem. They are not equal. There's a discrepancy here. So, my assumption that f is a quadratic polynomial might be wrong, or I made a mistake in the calculation.

But wait, maybe I should check for n = 0 as well. Let's see.

<prompt_3.1> Verify if f(0) = 0 using the recursive formula. </prompt_3.1>

How about negative integers? Let's check n = -1.

Let me check my steps again. Maybe I made an error in expanding or substituting.

<prompt_3.3> Re-evaluate the polynomial solution by checking the functional equation again. </prompt_3.3>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
From earlier, f(0) = -1. If n = 0, then f(0) = -1, which is not equal to 0. So, 0 is not a solution.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
To compute f(-1), maybe we can use the recursive formula in reverse. Let's set x = -1 and y = 1 in the original equation.

Wait, but if we set x = -1 and y = 1, then f(-1) + f(1) = f(0) - (-1)(1) -1.

We know f(0) = -1, f(1) = 1, so:

f(-1) + 1 = -1 - (-1)(1) -1 = -1 +1 -1 = -1.

Therefore, f(-1) + 1 = -1 => f(-1) = -2.

Alternatively, using the recursive formula f(x + 1) = f(x) + x + 2. Let me solve for f(x) when x is negative. Let me set x = -1:

f(0) = f(-1) + (-1) + 2 => -1 = f(-1) +1 => f(-1) = -2. That's the same result. So f(-1) = -2.

Similarly, f(-2) can be found by setting x = -1 in the original equation with y = -1:

f(-1) + f(-1) = f(-2) - (-1)(-1) -1 => -2 + (-2) = f(-2) -1 -1 => -4 = f(-2) -2 => f(-2) = -2.
</execution_3.2>

<execution_3.3>
Original functional equation: f(x) + f(y) = f(x + y) - xy -1.

If f(x) = (1/2)x² + (3/2)x -1, then compute f(x) + f(y):

(1/2 x² + 3/2 x -1) + (1/2 y² + 3/2 y -1) = 1/2 x² + 1/2 y² + 3/2 x + 3/2 y -2.

Compute f(x + y) - xy -1:

(1/2 (x + y)^2 + 3/2 (x + y) -1) - xy -1

= 1/2 (x² + 2xy + y²) + 3/2 x + 3/2 y -1 - xy -1

= 1/2 x² + xy + 1/2 y² + 3/2 x + 3/2 y -1 - xy -1

= 1/2 x² + 1/2 y² + 3/2 x + 3/2 y -2.

Wait, that's the same as the left-hand side. So actually, it does work. So my earlier confusion was misplaced.

Based on execution_3.3:
Therefore, the function is f(x) = (1/2)x² + (3/2)x -1. Let me simplify that:

<execution_4.1>
f(-2) = -2. Then f(-2) = -2. Let's see if that's consistent with the function. Wait, according to our formula, f(-2) = (1/2)(4) + (3/2)(-2) -1 = 2 -3 -1 = -2. Correct. So f(-2) = -2.
</execution_4.1>

<execution_4.2>
f(x) = (x² + 3x - 2)/2.

Let me check for n=1: (1 + 3 -2)/2 = 2/2 =1. Correct. n=2: (4 +6 -2)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=3: (9 +9 -2)/2=16/2=8. Correct. n=-1: (1 -3 -2)/2=(-4)/2=-2. Correct. n=-2: (4 -6 -2)/2=(-4)/2=-2. Correct. So this formula works for these integers.

So, in general, f(n) = (n² + 3n -2)/2 for integer n. We need to find all integers n such that f(n) = n. Therefore:

(n² + 3n -2)/2 = n

Multiply both sides by 2:

n² + 3n -2 = 2n

Subtract 2n:

n² + n -2 = 0

Factor the quadratic equation:

n² + n -2 = (n + 2)(n - 1) = 0

Therefore, the solutions are n = -2 and n = 1.

<Plan_5>
Based on execution_4.2:
Wait, but let me check if there are other integer solutions. The equation n² + n -2 = 0 has only two roots: -2 and 1. So, these are the only solutions.

But let's verify this with the function. For example, take n=1: f(1)=1, which works. n=-2: f(-2)=(-2)^2 +3*(-2) -2)/2=(4-6-2)/2=(-4)/2=-2. So yes, f(-2)=-2. What about n=2: f(2)= (4 +6 -2)/2=8/2=4≠2. n=3: (9 +9 -2)/2=16/2=8≠3. n=0: (-2)/2=-1≠0. n=4: (16 +12 -2)/2=26/2=13≠4. Similarly, negative numbers: n=-1: (-1 + (-3) -2)/2=(-6)/2=-3≠-1. n=-3: (9 + (-9) -2)/2=(-2)/2=-1≠-3. So only n=-2 and n=1 satisfy f(n)=n.
