\[\frac{x - y}{x^4 + y^4 + 6}\]over all real numbers $x$ and $y.$
</Question>

<think>
<Plan_1>
Alright, so I need to find the maximum value of the expression (x - y)/(x⁴ + y⁴ + 6) where x and y are real numbers. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.

<prompt_1.1> Understand the problem and set up the expression to be maximized. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
First, the expression is a fraction where the numerator is linear in x and y, and the denominator is a quartic polynomial plus a constant. Since the denominator is always positive (x⁴ and y⁴ are non-negative, and adding 6 makes it at least 6), there's no issue with the denominator being zero or negative. So the sign of the entire expression depends on the numerator, x - y. To maximize the fraction, we want x - y to be as large as possible relative to the denominator.

But how do we balance making x - y large while keeping x⁴ + y⁴ + 6 from becoming too large as well? Because if x and y get too big, the denominator could dominate and make the whole expression small. So there's a trade-off here between the numerator and the denominator.

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Maybe I can use some inequality to relate the numerator and the denominator. For example, maybe Cauchy-Schwarz or AM-GM inequalities? Let me think. The denominator has x⁴ and y⁴ terms. If I can bound x⁴ + y⁴ in terms of (x - y), that might help. Alternatively, maybe I can set variables in terms of x - y and some other variable. Let me try substitution.

Let me set t = x - y. Then, perhaps express x in terms of y and t: x = y + t. Then substitute this into the denominator.

So substituting x = y + t into the denominator: (y + t)⁴ + y⁴ + 6. Then the expression becomes t / [(y + t)⁴ + y⁴ + 6]. Now, we can consider this as a function of y and t, and try to maximize it.
But maybe it's easier to fix t and then find the maximum over y. Alternatively, maybe fix y and optimize over t. Hmm, not sure yet.

Alternatively, maybe use symmetry. Suppose we set x = a and y = -b, then x - y = a + b, and the denominator becomes a⁴ + b⁴ + 6. Then the problem becomes maximizing (a + b)/(a⁴ + b⁴ + 6). But I don't know if that helps.

<prompt_2.1> Consider variable substitution and symmetry to simplify the problem. </prompt_2.1>

Alternatively, maybe use calculus. Let's consider treating x and y as variables and take partial derivatives. Let me denote the function as f(x, y) = (x - y)/(x⁴ + y⁴ + 6). To find its critical points, compute the partial derivatives with respect to x and y, set them to zero, and solve.

First, compute ∂f/∂x:

<prompt_2.2> Use calculus to find critical points and verify maximum value. </prompt_2.2>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps assume that the maximum occurs when y is negative? Not sure. Maybe not necessary.

Alternatively, consider using the method of Lagrange multipliers. Since we want to maximize (x - y) subject to the constraint x⁴ + y⁴ + 6 being minimized. But that might not be straightforward.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Using the quotient rule: [(1)(x⁴ + y⁴ + 6) - (x - y)(4x³)] / (x⁴ + y⁴ + 6)²

Similarly, ∂f/∂y:

[(-1)(x⁴ + y⁴ + 6) - (x - y)(4y³)] / (x⁴ + y⁴ + 6)²

Set both partial derivatives to zero. Therefore, the numerators must be zero:

For ∂f/∂x: x⁴ + y⁴ + 6 - 4x³(x - y) = 0

For ∂f/∂y: - (x⁴ + y⁴ + 6) - 4y³(x - y) = 0

So we have two equations:

1) x⁴ + y⁴ + 6 = 4x³(x - y)

2) - (x⁴ + y⁴ + 6) - 4y³(x - y) = 0

Let me write equation 2 as:

- (x⁴ + y⁴ + 6) = 4y³(x - y)

But from equation 1, x⁴ + y⁴ + 6 = 4x³(x - y). Substitute this into equation 2:

- [4x³(x - y)] = 4y³(x - y)

Simplify:

-4x³(x - y) = 4y³(x - y)

Divide both sides by 4(x - y), assuming x ≠ y (since if x = y, the numerator is zero, which would make the function zero, which is likely not the maximum). So dividing by 4(x - y):

- x³ = y³

Which implies that y = -x. Because if y³ = -x³, then y = -x (since cube roots are unique). So y = -x.

So substitute y = -x into equation 1:

x⁴ + (-x)⁴ + 6 = 4x³(x - (-x))

Simplify:

x⁴ + x⁴ + 6 = 4x³(2x)

2x⁴ + 6 = 8x⁴

Subtract 2x⁴ from both sides:

6 = 6x⁴

Therefore, x⁴ = 1, so x = ±1.

Thus, possible solutions are x = 1, y = -1 and x = -1, y = 1.

Compute f(1, -1):

(1 - (-1))/(1⁴ + (-1)⁴ + 6) = (2)/(1 + 1 + 6) = 2/8 = 1/4

Similarly, f(-1, 1):

(-1 -1)/((-1)^4 +1^4 +6)= (-2)/(1 +1 +6)= -2/8= -1/4

So the maximum value found via critical points is 1/4.

Based on execution_2.2:
But wait, is this the global maximum? We need to check if there are other critical points or if the maximum occurs at infinity.

<prompt_3.1> Verify if the critical point found using calculus is the global maximum. </prompt_3.1>

But let's check if there's a possibility of a higher value when x and y are not related by y = -x. For example, suppose we set y = 0.

<prompt_3.2> Explore other potential points and use AM-GM inequality to confirm the maximum value. </prompt_3.2>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
Let's check the behavior as x and y go to infinity. Suppose both x and y go to infinity. Then the denominator x⁴ + y⁴ + 6 grows like x⁴ + y⁴, which is much faster than the numerator x - y, which grows linearly. So the expression tends to zero. Similarly, if one variable goes to infinity and the other is fixed. For example, x goes to infinity, y fixed. Then denominator is ~x⁴, numerator ~x, so expression ~x / x⁴ = 1/x³ → 0. Similarly if y goes to infinity and x is fixed. So the expression tends to zero at infinity, which suggests that the maximum is attained at some finite point.

Similarly, if we set x = t and y = -t, then as t increases, the expression becomes (2t)/(2t⁴ + 6) = 2t/(2t⁴ +6) = t/(t⁴ +3), which tends to zero. So along this line, the maximum occurs at t=1, which we already found. So maybe 1/4 is indeed the maximum.

But to be thorough, let's check other possible critical points. Suppose we consider other cases when solving the partial derivatives. Wait, when we divided by (x - y), we assumed x ≠ y. What if x = y? Then the numerator is zero, so the function is zero, which is not a maximum. So the only critical points are when y = -x, leading to x = ±1, and the maximum value of 1/4.

Alternatively, maybe there are other critical points where the partial derivatives are zero but not captured by this method? Let's see. For example, suppose that when we set the partial derivatives to zero, we derived that y = -x. But maybe there are other solutions where x - y = 0, but as we saw, that gives zero. So the only critical points are along y = -x. Therefore, the maximum is indeed 1/4.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
Then the expression becomes x/(x⁴ + 0 + 6) = x/(x⁴ + 6). To maximize this, take derivative with respect to x:

[(1)(x⁴ +6) - x(4x³)]/(x⁴ +6)^2 = (x⁴ +6 -4x⁴)/(x⁴ +6)^2 = (-3x⁴ +6)/(x⁴ +6)^2

Set numerator to zero: -3x⁴ +6 =0 => x⁴=2 => x=±√[4]{2}

Compute the maximum value: x/(x⁴ +6) = √[4]{2}/(2 +6)= √[4]{2}/8 ≈1.1892/8≈0.1486, which is less than 1/4≈0.25. So in this case, lower.

Similarly, if we set x=0, then the expression is (-y)/(0 + y⁴ +6). To maximize this, since it's (-y)/(y⁴ +6), the maximum occurs at the minimum of y/(y⁴ +6). Which would be when y is negative. Let y = -k, k>0, then it's k/(k⁴ +6). Same as before, maximum at k=√[4]{2}, value≈0.1486. So again, less than 1/4.

Alternatively, suppose we set y = x - t, but that might complicate. Alternatively, maybe use AM-GM inequality on the denominator.

Wait, the denominator is x⁴ + y⁴ +6. Let's see if we can relate x⁴ + y⁴ to (x - y)^4 or something. But maybe not directly.

Alternatively, note that x⁴ + y⁴ >= (x² - y²)^2 / 2 by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality? Wait, not sure. Let me recall that for any real numbers a and b, a⁴ + b⁴ >= (a² + b²)^2 / 2. Is that true?

Yes, because (a² + b²)^2 = a⁴ + 2a²b² + b⁴ <= 2(a⁴ + b⁴) by AM-GM (since 2a²b² <= a⁴ + b⁴). Therefore, a⁴ + b⁴ >= (a² + b²)^2 / 2.

So applying that to x⁴ + y⁴, we have x⁴ + y⁴ >= (x² + y²)^2 / 2.

But how does that help? Let's see. Then the denominator x⁴ + y⁴ +6 >= (x² + y²)^2 / 2 +6.

So the expression (x - y)/(x⁴ + y⁴ +6) <= (x - y)/[(x² + y²)^2 / 2 +6].

But not sure if this helps. Alternatively, maybe try to bound the denominator in terms of (x - y).

Alternatively, use Hölder's inequality. Hmm.

Alternatively, consider substituting variables. Let me set u = x - y and v = x + y. Then x = (u + v)/2 and y = (v - u)/2. Maybe this substitution can simplify things.

Compute x⁴ + y⁴:

[(u + v)/2]^4 + [(v - u)/2]^4.

Let me compute this:

= [ (u + v)^4 + (v - u)^4 ] / 16

Expanding both terms:

= [ (u^4 + 4u³v + 6u²v² + 4uv³ + v^4) + (v^4 -4u³v +6u²v² -4uv³ +u^4) ] /16

Combine like terms:

= [ 2u^4 + 12u²v² + 2v^4 ] /16

= [ u^4 + 6u²v² + v^4 ] /8

Therefore, x⁴ + y⁴ = (u⁴ + 6u²v² + v⁴)/8

Therefore, the denominator becomes (u⁴ + 6u²v² + v⁴)/8 +6 = (u⁴ + 6u²v² + v⁴ + 48)/8

So the expression becomes u / [ (u⁴ + 6u²v² + v⁴ + 48)/8 ] = 8u / (u⁴ + 6u²v² + v⁴ + 48)

So now, we need to maximize 8u / (u⁴ + 6u²v² + v⁴ + 48) over real numbers u and v.

Hmm, but this seems more complicated. Maybe not the best substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps assume that x and y are non-negative? Wait, but x - y could be maximized when y is negative. For example, if y is negative, then x - y becomes x + |y|, which could be larger. So maybe we need to consider y negative.

But in the critical point analysis, we found that y = -x gives the maximum. So perhaps that's the case where the maximum occurs.

Alternatively, let's check another case where y is negative. Suppose y = -k where k >0. Then the expression becomes (x + k)/(x⁴ + k⁴ +6). To maximize this, perhaps set x =k? Let's try x =k. Then numerator is 2k, denominator is 2k⁴ +6. Then the expression is 2k/(2k⁴ +6)=k/(k⁴ +3). The maximum of this occurs when derivative is zero. Let’s compute derivative:

[(1)(k⁴ +3) -k(4k³)]/(k⁴ +3)^2 = (k⁴ +3 -4k⁴)/(k⁴ +3)^2 = (-3k⁴ +3)/(k⁴ +3)^2. Setting numerator to zero: -3k⁴ +3=0 =>k⁴=1 =>k=1. So maximum value is 1/(1 +3)=1/4. So same as before. So when x =1, y=-1, we get 2/(2 +6)=1/4.

Alternatively, if x ≠k. Suppose x is different from k. Let's see. Let’s suppose x = t and y = -k, then the expression is (t +k)/(t⁴ +k⁴ +6). To maximize this, maybe set t =k? As above, which gives 2k/(2k⁴ +6). Then maximum at k=1 gives 1/4. If we don't set t =k, maybe the value is lower. For example, let’s take k=1, t=2. Then expression is 3/(16 +1 +6)=3/23≈0.1304 <1/4. If t=0, then expression is1/(0 +1 +6)=1/7≈0.1429 <1/4. If t= -1, then expression is0/(1 +1 +6)=0. So indeed, maximum occurs at t=k=1.

Therefore, seems like 1/4 is the maximum. But to confirm, let's consider another approach.

Based on execution_2.2:
But let's verify if there are other critical points or if the maximum is indeed at x=1, y=-1. Let's consider the case when x and y are both positive or both negative.

Alternatively, use the AM-GM inequality on the denominator. Let me think.

</Execution_3>

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.2:
The AM-GM inequality states that for non-negative real numbers, the arithmetic mean is at least the geometric mean. However, since x and y can be any real numbers, we need to be careful. But perhaps consider x⁴ + y⁴ +6.

Let me split 6 into 6 ones: x⁴ + y⁴ +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1. Then apply AM-GM on these 8 terms.

<prompt_4.1> Apply AM-GM inequality to verify the maximum value of the expression. </prompt_4.1>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
The arithmetic mean is (x⁴ + y⁴ +6)/8 >= (x⁴ * y⁴ *1*1*1*1*1*1)^(1/8) = (x⁴ y⁴)^(1/8) = (x y)^(1/2).

Therefore, (x⁴ + y⁴ +6)/8 >= sqrt(x y). But this seems a bit messy because sqrt(x y) could be imaginary if x and y have opposite signs. Hmm, maybe not the right approach.

Alternatively, if we assume x and y are non-negative, then AM-GM can be applied more straightforwardly. Let's suppose x and y are non-negative. Then x⁴ + y⁴ +6 >= 3*(x⁴ y⁴ 6)^(1/3) by AM-GM. Wait, but that gives a lower bound on the denominator, which would give an upper bound on the expression. But this might not be tight enough.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that x⁴ + y⁴ >= (x² + y²)^2 / 2 as before. Then x⁴ + y⁴ +6 >= (x² + y²)^2 / 2 +6. Let’s denote s = x² + y². Then the denominator is >= s² / 2 +6. The numerator is |x - y|. So the expression is <= |x - y| / (s² / 2 +6). But we need to relate |x - y| to s. Note that |x - y| <= sqrt(2s) by Cauchy-Schwarz, since (x - y)^2 <= 2(x² + y²) = 2s. Therefore, |x - y| <= sqrt(2s). Therefore, the expression is <= sqrt(2s) / (s² /2 +6). Let’s denote t = sqrt(2s), so s = t² /2. Then the expression becomes t / ( ( (t² /2)^2 ) /2 +6 ) = t / ( t^4 /8 +6 ). So we need to maximize t / (t^4 /8 +6). Let’s set f(t) = t / (t^4 /8 +6). To find its maximum, take derivative:

f’(t) = [1*(t^4 /8 +6) - t*( (4t³)/8 ) ] / (t^4 /8 +6)^2

Simplify numerator:

= (t^4 /8 +6) - (4t⁴ /8 )

= (t^4 /8 +6 - t^4 /2 )

= ( -3t^4 /8 +6 )

Set numerator to zero:

-3t^4 /8 +6 =0 => t^4 = 16 => t = 2 (since t is non-negative).

Thus, maximum at t=2. Then f(2)=2/(16/8 +6)=2/(2 +6)=2/8=1/4. So again, we get maximum value 1/4. Therefore, this approach also leads to 1/4. So even when considering the AM-GM and bounding, the maximum is 1/4. Therefore, this seems to confirm that the maximum value is indeed 1/4.

<Plan_5>
Based on execution_4.1:
But to be thorough, let's check if there are other critical points when we didn't assume y = -x. Wait, from the partial derivatives, we concluded that y = -x is the only possibility, so all critical points must satisfy y = -x, leading to x = ±1. So there are no other critical points.
