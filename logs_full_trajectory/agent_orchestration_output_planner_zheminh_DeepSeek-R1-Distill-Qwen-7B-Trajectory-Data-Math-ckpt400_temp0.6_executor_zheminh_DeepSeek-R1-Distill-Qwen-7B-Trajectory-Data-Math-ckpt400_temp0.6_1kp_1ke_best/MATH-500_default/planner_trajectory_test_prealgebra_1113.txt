Okay, let's see. I need to find the positive square root of the product of 10, 15, and 24. Hmm, first, maybe I should calculate the product first and then take the square root. Let me start by multiplying those numbers together.

So, 10 times 15 is... 10 multiplied by 15 is 150, right? Then, 150 multiplied by 24. Hmm, let's break that down. 150 times 20 is 3000, and 150 times 4 is 600. Adding those together gives 3000 + 600 = 3600. Wait, so the product of 10, 15, and 24 is 3600?

Based on execution_1.1:
Then, the square root of 3600. Hmm, do I know what the square root of 3600 is? Let me think. I know that 60 times 60 is 3600 because 6 times 6 is 36, and then adding two zeros gives 3600. So, √3600 should be 60.

But wait, let me verify that again to be sure.
60 squared is 60×60. 6×6 is 36, and then the zeros add two zeros, so yes, 3600.

But maybe I should check if there's another way to approach this problem, like factoring the numbers first before multiplying. Sometimes, breaking them down into prime factors can make finding the square root easier.

Let me try that method as well to confirm. Let's factor each number:

<prompt_2.1> Factor each number into its prime factors as per the above plan. </prompt_2.1>

Alternatively, recognizing that 10*15*24 can be grouped differently. For example, 10*24 first.

<prompt_2.2> Explore alternative grouping of numbers to simplify multiplication and square root calculation as per the above plan. </prompt_2.2>

Another check: if I didn't recognize that 3600 is a perfect square, maybe I could use prime factorization to find the square root. Let's see, breaking down 3600 into primes:

<prompt_2.3> Use prime factorization to find the square root of 3600 as per the above plan. </prompt_2.3>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
10: The prime factors of 10 are 2 and 5 (since 10 = 2 × 5).
15: The prime factors of 15 are 3 and 5 (15 = 3 × 5).
24: Let's see, 24 divided by 2 is 12, divided by 2 again is 6, and again is 3. So, 24 = 2³ × 3.

So, multiplying all these together: 2 × 5 × 3 × 5 × 2³ × 3. Let me write that out:
- 2 appears 1 + 3 times: 2⁴
- 3 appears 1 + 1 times: 3²
- 5 appears 1 + 1 times: 5²

So, the product is 2⁴ × 3² × 5². Now, to find the square root of this product. The square root of a product is the product of the square roots, so √(2⁴ × 3² × 5²) = √(2⁴) × √(3²) × √(5²). Calculating each square root:
- √(2⁴) = 2² = 4
- √(3²) = 3
- √(5²) = 5

Multiplying these together: 4 × 3 × 5 = 60. So, that confirms it again.

<execution_2.2>
10*24 is 240, then 240*15. Let's compute that. 240*10 is 2400, and 240*5 is 1200, so 2400+1200=3600. Same result. Then square root is 60.
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
3600 ÷ 2 = 1800  
1800 ÷ 2 = 900  
900 ÷ 2 = 450  
450 ÷ 2 = 225  
225 ÷ 3 = 75  
75 ÷ 3 = 25  
25 ÷ 5 = 5  
5 ÷ 5 = 1  

So, the prime factors are 2^4 × 3^2 × 5^2. Then, the square root would be 2^(4/2) × 3^(2/2) × 5^(2/2) = 2^2 × 3 × 5 = 4 × 3 × 5 = 60.
</execution_2.3>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Wait, did I do that right? Let me check again.
10 is 2×5, 15 is 3×5, and 24 is 2³×3. So combining all factors: 2^(1+3) × 3^(1+1) × 5^(1+1) = 2⁴ × 3² × 5².
Taking the square root, which is the same as raising each factor to the power of 1/2. So, (2⁴)^(1/2) = 2² = 4, (3²)^(1/2) = 3, and (5²)^(1/2) = 5. Multiply those together: 4×3×5.
4×3 is 12, 12×5 is 60.

Based on execution_2.2:
Then, the square root is 60. Either way, same answer. So, both methods confirm that the square root is 60.

Based on execution_2.3:
Yep, that's another way to verify.
So, regardless of the method—direct multiplication, prime factorization, or grouping—the result is 60.
