Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, there are 35 students in total at a math club meeting. The number of girls is a multiple of 13, and there are more girls than boys. We need to find out how many boys are at the meeting.

First, let me break down the information given.

<prompt_1.1> Break down the given information and identify the conditions for the number of girls and boys. </prompt_1.1>

The total number of students is 35. Girls are a multiple of 13, and girls are more than boys. So, the number of girls must be greater than the number of boys, and girls = multiple of 13. Since the total is 35, boys would be 35 minus the number of girls. Also, since there are more girls than boys, the number of girls must be more than half of 35. Half of 35 is 17.5, so girls must be at least 18. But girls have to be a multiple of 13.

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Let me list the multiples of 13.

<prompt_2.1> List the multiples of 13 and identify those that are possible numbers of girls. </prompt_2.1>
</Plan_2>

13, 26, 39, etc. But since the total number of students is 35, the number of girls can't exceed 35. So possible multiples of 13 within 35 are 13 and 26. Because 39 is more than 35, which isn't possible.

</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Now, since there are more girls than boys, the number of girls must be greater than 17.5, as I thought earlier. So let's check the possible multiples.

<prompt_3.1> Check the possible multiples of 13 to determine the number of girls and calculate the number of boys. </prompt_3.1>

Wait, but let me check if there's another way this could be approached. Maybe algebraically. Let's let G be the number of girls and B the number of boys. Then G + B = 35. We know G is a multiple of 13, so G = 13k where k is a positive integer. Also, G > B. Since B = 35 - G, then G > 35 - G. Let's solve that inequality.

<prompt_3.2> Use algebraic methods to solve the problem and verify the solution. </prompt_3.2>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
First, 13. If there are 13 girls, then boys would be 35 - 13 = 22. But 13 is less than 22, which contradicts the condition that there are more girls than boys. So 13 is too low. Next multiple is 26. If there are 26 girls, then boys are 35 - 26 = 9. 26 is greater than 9, which satisfies the condition. So 26 girls and 9 boys.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
G + G > 35
2G > 35
G > 17.5

So G must be greater than 17.5. Since G is a multiple of 13, possible G values are 13, 26. 13 is less than 17.5, so it's invalid. 26 is the next multiple, which is 26. Then boys would be 35 - 26 = 9.
</execution_3.2>
</Execution_3>

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
Wait, but let me double-check.
If girls are 26, boys are 9. 26 + 9 = 35, which matches the total. 26 is a multiple of 13 (13*2=26), and 26 > 9.

Is there any other possible multiple of 13 that I might have missed?

<prompt_4.1> Verify if any other multiples of 13 could be possible numbers of girls. </prompt_4.1>

Based on execution_3.2:
Another check: If there are 26 girls, then boys are 9. 26 girls is two-thirds of the club, and boys are one-third. That seems like a significant majority, but the problem doesn't set any other constraints, so as long as the numbers add up and meet the given conditions, it's valid.
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
Let's see, 13*1=13, 13*2=26, 13*3=39. 39 is over 35, so no. So only 13 and 26. 13 doesn't work because it leads to more boys than girls. 26 does.
</execution_4.1>
</Execution_4>

<Final_answer>
So, the number of boys at the meeting is $\boxed{9}$.
