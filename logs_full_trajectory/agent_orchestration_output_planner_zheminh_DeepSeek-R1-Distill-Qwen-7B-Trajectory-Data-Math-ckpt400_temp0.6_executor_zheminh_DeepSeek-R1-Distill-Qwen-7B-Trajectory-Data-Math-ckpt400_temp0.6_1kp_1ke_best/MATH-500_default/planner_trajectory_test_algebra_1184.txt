<Question>
In the sequence 0, 1, 1, 3, 6, 9, 27, ..., the first term is 0.   Subsequent terms are produced by alternately adding and  multiplying by each successive integer beginning with 1.  For  instance, the second term is produced by adding  1 to the first term; the third term is produced by  multiplying the second term by 1; the fourth term  is produced by adding 2 to the third term; and so  on.  What is the value of the first term that is greater than 125?

Okay, let's try to figure out this sequence problem. The sequence starts with 0, and then each subsequent term is produced by alternately adding and multiplying by each successive integer starting from 1. The example given is the second term is 1 (0 + 1), the third term is 1 (1 * 1), the fourth term is 3 (1 + 2), and so on. The question is asking for the first term in this sequence that's greater than 125.

First, I need to make sure I understand the pattern correctly.
Let's break down the given terms:

Term 1: 0

Term 2: Term1 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1

Term 3: Term2 * 1 = 1 * 1 = 1

Term 4: Term3 + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3

Term 5: Term4 * 2 = 3 * 2 = 6

Term 6: Term5 + 3 = 6 + 3 = 9

Term 7: Term6 * 3 = 9 * 3 = 27

Term 8: Term7 + 4 = 27 + 4 = 31

Term 9: Term8 * 4 = 31 * 4 = 124

Term 10: Term9 + 5 = 124 + 5 = 129
So the first term greater than 125 is 129.

But let me verify step by step to ensure I didn't make a mistake.

Starting from term 1:

<prompt_1.1> Verify the sequence step by step starting from term 1 to term 10. </prompt_1.1>

But wait, let me check the operations again. The problem states: "alternately adding and multiplying by each successive integer beginning with 1".

<prompt_1.2> Re-evaluate the operations and confirm the sequence pattern. </prompt_1.2>

Another way to look at it: operations alternate between add and multiply, starting with add for the second term.

<prompt_1.3> Confirm the operations and sequence using an alternative perspective. </prompt_1.3>

But let me just check once more for errors. Maybe miscalculating term 9 or 10.

<prompt_1.4> Re-verify the calculations for terms 1 to 10. </prompt_1.4>

<execution_1.1>
1. Term 1: 0 (given)
2. Term 2: Term1 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1
3. Term 3: Term2 * 1 = 1 * 1 = 1
4. Term 4: Term3 + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3
5. Term 5: Term4 * 2 = 3 * 2 = 6
6. Term 6: Term5 + 3 = 6 + 3 = 9
7. Term 7: Term6 * 3 = 9 * 3 = 27
8. Term 8: Term7 + 4 = 27 + 4 = 31
9. Term 9: Term8 * 4 = 31 * 4 = 124
10. Term 10: Term9 + 5 = 124 + 5 = 129
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
So starting from term1 (0), to get term2, we add 1. Then term3 is term2 multiplied by 2? Wait, hold on, the problem says "beginning with 1". Hmm. Wait, the example says: "the second term is produced by adding 1 to the first term; the third term is produced by multiplying the second term by 1; the fourth term is produced by adding 2 to the third term; and so on." 

Wait, so the operations alternate between addition and multiplication, starting with addition for the second term. Then multiplication for the third term, addition for the fourth, multiplication for the fifth, etc. But the integers used for addition and multiplication start at 1 and increase by 1 each time. So the sequence of operations is: add 1, multiply by 1, add 2, multiply by 2, add 3, multiply by 3, etc. But wait, multiplying by 1 doesn't change the number. That might be a point of confusion.

Given that, let's reconstruct the sequence step by step:

Term 1: 0

Term 2: Term1 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1

Term 3: Term2 * 1 = 1 * 1 = 1

Term 4: Term3 + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3

Term 5: Term4 * 2 = 3 * 2 = 6

Term 6: Term5 + 3 = 6 + 3 = 9

Term 7: Term6 * 3 = 9 * 3 = 27

Term 8: Term7 + 4 = 27 + 4 = 31

Term 9: Term8 * 4 = 31 * 4 = 124

Term 10: Term9 + 5 = 124 + 5 = 129
</execution_1.2>

<execution_1.3>
So starting from term 1 (0), to get term 2, we add 1. Then term 3 is term2 multiplied by 1 (since next integer is 1, and the operation alternates). Then term4 is term3 plus 2 (integer 2), term5 is term4 multiplied by 2, term6 is term5 plus 3, term7 is term6 multiplied by 3, term8 is term7 plus 4, term9 is term8 multiplied by 4, term10 is term9 plus 5. That seems to be the pattern. So operations alternate between add and multiply, starting with add for the second term. Each operation uses the next integer in sequence (1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5...). Wait, actually, the integers are 1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5... So each integer n is used twice: once for addition and once for multiplication. For example, 1 is used in term2 (add) and term3 (multiply), 2 is used in term4 (add) and term5 (multiply), 3 in term6 (add) and term7 (multiply), 4 in term8 (add) and term9 (multiply), 5 in term10 (add) and term11 (multiply), etc.

<execution_1.4>
Term 9: 31 * 4. 31*4 is 124, correct. Then term10: 124 +5=129. Yes. So 129 is the first term over 125.
</execution_1.4>
</Execution_1>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1, execution_1.2, execution_1.3, execution_1.4:
Therefore, the answer is 129.
I think that's correct.

<Execution_2>
No prompt to execute.
</Execution_2>

<Final_answer>
Therefore, the first term in the sequence that is greater than 125 is $\boxed{129}$.
