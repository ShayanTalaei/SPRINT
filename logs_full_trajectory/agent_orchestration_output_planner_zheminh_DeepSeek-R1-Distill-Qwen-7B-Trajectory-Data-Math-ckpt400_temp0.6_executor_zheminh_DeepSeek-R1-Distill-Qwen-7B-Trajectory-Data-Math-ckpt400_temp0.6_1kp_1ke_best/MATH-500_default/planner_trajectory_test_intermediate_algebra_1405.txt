</Question>

<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to find the side length of an equilateral triangle inscribed in the parabola x² = 8y, with one vertex at the parabola's vertex, which is the origin (0,0). Hmm, let's start by visualizing this. The parabola opens upwards, and the equilateral triangle has one vertex at the origin. The other two vertices must lie somewhere on the parabola. Since it's an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal, and all angles are 60 degrees.

First, let me recall that in an equilateral triangle, the height h is related to the side length s by h = (√3/2)s. Maybe this relationship will come in handy.

<prompt_1.1> Recall the relationship between the side length and height of an equilateral triangle. </prompt_1.1>

But how do I relate this to the parabola?

Let me consider the coordinates of the other two vertices.

<prompt_1.2> Consider the coordinates of the other two vertices of the equilateral triangle. </prompt_1.2>

Wait, but let me verify this. Let's see.

<prompt_1.3> Verify the solution by checking the distances between the points. </prompt_1.3>

But let me check if there's another possible configuration. For example, maybe the triangle is not symmetric about the y-axis. Suppose the other two vertices are not symmetric.

<prompt_1.4> Consider if there could be another configuration of the triangle. </prompt_1.4>

<execution_1.1>
Since the triangle is inscribed in the parabola, the other two vertices must satisfy the equation x² = 8y. Let me denote the three vertices as (0,0), (a, a²/8), and (b, b²/8). But since it's an equilateral triangle, the distances between each pair of points must be equal.
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
Since the parabola is symmetric about the y-axis, maybe the triangle is symmetric with respect to the y-axis as well. That would mean the other two vertices are mirror images across the y-axis. So, if one vertex is at (a, b), the other would be at (-a, b). Then, the three vertices of the triangle would be (0,0), (a, b), and (-a, b).
</execution_1.2>

<execution_1.3>
If the triangle has vertices at (0,0), (a, a²/8), and (-a, a²/8), then the distance from (0,0) to (a, a²/8) should be equal to the distance from (0,0) to (-a, a²/8), which is obviously true, and also equal to the distance between (a, a²/8) and (-a, a²/8). 

Calculating the distance between (a, a²/8) and (-a, a²/8) is straightforward: it's 2a. The distance from (0,0) to (a, a²/8) is sqrt(a² + (a²/8)^2). Setting this equal to 2a gives sqrt(a² + a^4/64) = 2a. Squaring both sides: a² + a^4/64 = 4a². Subtract a²: a^4/64 = 3a². Divide both sides by a² (assuming a ≠ 0): a²/64 = 3. So a² = 192, a = sqrt(192) = 8√3. Then the side length would be 2a = 16√3. Wait, but hold on. If the distance between (a, a²/8) and (-a, a²/8) is 2a, and we set that equal to the distance from (0,0) to (a, a²/8), which is sqrt(a² + (a²/8)^2). So solving sqrt(a² + (a^4)/64) = 2a. Then squaring gives a² + a^4/64 = 4a². Then a^4/64 = 3a². Then a^4 = 192a². Then a² = 192, so a = sqrt(192) = 8√3. Therefore, 2a = 16√3. So the side length is 16√3.
</execution_1.3>

<execution_1.4>
But in that case, would the triangle still be equilateral? Let's think. If one vertex is at (0,0), and the other two are somewhere else on the parabola, but not symmetric. However, due to the symmetry of the parabola, maybe the only possible equilateral triangle is the symmetric one. Because if you have two points on the parabola not symmetric with respect to the y-axis, then the distances from (0,0) to each of them might not be equal, and the distance between them might not equal the other sides. Hmm, perhaps the symmetry is required.

Based on execution_1.2:
Let me write that down.

<prompt_2.1> Set up equations for the distances between the points of the triangle. </prompt_2.1>
-----

Based on execution_1.3:
Then the height is 8√3 * (√3/2) = 12.
But the y-coordinate of the other vertices is a²/8. If a = 8√3, then a² = (64*3) = 192, so a²/8 = 24. So the other vertices are at (8√3, 24). Then the height of the triangle is 24, since the base is from y=0 to y=24, so height is 24. Then the side length should be (24)*(2/√3) = 48/√3 = 16√3. Which matches.

Based on execution_1.4:
Let me test this assumption.

Suppose the other two vertices are (a, a²/8) and (b, b²/8).

<prompt_2.2> Test the assumption of symmetry by setting up equations for a non-symmetric triangle. </prompt_2.2>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Let’s denote the other two vertices as (a, a²/8) and (-a, a²/8) because of symmetry. Then, the sides are:

1. From (0,0) to (a, a²/8): distance is sqrt[(a - 0)^2 + (a²/8 - 0)^2] = sqrt(a² + a^4/64)
2. From (0,0) to (-a, a²/8): same as above, sqrt(a² + a^4/64)
3. From (a, a²/8) to (-a, a²/8): distance is sqrt[( -a - a)^2 + (a²/8 - a²/8)^2] = sqrt[(-2a)^2 + 0] = sqrt[4a²] = 2a

Since it's an equilateral triangle, all sides must be equal. Therefore, sqrt(a² + a^4/64) = 2a.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Then the distances between (0,0) and (a, a²/8), (0,0) and (b, b²/8), and (a, a²/8) and (b, b²/8) must all be equal.

So, distance from (0,0) to (a, a²/8) is sqrt(a² + (a²/8)^2) = sqrt(a² + a^4/64).

Similarly for b. So sqrt(b² + b^4/64).

And the distance between (a, a²/8) and (b, b²/8) is sqrt((a - b)^2 + (a²/8 - b²/8)^2).

So setting all three distances equal:

sqrt(a² + a^4/64) = sqrt(b² + b^4/64) = sqrt((a - b)^2 + (a²/8 - b²/8)^2)

Based on execution_2.1:
Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

<prompt_3.1> Solve the equation obtained from setting the distances equal to find the side length. </prompt_3.1>

Based on execution_2.2:
This seems more complicated, but maybe there's a solution where a ≠ -b. Let me see.

<prompt_3.2> Analyze the possibility of a non-symmetric solution by setting a = b. </prompt_3.2>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
a² + a^4/64 = (2a)^2
a² + a^4/64 = 4a²

Subtract a² from both sides:

a^4/64 = 3a²

Multiply both sides by 64:

a^4 = 192a²

Divide both sides by a² (assuming a ≠ 0):

a² = 192

So, a = sqrt(192) or a = -sqrt(192). Since we're dealing with coordinates, a can be positive or negative, but since we took a and -a for the other vertex, the magnitude is sqrt(192). Simplify sqrt(192):

sqrt(192) = sqrt(64*3) = 8*sqrt(3)

So, a = 8√3. Therefore, the distance between (a, a²/8) and (-a, a²/8) is 2a = 16√3. So the side length of the triangle is 16√3.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
If a ≠ -b, but maybe a = b? Wait, if a = b, then the two points would coincide, which isn't possible. So a ≠ b. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe a = -b, which would give the symmetric case. So perhaps the only solution is the symmetric one.
</execution_3.2>
</Execution_3>

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
Wait, but let me check if this is correct.
If a = 8√3, then the y-coordinate of the other vertices is (a²)/8 = (192)/8 = 24. So the points are (8√3, 24) and (-8√3, 24). Then, the distance from (0,0) to (8√3, 24) is sqrt[(8√3)^2 + 24^2] = sqrt(192 + 576) = sqrt(768) = sqrt(256*3) = 16√3. The distance between (8√3, 24) and (-8√3, 24) is 16√3 as well, since it's 2*8√3 = 16√3. So yes, all sides are equal.

Let me check.

Suppose a ≠ -b.

<execution_4.1>
Let me denote the two points as (a, a²/8) and (b, b²/8). Then, we have:

sqrt(a² + (a²/8)^2) = sqrt(b² + (b²/8)^2) => a² + a^4/64 = b² + b^4/64. Let's call this equation (1).

Also, the distance between (a, a²/8) and (b, b²/8) must equal sqrt(a² + (a²/8)^2). Let's compute that distance squared:

(a - b)^2 + (a²/8 - b²/8)^2 = (a² + (a²/8)^2) - (b² + (b²/8)^2) + (b² + (b²/8)^2) - (a² + (a²/8)^2) ? Wait, maybe better to expand directly.

Distance squared between (a, a²/8) and (b, b²/8) is (a - b)^2 + ( (a² - b²)/8 )^2.

Set this equal to a² + (a^4)/64.

So:

(a - b)^2 + ( (a² - b²)/8 )^2 = a² + a^4/64.

Let me expand the left side:

(a - b)^2 = a² - 2ab + b²

( (a² - b²)/8 )^2 = (a² - b²)^2 / 64 = (a^4 - 2a²b² + b^4)/64

So total left side:

a² - 2ab + b² + (a^4 - 2a²b² + b^4)/64

Set equal to right side:

a² + a^4/64

Subtract right side from both sides:

-2ab + b² + (a^4 - 2a²b² + b^4)/64 - a^4/64 = 0

Simplify:

-2ab + b² + (-2a²b² + b^4)/64 = 0

Multiply both sides by 64 to eliminate denominator:

-128ab + 64b² - 2a²b² + b^4 = 0

Hmm, this seems complicated. Let's see if we can factor anything out. Let's factor out a b:

b(-128a + 64b - 2a²b + b^3) = 0

Since b ≠ 0 (otherwise, we'd have the trivial case where two points coincide at the vertex), we can divide both sides by b:

-128a + 64b - 2a²b + b^3 = 0

This is a complicated equation. Let's recall from equation (1):

a² + a^4/64 = b² + b^4/64

Multiply both sides by 64:

64a² + a^4 = 64b² + b^4

Rearrange:

a^4 - b^4 + 64a² - 64b² = 0

Factor:

(a² - b²)(a² + b²) + 64(a² - b²) = 0

Factor out (a² - b²):

(a² - b²)(a² + b² + 64) = 0

So either a² = b², which would mean a = ±b. But if a = b, the two points coincide, which isn't allowed. If a = -b, then we have the symmetric case we considered earlier. So the only possibility here is a = -b. Therefore, the non-symmetric case doesn't yield a solution, and the only solution is when a = -b.

The distance from (0,0) to (8√3, 24) is sqrt( (8√3)^2 + 24^2 ) = sqrt( 192 + 576 ) = sqrt(768) = 16√3. The distance between (8√3, 24) and (-8√3, 24) is sqrt( (16√3)^2 + 0 ) = 16√3. So yes, all sides are equal. The triangle is equilateral.
