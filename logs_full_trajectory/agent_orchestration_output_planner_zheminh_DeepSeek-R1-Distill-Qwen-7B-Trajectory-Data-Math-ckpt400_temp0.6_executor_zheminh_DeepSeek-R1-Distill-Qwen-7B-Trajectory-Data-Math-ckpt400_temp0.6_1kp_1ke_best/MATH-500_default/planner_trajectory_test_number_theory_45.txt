Okay, so I need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 6432 and 132, and then add 11 to it. Hmm, let me start by recalling how to find the GCF of two numbers. The most reliable method I know is the Euclidean algorithm. Let me make sure I remember that correctly. The GCF of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. The Euclidean algorithm uses division to find this by repeatedly applying the division algorithm and replacing the larger number with the remainder until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCF.

First, let me confirm the two numbers: 6432 and 132. I need to find GCF(6432, 132).

Let me start the Euclidean algorithm step by step.

Alternatively, maybe I can verify using prime factorization. Let's try that method to cross-check.

So, divide 6432 by 132. Let me compute that. 132 times 48 is 6336, because 132*50 is 6600, which is 6600 - 132*2 = 6600 - 264 = 6336. Then 6432 - 6336 is 96. So the remainder is 96. So now, GCF(6432, 132) is GCF(132, 96).

Next step: divide 132 by 96. 96*1 is 96, subtract that from 132, remainder is 36. So now, GCF(132, 96) is GCF(96, 36).

Then, divide 96 by 36. 36*2 is 72. Subtract that from 96, remainder is 24. So GCF(96, 36) becomes GCF(36, 24).

Divide 36 by 24. 24*1 is 24, remainder is 12. So GCF(36, 24) is GCF(24, 12).

Finally, divide 24 by 12. 12*2 is 24, remainder is 0. So the GCF is 12.

Prime factors of 132: 

132 divided by 2 is 66. 
66 divided by 2 is 33. 
33 divided by 3 is 11. 
11 is a prime. 

So, prime factors of 132 are 2^2 * 3^1 * 11^1.

Now, prime factors of 6432. Let's do that step by step.

6432 divided by 2 is 3216. 
3216 divided by 2 is 1608. 
1608 divided by 2 is 804. 
804 divided by 2 is 402. 
402 divided by 2 is 201. 
201 divided by 3 is 67. 
67 is a prime. 

So, prime factors of 6432 are 2^5 * 3^1 * 67^1.

Now, the GCF is the product of the lowest powers of the common primes. The common primes between 6432 and 132 are 2 and 3.

For prime 2: the lowest power is 2^2 (since 2^2 in 132 and 2^5 in 6432).
For prime 3: the lowest power is 3^1 (common in both).
Prime 11 is only in 132, and 67 is only in 6432, so they don't contribute.

Therefore, GCF = 2^2 * 3^1 = 4 * 3 = 12.

Based on execution_1.1:
Wait, let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.

First division: 6432 ÷ 132. Let me check 132*48. 132*40 is 5280, 132*8 is 1056. 5280 + 1056 = 6336. Then 6432 - 6336 = 96. Correct. So remainder 96.

Next, 132 ÷ 96. 96*1 = 96, remainder 36. Correct.

96 ÷ 36. 36*2 = 72, remainder 24. Correct.

36 ÷ 24. 24*1 = 24, remainder 12. Correct.

24 ÷ 12. 12*2 = 24, remainder 0. So GCF is 12.

<Final_answer>
Therefore, when the greatest common factor of 6432 and 132 is increased by 11, the result is $\boxed{12}$.
