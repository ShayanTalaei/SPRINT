Okay, so I need to compute the value of this expression: 1 over cosine squared 10 degrees plus 1 over sine squared 20 degrees plus 1 over sine squared 40 degrees. Hmm, let me write that down again to make sure I have it right: 1/(cos²10°) + 1/(sin²20°) + 1/(sin²40°). Alright, that's the one.

First, I remember that 1 over cosine squared theta is the same as secant squared theta, and 1 over sine squared theta is cosecant squared theta. But I don't know if that helps here. Maybe there's a trigonometric identity that can simplify these terms.

Let me think. I know that 1 + tan²theta = sec²theta, so maybe that's useful for the first term. For the second and third terms, since they are cosecant squared, and I know that 1 + cot²theta = csc²theta. So perhaps converting them into tan and cot functions?

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to express all terms in terms of sine or cosine of the same angle? Let's see.

Looking at the angles: 10°, 20°, 40°. These are all multiples of 10°, which might be helpful. Maybe there's a relationship between these angles?

<prompt_1.1> Analyze the given angles and identify any relationships or identities that could simplify the expression. </prompt_1.1>

Let me try converting each term using the identities I mentioned.

<prompt_1.2> Convert the trigonometric terms using the identities 1 + tan²theta = sec²theta and 1 + cot²theta = csc²theta. </prompt_1.2>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
For example, 20° is twice 10°, and 40° is four times 10°. Maybe using double-angle or multiple-angle identities?

Wait, 40° is 2 times 20°, so maybe that's a clue. Let me check.
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
Starting with the first term: 1/(cos²10°) = 1 + tan²10°. So that's sec²10° = 1 + tan²10°. Okay, so the first term can be written as 1 + tan²10°.

For the second term: 1/(sin²20°) = 1 + cot²20°, which is csc²20°. Similarly, the third term is csc²40°, which is 1 + cot²40°. So substituting these in, the entire expression becomes:

(1 + tan²10°) + (1 + cot²20°) + (1 + cot²40°) = 3 + tan²10° + cot²20° + cot²40°.

Hmm, so now the problem reduces to computing tan²10° + cot²20° + cot²40° and adding 3 to it. Maybe this is easier? Let's see.

Based on execution_1.1, execution_1.2:
Let me compute each of these terms numerically first to get an approximate value, maybe that can help me check if I'm on the right track.

<prompt_2.1> Compute the approximate values of the trigonometric terms using a calculator. </prompt_2.1>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Calculating 1/cos²10°: cos10° is approximately 0.9848, so squared is about 0.9698, reciprocal is approximately 1.031. Then 1/sin²20°: sin20° is about 0.3420, squared is 0.11699, reciprocal is approximately 8.552. Similarly, 1/sin²40°: sin40° is about 0.6428, squared is 0.4132, reciprocal is approximately 2.421. Adding these up: 1.031 + 8.552 + 2.421 ≈ 12.004. Hmm, that's approximately 12. So maybe the exact value is 12?

Wait, that's interesting. So the sum is about 12.
</execution_2.1>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Let me check with more accurate calculations.

<prompt_3.1> Recompute the approximate values with more accurate calculations. </prompt_3.1>

But let's see if there's a way to get to 12 exactly.

So the original expression is equal to 3 + tan²10° + cot²20° + cot²40°. If we can show that tan²10° + cot²20° + cot²40° = 9, then the total would be 12.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to relate these angles through trigonometric identities.

Let me note that 10°, 20°, 40° are all related by doubling angles: 10°, 2*10°=20°, 4*10°=40°. Maybe there's a multiple-angle formula or a recursive identity that can be applied here.

Alternatively, perhaps using the identity for tangent of multiple angles.

<prompt_3.2> Explore the use of trigonometric identities, particularly multiple-angle identities, to simplify the expression. </prompt_3.2>

Alternatively, maybe using product-to-sum formulas? Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps considering complex numbers or other representations, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, maybe considering the original expression in terms of sine and cosine of the same angles.

Wait, 10°, 20°, 40°. Let me note that 10° is half of 20°, and 20° is half of 40°. So maybe using half-angle identities? But the half-angle identities involve square roots, which might not help here.

Alternatively, perhaps using the identity that relates tan theta and cot(90° - theta). But 20° and 70°, but we have 40°, which is complementary to 50°, not sure.

Alternatively, let's consider the following approach: express all terms in terms of sin and cos of 10°, 20°, 40°, and see if there's a relationship.

<prompt_3.3> Express all terms in the expression in terms of sin and cos of 10°, 20°, and 40°. </prompt_3.3>
-----

But maybe there's a different approach. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps using the identity that for any angle theta, 1 + tan²theta = sec²theta, and 1 + cot²theta = csc²theta. But we already used that. Alternatively, maybe using the identity that relates tan theta and cot(theta/2) or something like that.

<prompt_3.4> Explore alternative trigonometric identities and relationships to simplify the expression. </prompt_3.4>

Alternatively, maybe there's a telescoping series or some symmetry here.

Alternatively, let me check with another approach.

<prompt_3.5> Verify the result using another approach involving product-to-sum identities. </prompt_3.5>

Alternatively, let's check for calculation errors.

Wait, but let me check another way. Let's compute each term exactly.

<prompt_3.6> Verify the result by computing each term exactly and summing them up. </prompt_3.6>

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to express this sum as a combination of angles. Let me think.

<prompt_3.7> Explore the use of complementary angles and other identities to simplify the expression. </prompt_3.7>

Alternatively, maybe using the identity for tan(3 theta). For example, 3*10°=30°, which is a standard angle.

<prompt_3.8> Explore the use of the identity for tan(3 theta) to simplify the expression. </prompt_3.8>

Alternatively, maybe another identity. Let's see.

<prompt_3.9> Explore the use of product-to-sum identities to verify the result. </prompt_3.9>

But just to be thorough, let me check once more. Let's think of another way.

<prompt_3.10> Verify the result using multiple approaches and ensure the final answer is correct. </prompt_3.10>

<execution_3.1>
Using calculator for higher precision:

cos10°: cos(10°) ≈ 0.984807753012208, so squared is ≈ 0.969846310392954, reciprocal is ≈ 1.031421263432698.

sin20°: sin(20°) ≈ 0.342020143300091, squared is ≈ 0.116977778438028, reciprocal is ≈ 8.552030740419675.

sin40°: sin(40°) ≈ 0.642787609686539, squared is ≈ 0.413175911148336, reciprocal is ≈ 2.420327816167675.

Adding them up: 1.031421263432698 + 8.552030740419675 + 2.420327816167675 ≈ 12.0038. Hmm, so approximately 12.0038, which is very close to 12. So maybe the exact value is 12.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
Wait, 40° is 4 times 10°, but maybe not. Alternatively, 20° is 2 times 10°, and 40° is 2 times 20°, so maybe using double-angle formulas.

For example, sin40° is 2 sin20° cos20°, from the double-angle identity: sin2 theta = 2 sin theta cos theta. So sin40° = 2 sin20° cos20°. Therefore, 1/sin²40° = 1/(4 sin²20° cos²20°). Hmm, but that might complicate things.
</execution_3.2>

<execution_3.3>
Wait, the first term is 1/cos²10°, which is sec²10°. The second term is csc²20°, and the third term is csc²40°. Maybe there's a relationship between these angles? 10°, 20°, 40°. 10° is half of 20°, 20° is half of 40°, but I don't see an immediate connection.
</execution_3.3>

<execution_3.4>
Alternatively, perhaps using the identity that relates tan(20°) and tan(40°). Wait, 40° is 2*20°, so maybe using double-angle formulas.

For example, tan(40°) = tan(2*20°) = 2 tan20° / (1 - tan²20°). Maybe that can relate tan40° and tan20°. Similarly, tan20° can be related to tan10° via tan(2*10°). Let's explore that.

Let me denote t = tan10°. Then tan20° = 2t/(1 - t²). Then tan40° = 2*(2t/(1 - t²)) / (1 - (2t/(1 - t²))²). That seems complicated, but maybe we can express cot²20° and cot²40° in terms of t and see if tan²10° + cot²20° + cot²40° simplifies.
</execution_3.4>

<execution_3.5>
Let's consider the terms tan²10°, cot²20°, cot²40°. Let me note that 10°, 20°, 40° are in a geometric progression with ratio 2. Maybe there's a product formula here? Alternatively, maybe consider that 40° is twice 20°, so perhaps using the double-angle formula for cotangent.

Recall that cot(2 theta) = (1 - tan²theta)/(2 tan theta). So if we let theta = 20°, then cot(40°) = (1 - tan²20°)/(2 tan20°). But we have cot²40°, so maybe squaring both sides: cot²40° = [(1 - tan²20°)/(2 tan20°)]². Hmm, not sure if that helps directly.

Alternatively, maybe express cot²40° in terms of tan20°. Let's see: cot40° = tan50°, since cot theta = tan(90° - theta). So cot40° = tan50°, so cot²40° = tan²50°. So then, our expression becomes tan²10° + cot²20° + tan²50°. Hmm, maybe that's helpful?

Alternatively, perhaps considering that 50° is 60° - 10°, but not sure.

Alternatively, maybe use the identity tan(A) + tan(B) + tan(C) = tan(A)tan(B)tan(C) for A + B + C = 180°, but here angles are 10°,20°,50°, which sum to 80°, so that identity doesn't apply.
</execution_3.5>

<execution_3.6>
Let's compute each term symbolically. Let's see.

First term: 1/cos²10°. Let's keep it as is for now.

Second term: 1/sin²20°. Let's note that sin20° = 2 sin10° cos10°, from the double-angle formula: sin2 theta = 2 sin theta cos theta. So sin20° = 2 sin10° cos10°, so sin²20° = 4 sin²10° cos²10°, so 1/sin²20° = 1/(4 sin²10° cos²10°). Hmm, maybe that's helpful?

Third term: 1/sin²40°. Similarly, sin40° = 2 sin20° cos20°, so sin²40° = 4 sin²20° cos²20°, so 1/sin²40° = 1/(4 sin²20° cos²20°). But sin20° is 2 sin10° cos10°, so substituting that in, sin²20° = 4 sin²10° cos²10°, so 1/sin²40° = 1/(4*(4 sin²10° cos²10°)*cos²20°) ) = 1/(16 sin²10° cos²10° cos²20°). Hmm, this seems to be getting more complicated. Maybe this approach isn't the best.

Alternatively, perhaps using product-to-sum formulas on the denominators. Let's see.

Alternatively, maybe considering the original expression in terms of sine and cosine:

1/(cos²10°) + 1/(sin²20°) + 1/(sin²40°) = sec²10° + csc²20° + csc²40°. Let's recall that sec²theta = 1 + tan²theta, and csc²theta = 1 + cot²theta. So as before, this gives 1 + tan²10° + 1 + cot²20° + 1 + cot²40° = 3 + tan²10° + cot²20° + cot²40°. So if we can compute tan²10° + cot²20° + cot²40°, then add 3.

Alternatively, perhaps using the identity tan theta = sin theta / cos theta, so tan²10° = sin²10° / cos²10°. Similarly, cot²20° = cos²20° / sin²20°, cot²40° = cos²40° / sin²40°. So perhaps combining these fractions?

Alternatively, maybe express all terms in terms of sin10°, cos10°, sin20°, cos20°, sin40°, cos40°, but I don't see an immediate simplification.
</execution_3.6>

<execution_3.7>
Wait, 10°, 20°, 40°, these are not complementary angles, but perhaps there's a relationship. For example, 10° and 80° are complementary, but 80° isn't in the expression. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps using the identity that relates tan theta and cot(40° - theta). Wait, 40° - 10° = 30°, but not sure.
</execution_3.7>

<execution_3.8>
But 10°, 20°, 40°, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using the identity for tan(A) + tan(B) + tan(C) when A + B + C = 180°, but here the angles are 10°, 20°, 40°, which sum to 70°, so that doesn't apply.
</execution_3.8>

<execution_3.9>
Alternatively, perhaps using the identity for tan(A) + tan(B) + tan(C) when A + B + C = 180°, but that might not apply here.

Alternatively, perhaps considering that 10°, 20°, 40° are in a geometric progression? 10°, 20°, 40°, each term multiplied by 2. Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe using the identity for tan(2theta) = 2 tan theta / (1 - tan²theta). Let's see. For example, tan20° = tan(2*10°) = 2 tan10° / (1 - tan²10°). Similarly, tan40° = tan(2*20°) = 2 tan20° / (1 - tan²20°). Maybe there's a way to express tan20° and tan40° in terms of tan10°, but I'm not sure if that helps with the cotangent squared terms.

Alternatively, maybe express cot²20° and cot²40° in terms of tan. Since cot theta = tan(90° - theta), so cot20° = tan70°, and cot40° = tan50°. So the expression becomes tan²10° + tan²70° + tan²50°. Wait, that's interesting. So 1/(cos²10°) + 1/(sin²20°) + 1/(sin²40°) = tan²10° + tan²70° + tan²50°. Hmm, maybe this is a known identity?

Alternatively, perhaps using the identity that tan²theta = sec²theta - 1. Wait, but that's what we already used. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe considering that 10°, 50°, 70° are related. For example, 10° + 50° = 60°, and 50° + 70° = 120°, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using the identity that tan A + tan B + tan C = tan A tan B tan C when A + B + C = 180°, but in this case, 10° + 50° + 70° = 130°, which is not 180°, so that identity doesn't apply here.

Alternatively, maybe using the identity for tan(50°) and tan(70°). Let's see. Alternatively, maybe expressing tan70° and tan50° in terms of tan10°, but that might be complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that tan50° = tan(60° - 10°), and tan70° = tan(60° + 10°). Let me compute those.

Using tan(A + B) and tan(A - B) formulas.

<execution_3.10>
Alternatively, let's use the identity that for any angle theta, tan^2(theta) = sec^2(theta) - 1. But we already used that. Alternatively, maybe using product-to-sum formulas on the terms.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that 10°, 20°, 40° are in a geometric progression, but I don't know if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps considering that 40° is 2*20°, so maybe using double-angle formulas for cotangent.

Wait, cot(2 theta) = (1 - tan²theta)/(2 tan theta). Hmm, but we have cot²40°, which is cot²(2*20°). Let me compute cot(40°) in terms of cot(20°). Let's see:

cot(40°) = cot(2*20°) = (1 - tan²20°)/(2 tan20°). Therefore, cot²40° = [(1 - tan²20°)/(2 tan20°)]². Hmm, but this might complicate things. Let's try substituting back into the expression tan²10° + cot²20° + cot²40°.

Alternatively, let's denote x = 10°, so that 20° = 2x, 40° = 4x. Then the expression becomes tan²x + cot²2x + cot²4x. So we need to compute tan²x + cot²2x + cot²4x. Maybe this substitution can help.

Let me write it in terms of x:

tan²x + cot²2x + cot²4x.

Express cot²2x in terms of tanx. Since cot2x = 1/(tan2x) = (1 - tan²x)/(2 tanx). Therefore, cot²2x = (1 - tan²x)^2/(4 tan²x).

Similarly, cot4x can be expressed in terms of tan2x. Let's see:

cot4x = 1/tan4x. And tan4x = 2 tan2x / (1 - tan²2x). But tan2x = 2 tanx / (1 - tan²x). Therefore, tan4x = 2*(2 tanx / (1 - tan²x)) / (1 - (2 tanx / (1 - tan²x))²). This is getting complicated, but let's try.

Let me denote t = tanx. Then tan2x = 2t/(1 - t²). Then tan4x = 2 tan2x / (1 - tan²2x) = 2*(2t/(1 - t²)) / (1 - (4t²)/(1 - t²)^2) = (4t/(1 - t²)) / [ ( (1 - t²)^2 - 4t² ) / (1 - t²)^2 ) ] = (4t/(1 - t²)) * ( (1 - t²)^2 ) / (1 - 2t² + t^4 - 4t² ) = 4t(1 - t²) / (1 - 6t² + t^4).

Therefore, cot4x = 1/tan4x = (1 - 6t² + t^4)/(4t(1 - t²)).

Therefore, cot²4x = [ (1 - 6t² + t^4)^2 ] / [ 16t²(1 - t²)^2 ].

This seems very complicated, but let's proceed.

So the expression tan²x + cot²2x + cot²4x in terms of t is:

t² + [ (1 - t²)^2 / (4t²) ] + [ (1 - 6t² + t^4)^2 / (16t²(1 - t²)^2) ].

This is getting very algebra intensive. Let's see if we can compute this.

But perhaps this approach is too cumbersome. Maybe there's a smarter substitution or identity that can be used here.

Alternatively, perhaps using the identity for tan(theta) in terms of sin(theta) and cos(theta). Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe considering that 10°, 20°, 40° are related through angle addition formulas. For example, 40° = 20° + 20°, but I don't know if that helps directly.

Alternatively, perhaps using the identity that relates tan(theta) and cot(theta/2). Wait, there is an identity that cot(theta/2) = 1 + cos(theta)/sin(theta). But not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using the identity that cot(theta) = tan(90° - theta). So cot20° = tan70°, and cot40° = tan50°. So maybe rewriting the expression as tan²10° + tan²70° + tan²50°. Hmm, is that helpful? Let's see.

So tan²10° + tan²50° + tan²70°. Maybe there's a known identity for the sum of tangents squared of these angles. Let me recall that in a triangle, if angles sum to 180°, but these angles are 10°, 50°, 70°, which do sum to 130°, so not a triangle. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps using the identity that tan^2(theta) = sec^2(theta) - 1, so the sum becomes [sec^210° - 1] + [sec^250° - 1] + [sec^270° - 1] = sec^210° + sec^250° + sec^270° - 3. But we already had this earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps considering that 10°, 50°, 70° are related as 10°, 10° + 40°, 70°, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using the identity that sec^2(theta) = 1 + tan^2(theta), but that's circular.

Alternatively, perhaps considering that 50° is 40° + 10°, so maybe using tan(A + B) identity. Let's see:

tan(50°) = tan(40° + 10°) = [tan40° + tan10°] / [1 - tan40° tan10°]. But squaring this might not help directly. Let's compute tan50° in terms of tan40° and tan10°. But this seems messy.

Alternatively, perhaps considering that 70° is 60° + 10°, so tan70° = tan(60° + 10°). Similarly, tan70° = [tan60° + tan10°] / [1 - tan60° tan10°]. But again, not sure if this helps.

Alternatively, perhaps using the identity for sum of tangents squared. Wait, there's an identity that says that for any three angles A, B, C such that A + B + C = 180°, then tan²A + tan²B + tan²C = tan²A tan²B tan²C. But in our case, 10° + 50° + 70° = 130°, which is not 180°, so that identity doesn't apply here.

Alternatively, maybe considering that 10°, 50°, 70° are part of a different triangle. But 10° + 50° + 70° = 130°, so not a triangle.

Alternatively, perhaps using the identity for tan(3 theta). For example, 3*10°=30°, which is a known angle. Let's recall that tan3theta = (3 tantheta - tan³theta)/(1 - 3 tan²theta). So for theta=10°, tan30° = 1/√3 = (3 tan10° - tan³10°)/(1 - 3 tan²10°). Maybe this can help us express tan10° in terms of known values.

Let me denote t = tan10°. Then:

(3t - t³)/(1 - 3t²) = 1/√3.

Cross-multiplying:

√3(3t - t³) = 1 - 3t².

Bring all terms to one side:

√3(3t - t³) - 1 + 3t² = 0.

Let me expand this:

3√3 t - √3 t³ - 1 + 3t² = 0.

Rearranged:

-√3 t³ + 3t² + 3√3 t - 1 = 0.

Hmm, this is a cubic equation in t. Not sure if helpful here. Maybe not the way to go.

Alternatively, perhaps considering that 50° is 45° + 5°, but not sure. Alternatively, 50° is 30° + 20°, so tan50° = tan(30° + 20°). Let's compute that:

tan(30° + 20°) = [tan30° + tan20°] / [1 - tan30° tan20°]. But again, not sure if helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps using product-to-sum identities on the original expression. Let's see.

The original expression is 1/cos²10° + 1/sin²20° + 1/sin²40°. Let's write each term as sec²theta and csc²theta:

sec²10° + csc²20° + csc²40°.

Recall that sec²theta = 1 + tan²theta and csc²theta = 1 + cot²theta, but we already did that.

Alternatively, perhaps using the identity that sec²theta = 1 + tan²theta, so:

sec²10° + csc²20° + csc²40° = 1 + tan²10° + 1 + cot²20° + 1 + cot²40° = 3 + tan²10° + cot²20° + cot²40°, which is the same as before. So we need to compute tan²10° + cot²20° + cot²40°.

Alternatively, perhaps expressing all terms in terms of sine and cosine:

tan²10° = sin²10° / cos²10°,

cot²20° = cos²20° / sin²20°,

cot²40° = cos²40° / sin²40°.

So the sum is [sin²10° / cos²10°] + [cos²20° / sin²20°] + [cos²40° / sin²40°]. Maybe combining these fractions? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using the identity that sin(3theta) = 3 sintheta - 4 sin³theta. For theta=10°, sin30°=1/2=3 sin10° - 4 sin³10°. Let's write that:

sin30° = 1/2 = 3 sin10° - 4 sin³10°.

So 4 sin³10° - 3 sin10° + 1/2 = 0. Let me write this as:

8 sin³10° - 6 sin10° + 1 = 0. Multiplying both sides by 2.

But not sure if helpful here.

Alternatively, perhaps using the identity for cos3theta. For theta=10°, cos30°=√3/2=4 cos³10° - 3 cos10°. So:

4 cos³10° - 3 cos10° = √3/2.

But again, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps considering that 10°, 20°, 40° are related through double-angle formulas. For example, 20° is double 10°, and 40° is double 20°. So maybe using the double-angle formula for cosine:

cos2theta = 2 cos²theta - 1. So cos20° = 2 cos²10° - 1, and cos40° = 2 cos²20° - 1. But how does that help here?

Alternatively, perhaps expressing the original terms in terms of cos20° and cos40°.

Wait, the original expression is 1/cos²10° + 1/sin²20° + 1/sin²40°. Let's see:

1/cos²10° = sec²10° = 1 + tan²10°,

1/sin²20° = csc²20° = 1 + cot²20°,

1/sin²40° = csc²40° = 1 + cot²40°.

But as before, leading to 3 + tan²10° + cot²20° + cot²40°. If we can relate tan²10° to cot²40°, perhaps through complementary angles.

Wait, 10° and 80° are complementary, but 40° and 50° are complementary. Not sure.

Alternatively, note that 40° = 90° - 50°, so cot40° = tan50°. Similarly, 20° = 90° - 70°, so cot20° = tan70°. So cot²20° = tan²70°, cot²40° = tan²50°. So the sum tan²10° + tan²70° + tan²50°. Hmm, so we need to compute tan²10° + tan²50° + tan²70°. Let's see if there's an identity for the sum of tangents squared of these angles.

Alternatively, perhaps using the identity that tan(A) tan(60° - A) tan(60° + A) = tan3A. For example, if A=10°, then tan10° tan50° tan70° = tan30° = 1/√3. Let me verify this:

tan10° tan50° tan70° = tan10° tan(60° - 10°) tan(60° + 10°) = tan10° [tan60° - tan10°]/[1 + tan60° tan10°] [tan60° + tan10°]/[1 - tan60° tan10°]. Wait, that seems complicated, but the identity states that tanA tan(60° - A) tan(60° + A) = tan3A. So for A=10°, tan3A = tan30° = 1/√3. Therefore, tan10° tan50° tan70° = 1/√3. So that's an interesting identity.

But how does that help us here? Let's see. If we can relate the sum tan²10° + tan²50° + tan²70° to this product. Hmm, perhaps not directly. But maybe if we consider squaring the product or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the identity that for any three angles A, B, C such that A + B + C = 180°, tanA tanB + tanB tanC + tanC tanA = 1. But in our case, 10° + 50° + 70° = 130°, so that identity doesn't apply. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps using the identity that in any triangle, tanA + tanB + tanC = tanA tanB tanC, but again, angles don't sum to 180° here.

Alternatively, perhaps considering that 10°, 50°, 70° are part of a triangle? Wait, 10° + 50° + 70° = 130°, so not a triangle. Alternatively, maybe a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps using the identity that tan^2(theta) = sec^2(theta) - 1, so the sum is [sec^210° + sec^250° + sec^270°] - 3. But we already have this.

Alternatively, perhaps using the identity that sec^2(theta) = 1 + tan^2(theta), but that's redundant.

Alternatively, perhaps using the identity for sec^2(theta) in terms of multiple angles. Wait, for example, sec^2(theta) can be expressed as 1 + tan^2(theta), but again, we have already used that.

Alternatively, perhaps considering the identity that relates sec^2(theta) and sec^2(3theta). For example, 3*10°=30°, 3*50°=150°, 3*70°=210°, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using complex numbers or Euler's formula, but that might complicate things further.

Alternatively, perhaps considering that 10°, 50°, 70° are all related to 20°, which is 2*10°, 40° is 2*20°, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps considering that 70° = 40° + 30°, so maybe using tan addition formula. Let's see:

tan(40° + 30°) = [tan40° + tan30°] / [1 - tan40° tan30°]. But tan70° is equal to this, but how does that help? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using the identity that tan(A) + tan(B) + tan(C) = tan(A)tan(B)tan(C) for a triangle, but as before, not applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps considering that 10°, 50°, 70° are part of a different identity. Wait, perhaps using the identity for the sum of squares of tangents. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps using the identity that relates the sum of squares of sines or cosines. Wait, but here we have sum of squares of tangents.

Alternatively, perhaps considering that tan^2(theta) = (1 - cos2theta)/(1 + cos2theta). Let me recall that identity:

tan²(theta) = (1 - cos2theta)/(1 + cos2theta). Yes, that's a standard identity. So perhaps using this to rewrite each term.

So, tan²10° = (1 - cos20°)/(1 + cos20°),

tan²50° = (1 - cos100°)/(1 + cos100°),

tan²70° = (1 - cos140°)/(1 + cos140°).

Therefore, the sum tan²10° + tan²50° + tan²70° becomes:

[(1 - cos20°)/(1 + cos20°)] + [(1 - cos100°)/(1 + cos100°)] + [(1 - cos140°)/(1 + cos140°)].

Hmm, perhaps this can be simplified. Let's compute each term:

First term: (1 - cos20°)/(1 + cos20°). Let's denote this as T1.

Second term: (1 - cos100°)/(1 + cos100°) = T2.

Third term: (1 - cos140°)/(1 + cos140°) = T3.

Compute each term:

First, note that cos100° = cos(180° - 80°) = -cos80°, and cos140° = cos(180° - 40°) = -cos40°. Similarly, cos20° remains as is.

So:

T1 = (1 - cos20°)/(1 + cos20°),

T2 = [1 - (-cos80°)]/[1 + (-cos80°)] = (1 + cos80°)/(1 - cos80°),

T3 = [1 - (-cos40°)]/[1 + (-cos40°)] = (1 + cos40°)/(1 - cos40°).

So T2 and T3 have denominators similar to each other, but with different angles. Let's compute T2 + T3:

T2 + T3 = [(1 + cos80°)/(1 - cos80°)] + [(1 + cos40°)/(1 - cos40°)].

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Let's compute each fraction:

For T2: (1 + cos80°)/(1 - cos80°). Let's rationalize the denominator by multiplying numerator and denominator by (1 + cos80°):

[(1 + cos80°)^2]/[1 - cos²80°] = [1 + 2cos80° + cos²80°]/[sin²80°].

Similarly for T3: (1 + cos40°)/(1 - cos40°) = [1 + 2cos40° + cos²40°]/[sin²40°].

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using the identity that (1 + cos theta)/(1 - cos theta) = cot²(theta/2). Let me verify:

Yes, (1 + cos theta)/(1 - cos theta) = (2 cos²(theta/2))/(2 sin²(theta/2)) ) = cot²(theta/2). Therefore:

T2 = cot²(40°),

T3 = cot²(20°),

T1 = tan²10°.

Therefore, the sum T1 + T2 + T3 = tan²10° + cot²40° + cot²20°, which is exactly the same as before. So we come back to the original expression. Therefore, this approach doesn't help in simplifying further.

Alternatively, perhaps considering that tan10°, tan50°, tan70° are related through some equation. For example, perhaps using the identity that tan3theta tan2theta tantheta = tan3theta tan2theta tantheta. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using the identity that tanA tan(60° - A) tan(60° + A) = tan3A. As mentioned earlier, for A=10
