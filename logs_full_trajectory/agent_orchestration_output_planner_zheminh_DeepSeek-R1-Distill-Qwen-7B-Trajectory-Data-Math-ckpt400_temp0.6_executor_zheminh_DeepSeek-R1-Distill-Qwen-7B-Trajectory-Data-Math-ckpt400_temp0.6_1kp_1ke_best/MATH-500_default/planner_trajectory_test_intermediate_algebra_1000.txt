<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to find the smallest positive real number \( a \) such that all roots of the cubic equation \( x^3 + a x^2 + a x + 1 = 0 \) are real. Hmm, let's start by recalling that for a cubic equation, having all real roots means that the graph of the cubic touches the x-axis three times. Since the leading coefficient is positive (1 for \( x^3 \)), the cubic will go from negative infinity to positive infinity as \( x \) goes from negative to positive. So, it must have a local maximum and a local minimum, and between those two turning points, the graph must cross the x-axis three times. That implies that the local maximum must be above the x-axis and the local minimum must be below the x-axis. Alternatively, if both turning points are on the same side of the x-axis, then there would be only one real root. So, the discriminant condition might come into play here. But maybe there's a better way using calculus or factoring.

First, let me check if the cubic can be factored. The equation is \( x^3 + a x^2 + a x + 1 = 0 \). Maybe grouping terms?

<prompt_1.1> Factor the cubic equation \( x^3 + a x^2 + a x + 1 = 0 \) using the above plan. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
Let's see:

Group as \( (x^3 + 1) + (a x^2 + a x) \). 

We know that \( x^3 + 1 = (x + 1)(x^2 - x + 1) \). So, factoring that part:

\( (x + 1)(x^2 - x + 1) + a x (x + 1) = 0 \).

Oh, wait! Both terms have a common factor of \( (x + 1) \). So factor that out:

\( (x + 1)(x^2 - x + 1 + a x) = 0 \).

Simplify the quadratic part: \( x^2 - x + 1 + a x = x^2 + (a - 1)x + 1 \).

So, the equation factors into \( (x + 1)(x^2 + (a - 1)x + 1) = 0 \).
</execution_1.1>
</Execution_1>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Therefore, the roots are \( x = -1 \) and the roots of the quadratic \( x^2 + (a - 1)x + 1 = 0 \). For all roots to be real, the quadratic must also have real roots. The quadratic \( x^2 + (a - 1)x + 1 \) will have real roots if its discriminant is non-negative.

<prompt_2.1> Determine the condition for the quadratic \( x^2 + (a - 1)x + 1 = 0 \) to have real roots using the above plan. </prompt_2.1>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
The discriminant \( D \) is \( [(a - 1)]^2 - 4 \times 1 \times 1 \geq 0 \).

Calculating that: \( (a - 1)^2 - 4 \geq 0 \).

Expanding \( (a - 1)^2 \): \( a^2 - 2a + 1 - 4 \geq 0 \) → \( a^2 - 2a - 3 \geq 0 \).

Factor the quadratic: \( a^2 - 2a - 3 = (a - 3)(a + 1) \). So, \( (a - 3)(a + 1) \geq 0 \).

Since \( a \) is a positive real number, \( a + 1 \) is always positive (because \( a > 0 \)), so the inequality \( (a - 3)(a + 1) \geq 0 \) holds when \( a - 3 \geq 0 \), i.e., \( a \geq 3 \).
</execution_2.1>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Therefore, the smallest possible value of \( a \) is 3.

Wait, but let me verify this. If \( a = 3 \), then the quadratic becomes \( x^2 + (3 - 1)x + 1 = x^2 + 2x + 1 \), which factors as \( (x + 1)^2 \).
So, the original equation becomes \( (x + 1)^3 = 0 \), which has a triple root at \( x = -1 \). But the problem states that all roots are real. A triple root is still a real root, so that's acceptable.

However, if \( a > 3 \), the quadratic would have two distinct real roots, so the original cubic would have three distinct real roots (including \( x = -1 \)). But when \( a = 3 \), there's a multiple root. So, the minimal \( a \) is 3.

But wait, hold on. Let me check if there's another way where even if the quadratic doesn't have a root at \( x = -1 \), but maybe some other condition. Let me think again.

<prompt_3.1> Re-evaluate the factorization and confirm the condition for all roots to be real using the above plan. </prompt_3.1>

But let me check for \( a = 3 \), the equation is \( x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1 = 0 \), which factors as \( (x + 1)^3 = 0 \), so triple root at \( x = -1 \). So that's valid. If \( a \) were less than 3, say \( a = 2 \), then the quadratic would be \( x^2 + (2 - 1)x + 1 = x^2 + x + 1 \), which has discriminant \( 1 - 4 = -3 < 0 \), so the quadratic has no real roots, meaning the original cubic would have only one real root \( x = -1 \) and two complex roots. Therefore, \( a = 3 \) is indeed the minimal value where all roots become real (with multiplicity).

But let me confirm once more. Suppose \( a = 3 \), then equation is \( x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1 = 0 \), which is \( (x + 1)^3 = 0 \).

But wait, let me check if there's a case where even if the quadratic has a double root, but maybe the original cubic has three real roots counting multiplicities. But in this case, when \( a = 3 \), the quadratic becomes \( (x + 1)^2 \), so the cubic becomes \( (x + 1)^3 \), so triple root. So, all roots are real.

But is there a smaller \( a \) where the quadratic has two distinct real roots, but the cubic still has three real roots? Wait, but if \( a \) is less than 3, the quadratic would have a negative discriminant, so no real roots. Therefore, the cubic can only have three real roots if the quadratic has two real roots, which requires \( a \geq 3 \). Therefore, the minimal \( a \) is indeed 3.

But let me consider another approach to confirm. Let's use calculus. For the cubic to have three real roots, it must have a local maximum above the x-axis and a local minimum below the x-axis (or vice versa, but since the leading coefficient is positive, the local maximum will be above and the local minimum below). So, let's compute the derivative of the cubic:

<prompt_3.2> Use calculus to confirm the condition for three real roots using the above plan. </prompt_3.2>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
Is there a case where the quadratic might have a repeated root but not at \( x = -1 \), but the cubic still has three real roots? Wait, but the quadratic is \( x^2 + (a - 1)x + 1 \). If it has a repeated root, say \( x = r \), then the cubic would have a root at \( x = -1 \) and a double root at \( x = r \). So, even if \( r \neq -1 \), as long as the quadratic has a repeated root, the cubic would have a triple root (if \( r = -1 \)) or a root at \( -1 \) and a double root elsewhere. But in either case, all roots are real. However, the discriminant condition gives the minimal \( a \) for which the quadratic has real roots, which is \( a \geq 3 \).
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
\( f(x) = x^3 + a x^2 + a x + 1 \)

\( f'(x) = 3x^2 + 2a x + a \)

Set derivative equal to zero to find critical points:

\( 3x^2 + 2a x + a = 0 \)

Solving for x:

\( x = \frac{ -2a \pm \sqrt{(2a)^2 - 4 \times 3 \times a} }{ 2 \times 3 } = \frac{ -2a \pm \sqrt{4a^2 - 12a} }{ 6 } = \frac{ -2a \pm 2\sqrt{a^2 - 3a} }{ 6 } = \frac{ -a \pm \sqrt{a^2 - 3a} }{ 3 } \)

So, the critical points exist only if the discriminant \( a^2 - 3a \geq 0 \). That is, \( a(a - 3) \geq 0 \). Since \( a > 0 \), this inequality holds when \( a \geq 3 \). Therefore, when \( a \geq 3 \), there are two critical points, and the cubic has a local maximum and a local minimum. If \( a < 3 \), there are no real critical points, so the cubic is monotonically increasing (since the derivative \( 3x^2 + 2a x + a \) would always be positive? Let's check.

If \( a < 3 \), the derivative quadratic \( 3x^2 + 2a x + a \) has a negative discriminant \( 4a^2 - 12a = 4a(a - 3) \), which is negative because \( a < 3 \). Therefore, the derivative quadratic is always positive (since the coefficient of \( x^2 \) is 3 > 0), so the function is always increasing. Therefore, the cubic can only have one real root when \( a < 3 \). Therefore, for there to be three real roots, we must have \( a \geq 3 \). So, the minimal \( a \) is 3.

This confirms the earlier result from factoring. Therefore, the smallest possible value of \( a \) is 3.
</execution_3.2>
</Execution_3>

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.2:
Wait, but let me check for \( a = 3 \), the derivative is \( 3x^2 + 6x + 3 = 3(x^2 + 2x + 1) = 3(x + 1)^2 \), which is always non-negative, and equals zero at \( x = -1 \). Therefore, the cubic has a stationary point at \( x = -1 \), which is also a root. So, the graph touches the x-axis there and turns around, resulting in a triple root.

But in this case, even though the derivative has a repeated root, the original cubic has a triple root. So, the multiplicity counts, but the problem states "all roots are real," which is satisfied here. So, 3 is indeed the minimal value.

Alternatively, suppose there was a case where the cubic had three distinct real roots when \( a < 3 \). But according to the calculus approach, when \( a < 3 \), the derivative has no real roots, so the function is strictly increasing, hence can cross the x-axis only once. Therefore, there are no three real roots when \( a < 3 \). Therefore, the minimal \( a \) is 3.

Another way to think about it: using the fact that for all roots of the cubic to be real, the cubic must satisfy certain inequalities, perhaps related to symmetric functions. Let me consider Vieta's formulas.

<prompt_4.1> Use Vieta's formulas to confirm the condition for all roots to be real using the above plan. </prompt_4.1>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
Suppose the roots are \( r, s, t \), all real. Then:

\( r + s + t = -a \) (from the coefficient of \( x^2 \))

\( rs + rt + st = a \) (from the coefficient of \( x \))

\( rst = -1 \) (from the constant term)

So, we have:

1. \( r + s + t = -a \)

2. \( rs + rt + st = a \)

3. \( rst = -1 \)

We need to find the minimal \( a > 0 \) such that all roots \( r, s, t \) are real.

This seems more complicated, but maybe we can use some inequalities here. For example, using the AM ≥ GM inequality, but since the roots can be negative or positive, we have to be careful.

Alternatively, let's assume that one of the roots is negative and the other two are positive. Because the product \( rst = -1 \), which is negative, so there must be an odd number of negative roots. So, either one or all three roots are negative. But if all three roots are negative, then their product would be negative (since three negatives multiply to a negative), which matches \( rst = -1 \). However, if all three roots are negative, let's see:

Let me suppose all roots are negative. Let \( r = -p \), \( s = -q \), \( t = -u \), where \( p, q, u > 0 \). Then:

\( (-p) + (-q) + (-u) = - (p + q + u) = -a \) ⇒ \( p + q + u = a \)

\( (-p)(-q) + (-p)(-u) + (-q)(-u) = pq + pu + qu = a \)

\( (-p)(-q)(-u) = -pqr = -1 \) ⇒ \( p q u = 1 \)

So, in terms of positive variables \( p, q, u \), we have:

\( p + q + u = a \)

\( pq + pu + qu = a \)

\( p q u = 1 \)

We need to find the minimal \( a > 0 \) such that there exist positive real numbers \( p, q, u \) satisfying these equations.

This seems like a system that can be approached using inequalities. For example, using AM ≥ GM on \( p, q, u \):

\( \frac{p + q + u}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{p q u} \)

Which gives:

\( \frac{a}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{1} \) ⇒ \( \frac{a}{3} \geq 1 \) ⇒ \( a \geq 3 \)

Equality holds when \( p = q = u = 1 \). So, if \( p = q = u = 1 \), then \( a = 3 \), and indeed, the equations are satisfied:

\( 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \)

\( 1 \times 1 + 1 \times 1 + 1 \times 1 = 3 \)

\( 1 \times 1 \times 1 = 1 \)

Therefore, this corresponds to the roots \( r = s = t = -1 \), which is the case when \( a = 3 \). So, this confirms again that the minimal \( a \) is 3. Moreover, since the equality in AM ≥ GM occurs when all variables are equal, this is the minimal case.

Alternatively, if we considered the case where only one root is negative and the other two are positive, let's see if that's possible. Let \( r = -p \), \( s = q \), \( t = u \), with \( p, q, u > 0 \). Then:

\( -p + q + u = -a \)

\( (-p)q + (-p)u + q u = -pq - pu + qu = a \)

\( (-p) q u = -p q u = -1 \) ⇒ \( p q u = 1 \)

So, from the first equation: \( q + u = p - a \)

From the second equation: \( -p(q + u) + q u = a \)

But substituting \( q + u = p - a \) into the second equation:

\( -p(p - a) + q u = a \)

⇒ \( -p^2 + a p + q u = a \)

But from the product \( p q u = 1 \), since \( q u = \frac{1}{p} \), substitute that:

\( -p^2 + a p + \frac{1}{p} = a \)

Rearranged:

\( -p^2 + a p + \frac{1}{p} - a = 0 \)

Multiply both sides by \( p \) to eliminate the denominator:

\( -p^3 + a p^2 + 1 - a p = 0 \)

⇒ \( -p^3 + a p^2 - a p + 1 = 0 \)

Multiply both sides by -1:

\( p^3 - a p^2 + a p - 1 = 0 \)

Factor this cubic in \( p \):

Let me try to factor it. Let's see if \( p = 1 \) is a root:

\( 1 - a + a - 1 = 0 \). Yes, \( p = 1 \) is a root. Therefore, factor out \( (p - 1) \):

Using polynomial division or synthetic division:

Divide \( p^3 - a p^2 + a p - 1 \) by \( p - 1 \):

Coefficients: 1 | -a | a | -1

Bring down 1. Multiply by 1: 1. Add to next coefficient: -a + 1.

Multiply by 1: (-a + 1). Add to next coefficient: a + (-a + 1) = 1.

Multiply by 1: 1. Add to last coefficient: -1 + 1 = 0.

So, the cubic factors as \( (p - 1)(p^2 + (-a + 1)p + 1) = 0 \).

Therefore, the roots are \( p = 1 \) and the roots of \( p^2 + (-a + 1)p + 1 = 0 \).

For real positive roots, discriminant must be non-negative:

\( [(-a + 1)]^2 - 4 \times 1 \times 1 \geq 0 \)

⇒ \( (a - 1)^2 - 4 \geq 0 \)

⇒ \( a^2 - 2a + 1 - 4 \geq 0 \)

⇒ \( a^2 - 2a - 3 \geq 0 \)

Which is the same quadratic as before, factoring to \( (a - 3)(a + 1) \geq 0 \). Since \( a > 0 \), this holds when \( a \geq 3 \).

So, if \( a \geq 3 \), then the quadratic \( p^2 + (-a + 1)p + 1 = 0 \) has real roots. Let's check if they are positive.

The quadratic equation \( p^2 + (-a + 1)p + 1 = 0 \). The roots are:

\( p = \frac{ (a - 1) \pm \sqrt{(a - 1)^2 - 4} }{ 2 } \)

Since \( a \geq 3 \), discriminant is non-negative. Let's check if the roots are positive.

Sum of roots: \( a - 1 > 0 \) (since \( a \geq 3 \)), product of roots is 1 > 0. Therefore, both roots are positive. Therefore, in this case, when \( a \geq 3 \), there exists a positive real number \( p \) (specifically, two positive ones) such that the original system has a solution with one negative root and two positive roots. Wait, but earlier when we considered all roots negative, we also found that \( a \geq 3 \). So, in both cases (all roots negative or two positive and one negative), we require \( a \geq 3 \).

But in the case where one root is negative and two are positive, even if \( a \geq 3 \), but when \( a = 3 \), let's see:

If \( a = 3 \), then the quadratic becomes \( p^2 + (-3 + 1)p + 1 = p^2 - 2p + 1 = (p - 1)^2 \). So, double root at \( p = 1 \). Therefore, the roots are \( p = 1 \) (double root) and \( p = 1 \) (from the factor \( p - 1 \)). Therefore, the roots are \( p = 1, 1, 1 \). Therefore, the original roots would be \( r = -1 \), \( s = 1 \), \( t = 1 \). Wait, but no, wait: in this case, if \( p = 1 \), then \( q u = 1/p = 1 \), and since the quadratic has a double root, \( q = u = 1 \). So, the roots are \( r = -1 \), \( s = 1 \), \( t = 1 \). Therefore, the cubic would factor as \( (x + 1)(x - 1)^2 \), which expands to \( (x + 1)(x^2 - 2x + 1) = x^3 - 2x^2 + x + x^2 - 2x + 1 = x^3 - x^2 - x + 1 \). Wait, but when \( a = 3 \), the original equation is \( x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1 = 0 \), which factors as \( (x + 1)^3 \). Therefore, this seems contradictory. So, perhaps there is a mistake here.

Wait, maybe when we split into cases, considering one negative root and two positive roots, but in reality, when \( a = 3 \), the cubic has a triple root at \( x = -1 \), so all roots are negative (well, repeated negative). Therefore, the case where one root is negative and two are positive does not occur when \( a = 3 \). Therefore, perhaps the case where all roots are negative (with \( a = 3 \)) is a separate case from the case where one root is negative and two are positive. But when \( a = 3 \), the case where one root is negative and two are positive leads to a contradiction, because if we set \( a = 3 \), then trying to have one negative and two positive roots leads to the cubic having a triple root at \( x = -1 \), which is not in the case of one negative and two positive roots. Therefore, perhaps the case where all roots are negative ( triple root at \( x = -1 \)) is a separate scenario from the case where one root is negative and two are positive.

But in any case, through both the calculus approach and the Vieta's formula approach using AM ≥ GM, we find that the minimal \( a \) is 3. Therefore, the answer is 3.
</execution_4.1>
</Execution_4>

<Plan_5>
Based on execution_4.1:
But just to be thorough, let me check if there's any other possible configuration. For example, suppose two roots are equal and negative, and the third is also negative but different. Wait, but in the AM ≥ GM case, when equality holds, all variables are equal, so that's the case of triple root.

Alternatively, suppose two roots are equal and positive, and one negative. But in that case, the product \( rst = -1 \), so if two roots are positive and one is negative, their product is negative, which matches. But according to the earlier Vieta's formula analysis, if we have one negative root and two positive roots, then the minimal \( a \) is still 3. So, even if we have two equal positive roots and one negative root, the minimal \( a \) required is still 3.

Therefore, regardless of the root configuration (all roots negative or two positive and one negative), the minimal \( a \) is 3. Hence, the answer is 3.

Another check: suppose \( a = 3 \), then the equation is \( x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1 = 0 \), which factors as \( (x + 1)^3 \), so triple root at \( x = -1 \). If \( a \) is slightly less than 3, say \( a = 2.9 \), then the quadratic \( x^2 + (2.9 - 1)x + 1 = x^2 + 1.9x + 1 \). The discriminant is \( (1.9)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times 1 = 3.61 - 4 = -0.39 < 0 \). Therefore, the quadratic has no real roots, so the original cubic has only one real root, which is \( x = -1 \), and two complex roots. Therefore, \( a = 3 \) is indeed the minimal value where all roots become real (triple root).
