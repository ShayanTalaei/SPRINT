</Question>

<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to figure out how many ways 6 girls and 2 boys can sit in a row, but the two boys want to sit next to each other. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem. We have a total of 8 people: 6 girls and 2 boys. They need to be arranged in a row, but the two boys must be adjacent. 

First, maybe I can think of the two boys as a single unit since they have to sit together. If I do that, instead of arranging 8 individuals, I'm arranging 7 units: the 6 girls plus the 1 combined boy unit. But wait, the combined unit can have the two boys in two different orders, right? Like Boy A next to Boy B or Boy B next to Boy A. So I need to account for that.

Let me break it down step by step.

If the two boys are a single unit, then the total number of units to arrange is 7. The number of ways to arrange 7 units is 7 factorial, which is 7!

<prompt_1.1> Calculate the number of ways to arrange 7 units using factorials. </prompt_1.1>

But then, within that unit, the two boys can switch places. So for each of those arrangements, there are 2! ways to arrange the boys within their unit.

<prompt_1.2> Calculate the total number of arrangements by multiplying the number of arrangements of 7 units by the number of ways to arrange the boys within their unit. </prompt_1.2>

Alternatively, maybe another way to think about it is to consider the positions in the row. There are 8 seats. The two boys have to sit next to each other, so they can occupy positions (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5), (5,6), (6,7), or (7,8). So that's 7 possible pairs of adjacent seats.

<prompt_1.3> Calculate the number of ways to choose adjacent seats for the boys and arrange the girls. </prompt_1.3>

Alternatively, if I tried to use permutations with the boys together, another approach is to treat the two boys as a single entity, so we have 7 entities to permute, which is 7!

<prompt_1.4> Compare different approaches and confirm the solution using permutations and combinations. </prompt_1.4>

= 5040. Then, multiplying by 2! for the arrangements within the boy unit. So 7! * 2! = 5040 * 2 = 10080.
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
That makes sense. So the total number of arrangements should be 7! multiplied by 2!

Let me check if that's right. 

Wait, let me verify. Suppose there are n units, the number of ways to arrange them is n! . Here, after treating the two boys as one unit, we have 7 units, so 7! arrangements. Then, the two boys can be arranged in 2! ways within their unit. So the total is indeed 7! * 2!
</execution_1.2>

<execution_1.3>
For each of those 7 positions, the two boys can be arranged in 2! ways (AB or BA). Then, the remaining 6 seats are for the girls, and there are 6! ways to arrange them. So multiplying these together: 7 * 2! * 6! . Which is the same as 7 * 2 * 720 = 10080.
</execution_1.3>

<execution_1.4>
multiplied by 2! for the permutations of the boys within their entity. So 7! Ã— 2! .

That's the same result as before. So both methods give 10,080.
</execution_1.4>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1, execution_1.2:
Let me compute that. 7! is 5040, and 2!

<prompt_2.1> Compute the final result by multiplying 7! with 2! and check if it matches the alternative approach. </prompt_2.1>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
is 2, so 5040 * 2 = 10,080. 

Alternatively, if I think of the boys as a block, the number of blocks plus girls is 7. So arranging 7 blocks: 7! . Then, the boys can be in two orders: 2! . So same result.

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
But just to make sure I'm not missing anything else. Are there any other constraints? The problem says the two boys insist on sitting next to each other. It doesn't mention anything else, like some people not wanting to sit together or specific seats.

<prompt_3.1> Verify the solution by considering any other potential constraints or factors. </prompt_3.1>

<execution_3.1>
So it's just a straightforward arrangement with the boys as a block. 

Another way to think about it: if the two boys must be together, we can consider them as a single entity. The total number of entities to arrange is 7 (6 girls + 1 boy pair). The number of permutations is 7! for the entities. Then, since the boys can switch places, multiply by 2. The girls can be arranged among themselves in 6! ways, but wait, no, the girls are distinct, so once the entities are arranged, the girls are placed in their specific seats, so their permutations are already accounted for in the 7! ?

Wait, maybe not. Let me clarify. 

When we treat the two boys as a single entity, the total number of "positions" is 7. These 7 positions are the 6 single girls and the 1 boy pair. So arranging these 7 entities in 7! ways. But each of these entities includes the girls and the boy pair. Then, within the boy pair, there are 2! arrangements. So the total is 7! * 2! .

Alternatively, if we first arrange the girls and then place the boys, but that might complicate. Let's see. If we arrange the 6 girls first, which can be done in 6! ways. Then, the boys need to be placed in adjacent seats. How many ways can we place the two boys next to each other among the 8 seats? 

Between 6 girls arranged in a row, there are 7 gaps where the boys can be placed: _ G _ G _ G _ G _ G _ G _ 

But wait, the boys need to be next to each other, so they would occupy two adjacent gaps. Wait, no. If the girls are arranged, the possible places for the boys to sit together would be the spaces before the first girl, between each pair of girls, and after the last girl. That's 7 gaps. But if the boys are placed in two adjacent gaps, that would mean they are separated by a girl. But the problem states the boys must sit next to each other. So actually, the boys have to be placed in the same gap, but the gaps are the spaces between seats. Hmm, maybe this approach is not the right way. 

Wait, perhaps better to think that when arranging the girls first, there are 7 possible positions for the boy pair: before the first girl, between each pair of girls (6 positions), and after the last girl. So 7 positions. Then, within each of those positions, the boy pair can be arranged in 2! ways. Then, the girls are arranged in 6! ways. So total arrangements would be 6! * 7 * 2! = 720 * 7 * 2 = 720 * 14 = 10,080. Which matches the previous result.

Based on execution_3.1:
Therefore, the answer is 10,080. 

But just to be thorough, let's consider another angle. Suppose we number the seats from 1 to 8.

<prompt_4.1> Consider another angle by numbering the seats and calculate the number of ways to seat the boys and girls. </prompt_4.1>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
The two boys must occupy two consecutive seats. How many pairs of consecutive seats are there? From 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6, 6-7, 7-8: that's 7 pairs. For each pair, the two boys can be arranged in 2! ways. Then, the remaining 6 seats are for the girls, who can be arranged in 6! ways. So total arrangements: 7 * 2! * 6! = 7 * 2 * 720 = 14 * 720 = 10,080.
</execution_4.1>
</Execution_4>

<Final_answer>
Therefore, the total number of ways the 2 boys can sit next to each other is $\boxed{10080}$.
