</Question>

<Plan_1>
Okay, let's see. I need to figure out what kind of graph the equation \(\left(\frac{x}{2} - 3\right)^2 + y^2 = 10\) represents. The options are parabola, circle, ellipse, hyperbola, point, line, two lines, or empty. Hmm. Alright, let me start by recalling the standard forms of these conic sections and comparing them to the given equation.

First, the equation given is \(\left(\frac{x}{2} - 3\right)^2 + y^2 = 10\). Let me try to rewrite this equation in a more familiar form. Maybe expanding the terms or completing the square?

Let me first simplify the x-term. The term \(\frac{x}{2} - 3\) can be rewritten as \(\frac{1}{2}x - 3\). So, squaring that would give \(\left(\frac{1}{2}x - 3\right)^2\). Let me expand that part.

</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
Expanding \(\left(\frac{1}{2}x - 3\right)^2\):

\[
\left(\frac{1}{2}x - 3\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{2}x\right)^2 - 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2}x \cdot 3 + 3^2 = \frac{1}{4}x^2 - 3x + 9
\]

So substituting back into the original equation:

\[
\frac{1}{4}x^2 - 3x + 9 + y^2 = 10
\]

Combine the constant terms:

\[
\frac{1}{4}x^2 - 3x + y^2 + 9 - 10 = 0
\]
\[
\frac{1}{4}x^2 - 3x + y^2 - 1 = 0
\]

Hmm. So that's a quadratic equation in x and y. Let's see.

Based on execution_1.1:
The general form of a conic section is \(Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0\). In this case, after moving everything to one side, we have:

<prompt_2.1> Identify the type of conic section by comparing the equation to the general form of conic sections. </prompt_2.1>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
- \(A = \frac{1}{4}\)
- \(B = 0\) (since there's no xy term)
- \(C = 1\)
- \(D = -3\)
- \(E = 0\)
- \(F = -1\)

Since there's no xy term (B=0), it's either a circle, ellipse, parabola, or hyperbola. The presence of both \(x^2\) and \(y^2\) terms suggests it's a conic section. Since the coefficients of \(x^2\) and \(y^2\) are both positive (A=1/4 and C=1), but they are not equal, that might indicate an ellipse. However, the standard form of an ellipse is \(\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} + \frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1\). Let me see if I can rewrite the original equation into that form.

Starting again with the original equation:

\[
\left(\frac{x}{2} - 3\right)^2 + y^2 = 10
\]

Let me make a substitution to simplify the x-term. Let’s let \(u = \frac{x}{2} - 3\). Then the equation becomes:

\[
u^2 + y^2 = 10
\]

That looks like the equation of a circle in the u-y coordinate system. But u is a linear transformation of x. So, in terms of x and y, this is an ellipse.
</execution_2.1>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Wait, let me check.

If \(u = \frac{x}{2} - 3\), then solving for x gives \(x = 2(u + 3)\). So, substituting back, the equation \(u^2 + y^2 = 10\) is equivalent to \(\left(\frac{x}{2} - 3\right)^2 + y^2 = 10\).

To see the standard form, let's divide both sides by 10:

<prompt_3.1> Rewrite the equation in standard form to confirm it is an ellipse. </prompt_3.1>

Alternatively, expanding the original equation and comparing to the general conic form. Let's do that.

<prompt_3.2> Expand the equation and compare it to the general form to confirm it is an ellipse. </prompt_3.2>

Now, to confirm whether it's a circle, ellipse, parabola, or hyperbola. Since there's no xy term, and both x^2 and y^2 are present, it's either a circle or ellipse. The coefficients of x^2 and y^2 are different (1/4 and 1), so it's an ellipse, not a circle.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let's recall that in the standard ellipse equation, if the coefficients are different but both positive, it's an ellipse. If they are equal, it's a circle.

<prompt_3.3> Confirm the type of conic section by comparing coefficients and shapes. </prompt_3.3>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
\[
\frac{\left(\frac{x}{2} - 3\right)^2}{10} + \frac{y^2}{10} = 1
\]

But if we want to write it in the standard ellipse form, we might need to adjust the denominators. Let's see.

Alternatively, let's complete the square for the x-term in the original equation. Wait, but the equation is already in a form similar to the standard ellipse. Let me think.

Alternatively, if I expand the original equation and rearrange terms, maybe I can see it as an ellipse. Let's try that.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
Original equation:

\[
\left(\frac{x}{2} - 3\right)^2 + y^2 = 10
\]

Expanding the x-term as before:

\[
\frac{1}{4}x^2 - 3x + 9 + y^2 = 10
\]

Subtract 10:

\[
\frac{1}{4}x^2 - 3x + y^2 - 1 = 0
\]

Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the fraction:

\[
x^2 - 12x + 4y^2 - 4 = 0
\]

Hmm, so in standard form, this is:

\[
x^2 - 12x + 4y^2 = 4
\]

Now, to complete the square for the x-terms. Let's group x terms and y terms:

\[
x^2 - 12x + 4y^2 = 4
\]

Factor out the coefficient of \(x^2\) from the x terms (which is 1 in this case, so actually, no need). Wait, the x terms are \(x^2 - 12x\). To complete the square:

Take the coefficient of x, which is -12, divide by 2 to get -6, square it to get 36. So:

\[
x^2 - 12x + 36 + 4y^2 = 4 + 36
\]
\[
(x - 6)^2 + 4y^2 = 40
\]

Now, divide both sides by 40 to get 1 on the right:

\[
\frac{(x - 6)^2}{40} + \frac{4y^2}{40} = 1
\]
\[
\frac{(x - 6)^2}{40} + \frac{y^2}{10} = 1
\]

Yes, that's the standard form of an ellipse centered at (6, 0) with semi-major axis \(\sqrt{40}\) along the x-axis and semi-minor axis \(\sqrt{10}\) along the y-axis.
</execution_3.2>

<execution_3.3>
Here, since 1/4 ≠ 1, it's an ellipse. However, the major and minor axes depend on the coefficients. Since the coefficient of x^2 is smaller (1/4 < 1), the major axis would be along the x-axis, but in this case, after substitution, maybe not. Wait, perhaps I need to adjust for the scaling.

Alternatively, if we consider the equation in terms of x and y, let's complete the square for the x terms. Wait, the equation is already kind of separated. Let me see.

Original equation:

\[
\left(\frac{x}{2} - 3\right)^2 + y^2 = 10
\]

Let me write this as:

\[
\left(\frac{x - 6}{2}\right)^2 + y^2 = 10
\]
\[
\frac{(x - 6)^2}{4} + y^2 = 10
\]

Ah! Now, this looks like the standard form of an ellipse. The standard form is \(\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} + \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1\). But here, the right-hand side is 10, not 1. So, to get it into standard form, divide both sides by 10:

\[
\frac{(x - 6)^2}{4 \cdot 10} + \frac{y^2}{10} = 1
\]
\[
\frac{(x - 6)^2}{40} + \frac{y^2}{10} = 1
\]

So, this is indeed an ellipse centered at (6, 0) with semi-major axis \(\sqrt{40}\) along the x-axis and semi-minor axis \(\sqrt{10}\) along the y-axis. Therefore, the graph is an ellipse.

Based on execution_3.3:
Let me double-check by considering the discriminant of the general conic equation.

<prompt_4.1> Double-check the type of conic section using the discriminant. </prompt_4.1>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
The general form is \(Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0\). The discriminant is \(B^2 - 4AC\). If the discriminant is:

- Less than 0: ellipse (or circle if B=0 and A=C)
- Equal to 0: parabola
- Greater than 0: hyperbola

In our case, B=0, A=1/4, C=1. So discriminant is \(0 - 4*(1/4)*1 = -1\), which is less than 0. Therefore, it's an ellipse.
</execution_4.1>
</Execution_4>

<Plan_5>
Based on execution_4.1:
But just to be thorough, let me visualize this equation. The equation \(\left(\frac{x}{2} - 3\right)^2 + y^2 = 10\) is similar to the equation of a circle but stretched in the x-direction.

<prompt_5.1> Visualize and confirm the graph is an ellipse. </prompt_5.1>
</Plan_5>

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
The term \(\frac{x}{2} - 3\) can be rewritten as \(\frac{1}{2}(x - 6)\), so squaring that gives \(\frac{1}{4}(x - 6)^2\). Therefore, the equation is:

\[
\frac{1}{4}(x - 6)^2 + y^2 = 10
\]

Multiplying both sides by 4 to eliminate the fraction:

\[
(x - 6)^2 + 4y^2 = 40
\]

Which is the standard form of an ellipse centered at (6, 0), with a horizontal major axis (since the denominator under \(x^2\) is larger) of length \(2a = 2\sqrt{40}\) and a vertical minor axis of length \(2b = 2\sqrt{10}\). So, yes, this is an ellipse.

Alternatively, if someone isn't sure, they can plug in some points. For example, when y=0, solve for x:

\[
\left(\frac{x}{2} - 3\right)^2 = 10
\]
\[
\frac{x}{2} - 3 = \pm\sqrt{10}
\]
\[
\frac{x}{2} = 3 \pm \sqrt{10}
\]
\[
x = 6 \pm 2\sqrt{10}
\]

So, the ellipse intersects the x-axis at \(6 \pm 2\sqrt{10}\), which are two points, consistent with an ellipse. Similarly, when x=6, solve for y:

\[
\left(\frac{6}{2} - 3\right)^2 + y^2 = 10
\]
\[
(3 - 3)^2 + y^2 = 10
\]
\[
0 + y^2 = 10
\]
\[
y = \pm\sqrt{10}
\]

So, the ellipse intersects the y-axis at \(y = \pm\sqrt{10}\), which are two points. If it were a circle, the intersections would be symmetric in both x and y directions, but here the x-intercepts are spread out more, and the y-intercepts are less spread out, which is typical for an ellipse.

Another check: the equation has real solutions because the right-hand side is 10, which is positive. If the right-hand side were zero, it would be a single point (if the equation reduces to (something)^2 + (something)^2 =0), but since it's 10, which is positive, it's a conic section. Since it's an ellipse, as we determined.

Therefore, after all this analysis, I can conclude that the graph of the given equation is an ellipse.
