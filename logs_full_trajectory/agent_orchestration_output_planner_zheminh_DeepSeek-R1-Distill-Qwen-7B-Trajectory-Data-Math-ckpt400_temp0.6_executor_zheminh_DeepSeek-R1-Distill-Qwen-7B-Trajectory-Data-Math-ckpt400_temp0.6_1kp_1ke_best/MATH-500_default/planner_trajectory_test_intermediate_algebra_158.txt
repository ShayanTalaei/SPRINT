Okay, so I need to find the maximum value of the expression ab²c³d⁴ given that a, b, c, d are positive real numbers and their sum is 10, i.e., a + b + c + d = 10. Hmm, this seems like an optimization problem with a constraint. I remember that for such problems, methods like Lagrange multipliers can be used, but since all variables are positive, maybe the AM-GM inequality approach could also work. Let me think through both options.

First, let's recall the AM-GM inequality, which states that for non-negative real numbers, the arithmetic mean is at least the geometric mean, with equality when all numbers are equal. However, in this case, the expression ab²c³d⁴ isn't a simple product or sum, but a product with different exponents. Maybe I can adjust the variables to apply AM-GM properly.

Alternatively, using Lagrange multipliers might be more straightforward, even though it's a bit more involved. Let me try both approaches and see which one works better.

Starting with the AM-GM approach. To apply AM-GM here, I need to express the variables in a way that their coefficients in the constraint (a + b + c + d = 10) correspond to the exponents in the product ab²c³d⁴. Let me see.

The exponents of a, b, c, d in the product are 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively. So, if I consider each term in the product, I can split the variables into parts corresponding to their exponents. For example, a can be thought of as one part, b as two parts (since it's squared), c as three parts, and d as four parts. Then, the total number of parts would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 parts. Wait, interesting, and the total sum is 10. So maybe each part is 1, and the sum of all parts is 10. Let me formalize this.

Let me write a as a = x₁, b as two variables x₂ and x₃ (so b = x₂ + x₃), c as three variables x₄, x₅, x₆, and d as four variables x₇, x₈, x₉, x₁₀. Then, the sum a + b + c + d becomes x₁ + (x₂ + x₃) + (x₄ + x₅ + x₆) + (x₇ + x₈ + x₉ + x₁₀) = x₁ + x₂ + x₃ + x₄ + x₅ + x₆ + x₇ + x₈ + x₉ + x₁₀ = 10. So, we have 10 variables each corresponding to a part. Then, the product ab²c³d⁴ would be x₁ * (x₂ + x₃)² * (x₄ + x₅ + x₆)³ * (x₇ + x₈ + x₉ + x₁₀)^4. Hmm, but this seems complicated. Wait, maybe instead of splitting them into individual variables, I can use the weighted AM-GM inequality.

The weighted AM-GM inequality states that for positive real numbers and positive weights that sum to 1, the weighted arithmetic mean is at least the weighted geometric mean. Alternatively, for weights w₁, w₂, ...., wₙ, the inequality is (w₁a₁ + w₂a₂ + ... + wₙaₙ) ≥ a₁^{w₁}a₂^{w₂}...aₙ^{wₙ}, with equality when a₁/w₁ = a₂/w₂ = ... = aₙ/wₙ.

In this problem, since the exponents in the product ab²c³d⁴ correspond to the coefficients in the constraint. Wait, the exponents are 1,2,3,4 for a,b,c,d. So maybe the weights for AM-GM should correspond to these exponents? Let me check.

If I consider the terms in the product ab²c³d⁴, the exponents are 1,2,3,4. So, the total number of terms if we expand would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10. So perhaps, if we split the variables into 10 parts, each corresponding to a single term in the product. For example:

Now, let's try the Lagrange multipliers method to verify.

We need to maximize f(a,b,c,d) = ab²c³d⁴ subject to the constraint g(a,b,c,d) = a + b + c + d - 10 = 0.

The Lagrangian is L = ab²c³d⁴ - λ(a + b + c + d - 10).

Taking partial derivatives:

</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
a = x₁,
b = x₂ + x₃,
c = x₄ + x₅ + x₆,
d = x₇ + x₈ + x₉ + x₁₀.

Wait, but if we do that, the total sum a + b + c + d becomes x₁ + (x₂ + x₃) + (x₄ + x₅ + x₆) + (x₇ + x₈ + x₉ + x₁₀) = 10. Then, the product ab²c³d⁴ would be x₁ * (x₂ + x₃)^2 * (x₄ + x₅ + x₆)^3 * (x₇ + x₈ + x₉ + x₁₀)^4. But this seems more complicated. Alternatively, maybe instead of splitting variables, I can use the method of considering the variables as divided into parts according to their exponents.

Wait, another approach: Let me consider the exponents in the product as the number of times each variable appears. So, a is multiplied once, b twice, c three times, d four times. So, in total, there are 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 variables. Therefore, if I set each of these variables equal in the AM-GM inequality, then perhaps I can find the maximum.

Wait, perhaps using the method of Lagrange multipliers is more straightforward here. Let me try that.

∂L/∂a = b²c³d⁴ - λ = 0 → λ = b²c³d⁴

∂L/∂b = 2ab c³d⁴ - λ = 0 → 2ab c³d⁴ = λ

∂L/∂c = 3ab²c²d⁴ - λ = 0 → 3ab²c²d⁴ = λ

∂L/∂d = 4ab²c³d³ - λ = 0 → 4ab²c³d³ = λ

∂L/∂λ = -(a + b + c + d - 10) = 0 → a + b + c + d = 10

So, from the first equation, λ = b²c³d⁴.

From the second equation, 2ab c³d⁴ = λ. But λ is also equal to b²c³d⁴, so:

2ab c³d⁴ = b²c³d⁴ → Divide both sides by b c³ d⁴ (assuming they are non-zero, which they are):

2a = b → So, b = 2a.

From the third equation, 3ab²c²d⁴ = λ = b²c³d⁴.

So, 3ab²c²d⁴ = b²c³d⁴ → Divide both sides by b²c²d⁴:

3a = c → c = 3a.

From the fourth equation, 4ab²c³d³ = λ = b²c³d⁴.

So, 4ab²c³d³ = b²c³d³ * d → Divide both sides by b²c³d³:

4a = d → d = 4a.

So, now we have expressions for b, c, d in terms of a:

b = 2a, c = 3a, d = 4a.

Now, substitute these into the constraint a + b + c + d = 10:

a + 2a + 3a + 4a = 10 → 10a = 10 → a = 1.

Therefore, a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, d = 4. Then, the product ab²c³d⁴ is 1*(2)^2*(3)^3*(4)^4. Let's compute that:

2² = 4,

3³ = 27,

4⁴ = 256.

So, 1*4*27*256. Multiply step by step:

4*27 = 108,

108*256: Let's compute 100*256 = 25,600 and 8*256 = 2,048. So total is 25,600 + 2,048 = 27,648.

Therefore, the maximum value is 27,648.

Let me try to apply the weighted AM-GM inequality here. The idea is to split the total sum (10) into parts corresponding to the exponents. Since the exponents are 1, 2, 3, 4, the total parts would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 parts. Each part would then have equal value, say, each part is 1, since the total is 10.

Wait, but how does that relate to a, b, c, d? Let's think.

If we have a single part for a, two parts for b, three parts for c, and four parts for d, then each part would be equal to 1 (since total parts = 10 and total sum is 10). Therefore, each part is 1. Therefore:

a = 1 part → a = 1*1 = 1,

b = 2 parts → b = 2*1 = 2,

c = 3 parts → c = 3*1 = 3,

d = 4 parts → d = 4*1 = 4.

Therefore, substituting these values into the product ab²c³d⁴, we get:

1*(2)^2*(3)^3*(4)^4 = 1*4*27*256 = 27,648. So, according to this method, the maximum value is 27,648.

Using the weighted AM-GM inequality. The exponents in the product are 1, 2, 3, 4 for a, b, c, d respectively. So the weights would be proportional to these exponents. Wait, the total weight is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10. So, the weights are 1/10, 2/10, 3/10, 4/10 for a, b, c, d respectively.

Then, according to the weighted AM-GM inequality, we have:

( (1/10)a + (2/10)b + (3/10)c + (4/10)d ) ≥ (a^{1/10} b^{2/10} c^{3/10} d^{4/10} )

But the left side is (1/10)(a + 2b + 3c + 4d)/10? Wait, no. Wait, the weighted AM is (1/10)a + (2/10)b + (3/10)c + (4/10)d. But our constraint is a + b + c + d = 10. Not sure if this directly helps. Maybe not. Let me think.

Alternatively, if we consider the variables to be split into 10 variables as per the exponents. For example, since the product ab²c³d⁴ has exponents 1,2,3,4, we can think of this as 10 variables: 1 a, 2 b's, 3 c's, 4 d's. Then, the product would be (a * b * b * c * c * c * d * d * d * d). Then, the sum of these 10 variables is a + b + b + c + c + c + d + d + d + d = a + 2b + 3c + 4d. Wait, but our constraint is a + b + c + d = 10, not a + 2b + 3c + 4d. So that's different.

Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't directly applicable here. Maybe another way.

Alternatively, let's use substitution. Let me denote the variables in terms of the Lagrange multipliers result. Since we found that a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, d = 4, which satisfies a + b + c + d = 10, and the product is 27,648. Let me see if AM-GM gives the same.

Suppose we set up the problem using AM-GM with the terms corresponding to the exponents. Let me consider the product ab²c³d⁴. To apply AM-GM, we can write the product as:

a * b * b * c * c * c * d * d * d * d. So, 10 terms in total. Then, the arithmetic mean of these 10 terms is (a + b + b + c + c + c + d + d + d + d)/10. But our constraint is a + b + c + d = 10. Let's compute the sum a + b + b + c + c + c + d + d + d + d. That's a + 2b + 3c + 4d. But we know that a + b + c + d = 10, so a + 2b + 3c + 4d = (a + b + c + d) + b + 2c + 3d = 10 + b + 2c + 3d. But we don't know the value of b + 2c + 3d. Hmm, this seems tricky. Maybe this approach isn't straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the method of scaling. Suppose we have the product ab²c³d⁴. Let me take the natural logarithm to turn the product into a sum, which might be easier to handle. Let’s set f(a,b,c,d) = ln(ab²c³d⁴) = ln(a) + 2 ln(b) + 3 ln(c) + 4 ln(d). Then, we can maximize this function subject to a + b + c + d =10. Using Lagrange multipliers here as well, but since we already did that earlier and found the critical point, perhaps this is redundant.

Alternatively, let's see if the AM-GM inequality can be applied by adjusting the variables. Let me consider variables x, y, z, w such that:

Let’s split the exponents into individual terms. For example:
