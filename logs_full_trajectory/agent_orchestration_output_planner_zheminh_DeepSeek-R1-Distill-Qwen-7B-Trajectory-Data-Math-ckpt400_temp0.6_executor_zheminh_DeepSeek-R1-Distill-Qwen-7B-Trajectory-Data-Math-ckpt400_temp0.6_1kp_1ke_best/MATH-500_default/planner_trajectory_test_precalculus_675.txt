Okay, so I need to find the smallest positive real number C such that for any two-dimensional vector v, the inequality ||Mv|| ≤ C||v|| holds, where M is the matrix [[2, 3], [0, -2]]. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with matrix norms, the operator norm of a matrix is the smallest number C such that the inequality above holds for all vectors v. The operator norm is defined as the maximum of ||Mv|| / ||v|| over all non-zero vectors v. Therefore, the smallest such C is the operator norm of the matrix M. So, my task reduces to computing the operator norm of M.

Now, I recall that for a matrix M, the operator norm (induced by the vector 2-norm, which is the usual Euclidean norm) can be computed as the square root of the largest eigenvalue of M transpose times M. That is, ||M|| = sqrt(max eigenvalue of M^T M). So, maybe I should compute M transpose multiplied by M, then find its eigenvalues, take the largest one, and then square root it.

Let me verify this. The operator norm is indeed the maximum singular value of the matrix, which is the square root of the maximum eigenvalue of M^T M. Since the singular values are the square roots of the eigenvalues of M^T M, the largest singular value is the operator norm.
So, yes, that approach should work.

Let me compute M transpose first. The original matrix M is:

<prompt_1.1> Compute the transpose of the matrix M and then compute M transpose multiplied by M. </prompt_1.1>
-----

Alternatively, is there another way to approach this problem without using the singular value decomposition? Maybe by considering the ratio ||Mv|| / ||v|| and maximizing it over all v?

Let me try that approach as a verification.

Let v be a vector (x, y)^T. Then, Mv is (2x + 3y, -2y)^T. The norm squared of Mv is (2x + 3y)^2 + (-2y)^2 = (4x² + 12xy + 9y²) + 4y² = 4x² + 12xy + 13y². The norm squared of v is x² + y². So, the ratio squared is (4x² + 12xy + 13y²)/(x² + y²). Let me denote this ratio squared as R. So,

R = (4x² + 12xy + 13y²)/(x² + y²).

We need to find the maximum value of R, which will be the square of the operator norm. Let me set t = y/x, assuming x ≠ 0. Then, substituting y = tx, we have:

<prompt_1.2> Substitute y = tx and simplify the expression for R. </prompt_1.2>
-----

Alternatively, if I didn't remember the singular value decomposition, but knew that the maximum ratio ||Mv|| / ||v|| is achieved when v is the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of M^T M, then perhaps we could approach it that way.

<prompt_1.3> Consider an alternative method using eigenvalues of M transpose M. </prompt_1.3>

Alternatively, if I parametrize the unit circle and maximize the function f(x,y) = 4x² +12xy +13y² subject to x² + y² =1. This is a constrained optimization problem, which can be solved using Lagrange multipliers.

<prompt_1.4> Use Lagrange multipliers to maximize the function f(x,y) subject to the constraint. </prompt_1.4>

Row 1: 2, 3
Row 2: 0, -2

Therefore, M transpose (M^T) is:

Row 1: 2, 0
Row 2: 3, -2

So, M^T is [[2, 0], [3, -2]]. Now, let's compute M^T multiplied by M.

Multiplying M^T and M:

First element (1,1): (2)(2) + (0)(0) = 4 + 0 = 4
Element (1,2): (2)(3) + (0)(-2) = 6 + 0 = 6
Element (2,1): (3)(2) + (-2)(0) = 6 + 0 = 6
Element (2,2): (3)(3) + (-2)(-2) = 9 + 4 = 13

So, M^T M is the matrix:
[[4, 6],
[6, 13]]

<execution_1.2>
R = (4t² + 12t + 13)/(1 + t²).

Now, let me define f(t) = (4t² + 12t + 13)/(1 + t²). To find the maximum of f(t), take derivative with respect to t and set to zero.

Compute f’(t):

Using quotient rule: [ (8t + 12)(1 + t²) - (4t² + 12t +13)(2t) ] / (1 + t²)^2.

Simplify numerator:

(8t +12)(1 + t²) = 8t(1) +8t(t²) +12(1) +12(t²) =8t + 8t³ +12 +12t².

(4t² +12t +13)(2t) =8t³ +24t² +26t.

Subtract the second expression from the first:

[8t +8t³ +12 +12t²] - [8t³ +24t² +26t] =8t +8t³ +12 +12t² -8t³ -24t² -26t = (8t -26t) + (8t³ -8t³) + (12t² -24t²) +12 = (-18t) -12t² +12.

So numerator is -12t² -18t +12. Factor out -6: -6(2t² +3t -2).

Set numerator equal to zero: -6(2t² +3t -2) =0 => 2t² +3t -2=0.

Solve quadratic equation: t = [-3 ± sqrt(9 +16)] /4 = [-3 ±5]/4. So, roots are (2)/4=0.5 and (-8)/4=-2. So, t=0.5 and t=-2.

Therefore, critical points at t=0.5 and t=-2. Let's evaluate f(t) at these points.

First, t=0.5:

f(0.5) = (4*(0.25) +12*(0.5) +13)/(1 +0.25) = (1 +6 +13)/1.25 =20/1.25=16.

Next, t=-2:

f(-2) = (4*4 +12*(-2) +13)/(1 +4) = (16 -24 +13)/5=5/5=1.

Also check the limit as t approaches infinity: f(t) ~4t² / t²=4. So, the function tends to 4 at infinity. So the maximum value is 16 at t=0.5, and the minimum is 1 at t=-2. Therefore, the maximum ratio R is 16, so the maximum ||Mv|| / ||v|| is sqrt(16)=4. Hence, the operator norm is 4, so the smallest C is 4.

<execution_1.3>
Wait, but that's essentially the same as the singular value decomposition approach. Because the eigenvalues of M^T M correspond to the squares of the singular values. So, the maximum eigenvalue of M^T M is the square of the largest singular value, which is the square of the operator norm. Therefore, taking the square root gives the operator norm.

But perhaps I can explain it in another way. Let's see. Suppose we write the ratio ||Mv||^2 / ||v||^2. Expanding this, as I did before, gives (4x² +12xy +13y²)/(x² + y²). Let me denote this ratio as R. To find its maximum, I can set up the equation using Lagrange multipliers, as I did earlier, or substitute y = tx and find the maximum over t. Either way, we end up with the same quadratic equation.

Alternatively, if I consider that R is a quadratic form, and quadratic forms can be analyzed using eigenvalues. The maximum value of R is the largest eigenvalue of the matrix associated with the quadratic form. In this case, the quadratic form is [4, 6; 6, 13], right? Because 4x² +12xy +13y² can be written as [x y] * [[4,6],[6,13]] * [x; y]. Therefore, the maximum eigenvalue of this matrix will be the maximum value of R, and hence the square of the operator norm. Taking the square root gives the operator norm.

So, let's compute the eigenvalues of the matrix [[4,6],[6,13]]. The characteristic equation is det([[4 - λ, 6],[6, 13 - λ]]) = 0. So,

(4 - λ)(13 - λ) - 36 = 0

Expanding this:

4*13 -4λ -13λ + λ² -36 = 0

52 -17λ + λ² -36 = 0

λ² -17λ +16 =0

Quadratic equation: λ² -17λ +16=0. Solving:

λ = [17 ± sqrt(289 -64)] /2 = [17 ± sqrt(225)] /2 = [17 ±15]/2

Thus, λ = (17 +15)/2=32/2=16, and λ=(17-15)/2=2/2=1. Therefore, the eigenvalues are 16 and 1. Therefore, the maximum eigenvalue is 16, so the maximum R is 16, hence the maximum ||Mv||^2 / ||v||^2 is 16, so the maximum ||Mv|| / ||v|| is 4. Therefore, C=4.
</execution_1.3>

<execution_1.4>
Let’s set up the Lagrangian: L = 4x² +12xy +13y² - λ(x² + y² -1). Taking partial derivatives:

∂L/∂x = 8x +12y - 2λx = 0

∂L/∂y =12x +26y - 2λy = 0

∂L/∂λ = -(x² + y² -1) = 0

So, from the first equation: (8 - 2λ)x +12y =0

Second equation:12x + (26 - 2λ)y =0

We can write this as a system:

(8 - 2λ)x +12y =0

12x + (26 - 2λ)y =0

For non-trivial solutions, the determinant of the coefficients must be zero:

|8 -2λ   12    |

|12  26 -2λ|  =0

Calculating determinant:

(8 -2λ)(26 -2λ) -12*12 =0

Expand (8 -2λ)(26 -2λ):

8*26 -8*2λ -26*2λ +4λ² = 208 -16λ -52λ +4λ² =208 -68λ +4λ²

Subtract 144:

208 -68λ +4λ² -144 =64 -68λ +4λ²=0

Divide equation by 4:

16 -17λ +λ²=0

So, λ² -17λ +16=0

Solving quadratic equation:

λ = [17 ± sqrt(289 -64)]/2 = [17 ± sqrt(225)]/2 = [17 ±15]/2

Thus, λ = (17 +15)/2=32/2=16, and λ=(17-15)/2=2/2=1.

So, the eigenvalues are 16 and 1. Therefore, the maximum value of R is 16, so the maximum ratio ||Mv|| / ||v|| is sqrt(16)=4. Therefore, C=4.

The matrix M^T M is:

[4, 6]
[6, 13]

So, the characteristic equation is:

(4 - λ)(13 - λ) - 36 = 0

Expanding this:

4*13 - 4λ - 13λ + λ² - 36 = 0

Wait, 4*13 is 52, then -4λ -13λ is -17λ, then +λ², and -36. So:

λ² -17λ +52 -36 = λ² -17λ +16 = 0

So, the quadratic equation is λ² -17λ +16 = 0.

Solving for λ using the quadratic formula:

λ = [17 ± sqrt( (17)^2 - 4*1*16 )]/2 = [17 ± sqrt(289 - 64)]/2 = [17 ± sqrt(225)]/2 = [17 ±15]/2

Therefore, the eigenvalues are (17 +15)/2 = 32/2 = 16 and (17 -15)/2 = 2/2 = 1.

Earlier, I found the eigenvalues of M^T M to be 16 and 1. So, the maximum eigenvalue is 16, hence the operator norm is sqrt(16)=4. That's the same result as the ratio approach. So, both methods confirm that the maximum ratio is 4, hence C=4.

Based on execution_1.3:
Wait, but let me verify this. If the matrix M is upper triangular, with 2 and -2 on the diagonal, then its eigenvalues are 2 and -2. But how does that relate to the operator norm? Wait, the operator norm isn't just the maximum absolute value of the eigenvalues, because the operator norm depends on the matrix norm, not on the spectral radius (which is the maximum absolute eigenvalue) unless the matrix is normal.

<prompt_3.1> Analyze the relationship between the operator norm and the eigenvalues of the matrix. </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
But in this case, is M a normal matrix? A matrix is normal if it commutes with its conjugate transpose, i.e., M M^T = M^T M. Let's check:

First, compute M M^T:

M is [[2,3],[0,-2]], M^T is [[2,0],[3,-2]]. So,

M M^T = [[2*2 + 3*3, 2*0 +3*(-2)], [0*2 + (-2)*3, 0*0 + (-2)*(-2)]]
= [[4 +9, 0 -6], [0 -6, 0 +4]]
= [[13, -6], [-6, 4]]

Compare with M^T M, which we already computed as [[4,6],[6,13]]. So, M M^T is [[13, -6], [-6,4]], which is different from M^T M. Therefore, M is not normal. Therefore, the operator norm is not equal to the spectral radius (maximum absolute eigenvalue). Therefore, in this case, the operator norm is the square root of the maximum eigenvalue of M^T M, which is 4, as we found. So, even though the eigenvalues of M are 2 and -2, the operator norm is different because the matrix is not normal.
</execution_3.1>
</Execution_3>

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
Alternatively, if M were normal, then the operator norm would be the maximum of the absolute values of its eigenvalues. But since M is not normal here, we can't use that shortcut. So, it's important that we checked whether the matrix is normal or not. Since it's not, we have to compute the eigenvalues of M^T M.

Therefore, putting it all together:

1. Compute M^T M.
2. Find eigenvalues of M^T M.
3. Take the square root of the largest eigenvalue.
4. That gives the operator norm, which is the minimal C.

So, steps 1 and 2 give us the eigenvalues, step 3 gives the norm.

Just to recap:

M^T M = [[4,6],[6,13]], eigenvalues 16 and 1. sqrt(16)=4. Therefore, C=4.

Alternatively, through the ratio approach, we found that the maximum of ||Mv||^2 / ||v||^2 is 16, so sqrt(16)=4. So, same result.

Therefore, the answer is 4.

<Plan_5>
Based on execution_4.1:
But let me just check once more with a specific vector. Suppose we take v=(1,0.5). Then, Mv = [2*1 +3*0.5, 0*1 + (-2)*0.5]^T = [2 +1.5, -1]^T = [3.5, -1]^T. The norm squared is 3.5² + (-1)^2 =12.25 +1=13.25. The norm of v is sqrt(1² +0.5²)=sqrt(1.25). So, the ratio squared is 13.25 /1.25=10.6, which is less than 16. So, not the maximum.

Another test vector: v=(1, 0.5). Wait, already did that.

Wait, t=0.5 gives the ratio 16. Let me check v=(2,1). Then, Mv = [2*2 +3*1, 0*2 + (-2)*1]^T = [4 +3, -2]^T = [7, -2]^T. Norm squared is 49 +4=53. Norm of v is sqrt(4 +1)=sqrt(5). So, ratio squared is 53/5=10.6, same as before. So, not the maximum.

If we take the vector that gives the maximum ratio, which is when y =0.5 x. So, if x=1, y=0.5, which is the vector (1,0.5). Wait, but in that case, the ratio squared was 10.6, which is 53/5. Wait, that's inconsistent. Wait, no. Wait, if t=0.5, then in the previous substitution, we had t=y/x=0.5, so y=0.5 x. So, for x=2, y=1. Then, vector (2,1). Then, ||Mv||^2 / ||v||^2 = (4*(2)^2 +12*(2)*(1) +13*(1)^2)/(4 +1) = (16 +24 +13)/5=53/5=10.6. Wait, but earlier, when we computed f(t)=16 at t=0.5. Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, no, wait. Wait, when we set t=y/x=0.5, then the ratio squared is (4*(0.5)^2 +12*(0.5) +13)/ (1 + (0.5)^2). Wait, no, actually, when we set t=y/x, then the ratio squared is (4t² +12t +13)/(1 +t²). So, plugging t=0.5:

(4*(0.25) +12*(0.5) +13)/(1 +0.25) = (1 +6 +13)/1.25=20/1.25=16. So, that's 16. But when we plug in the vector (2,1), which corresponds to t=0.5, we get 53/5=10.6, which is 16? Wait, 53/5 is 10.6, but 16 is 16. That discrepancy suggests a mistake.

Wait, hold on. There must be a miscalculation here. Let me check again.
