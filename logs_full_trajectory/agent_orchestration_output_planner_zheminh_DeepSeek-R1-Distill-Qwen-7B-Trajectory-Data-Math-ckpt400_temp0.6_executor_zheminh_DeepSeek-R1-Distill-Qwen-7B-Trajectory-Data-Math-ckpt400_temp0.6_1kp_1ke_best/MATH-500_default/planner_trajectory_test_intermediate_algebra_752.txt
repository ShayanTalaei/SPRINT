Okay, so I need to find the value of this product of logarithms: log base 2 of 3 multiplied by log base 3 of 4, and so on, up to log base 7 of 8. Hmm, let me write that down to visualize it better: log₂3 × log₃4 × log₄5 × log₅6 × log₆7 × log₇8.

First, I remember that when you have a product of logarithms with different bases, there might be a way to simplify them using logarithm properties. Maybe the change of base formula? Let me recall that formula: log_b a = (ln a)/(ln b) or log_b a = (log_c a)/(log_c b) for any positive c ≠ 1. So if I apply this to each term, perhaps the denominators and numerators will cancel out in some way.

Let me try converting each logarithm using the change of base formula with natural logarithms. So, log₂3 is (ln3)/(ln2), log₃4 is (ln4)/(ln3), and so on. If I write out the entire product, it would be:

(ln3/ln2) × (ln4/ln3) × (ln5/ln4) × (ln6/ln5) × (ln7/ln6) × (ln8/ln7)

Wait a second, when I write them all out, each numerator after the first term cancels with the denominator of the next term.

Let me check:

The first term is ln3/ln2, then the second is ln4/ln3. The ln3 in the numerator cancels with the ln3 in the denominator. Similarly, the ln4 in the numerator cancels with the ln4 in the denominator of the next term, and this pattern continues all the way to the end. So, everything cancels except the very first denominator and the very last numerator.

So, after cancellation, we're left with ln8 divided by ln2.

Based on execution_1.1:
Now, ln8 is the natural log of 8, and ln2 is the natural log of 2. So, the product simplifies to ln8 / ln2. But ln8 can be written as ln(2^3), which is 3*ln2. So substituting that in, we have 3*ln2 / ln2, which simplifies to 3.

Wait, let me verify that again. The original product is log₂3 * log₃4 * ... * log_78. Each consecutive log's base is the previous argument. So, starting with base 2, then 3, up to 7, and the arguments go 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So each time, the base of the next log is the previous argument, which allows the chain of cancellation.
So, yes, all the intermediate terms cancel out, leaving log₂8.

<prompt_2.1> Verify the cancellation and calculate log base 2 of 8 as per the above plan. </prompt_2.1>

But let me think if there's another way to approach this, maybe using the property that log_a b * log_b c = log_a c. Wait, that's another chain of two logs. So, if you have log_a b * log_b c = log_a c. So maybe this product of multiple logs can be telescoped step by step.

<prompt_2.2> Explore an alternative method using the property log_a b * log_b c = log_a c as per the above plan. </prompt_2.2>

<execution_2.1>
Because log_78 is the last term. So, log₂8 is equal to 3, since 2^3 = 8. Therefore, the entire product is 3.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Let me try that.

Starting with log₂3 * log₃4. Using the property, this would be log₂4. Then, multiplying by log₄5, we get log₂4 * log₄5 = log₂5. Then, multiplying by log₅6 gives log₂6. Next, multiplying by log₆7 gives log₂7. Finally, multiplying by log₇8 gives log₂8. And log₂8 is log₂(2^3) = 3. So that's another way to see it, step by step telescoping each time.

Based on execution_2.1:
But let me check with actual numbers to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

<prompt_3.1> Verify the result using actual numerical values as per the above plan. </prompt_3.1>

Based on execution_2.2:
So both methods lead to the same answer, 3. Therefore, I think the answer is 3.
I don't see any mistakes in either approach. The cancellation method and the telescoping product method both result in log₂8, which is 3. So, the value of the given expression is 3.

For example, let's compute each logarithm approximately:

log₂3 ≈ 1.58496
log₃4 ≈ 1.26186
log₄5 ≈ 1.16096
log₅6 ≈ 1.11328
log₆7 ≈ 1.08603
log₇8 ≈ 1.0584

Multiplying all these together:

1.58496 × 1.26186 ≈ 2.0
2.0 × 1.16096 ≈ 2.3219
2.3219 × 1.11328 ≈ 2.585
2.585 × 1.08603 ≈ 2.817
2.817 × 1.0584 ≈ 2.985, which is approximately 3.

Therefore, the value of the given expression is $\boxed{3}$.
