Okay, so I need to solve the equation sin(arctan(x) + arccot(1/x)) = 1/3. Hmm, let's start by understanding what each part of this equation means. 

First, arctan(x) is the angle whose tangent is x. Similarly, arccot(1/x) is the angle whose cotangent is 1/x. Since cotangent is the reciprocal of tangent, arccot(1/x) should be the same as arctan(x), right? Wait, no, actually, arccot(z) is the angle whose cotangent is z, which is the same as arctan(1/z). So arccot(1/x) would be arctan(x). Wait, let me check that.
If θ = arccot(1/x), then cot(θ) = 1/x, which means tan(θ) = x/1 = x, so θ = arctan(x). So yes, arccot(1/x) = arctan(x). So that simplifies the expression inside the sine function to arctan(x) + arctan(x) = 2 arctan(x). So the equation becomes sin(2 arctan(x)) = 1/3.

Wait, is that correct? Let me confirm.

<prompt_1.1> Verify the simplification of the equation inside the sine function. </prompt_1.1>

So now, I need to compute sin(2 arctan(x)) and set it equal to 1/3. There's a double-angle formula for sine: sin(2θ) = 2 sinθ cosθ. Let's let θ = arctan(x). Then sin(2θ) = 2 sinθ cosθ. So I need to find sin(arctan(x)) and cos(arctan(x)).

Let's consider a right triangle where θ = arctan(x).

<prompt_1.2> Calculate sin(2 arctan(x)) using the double-angle formula and trigonometric identities. </prompt_1.2>
-----

But wait, let me think again. The original equation is sin(arctan(x) + arccot(1/x)) = 1/3. But since arccot(1/x) is arctan(x), so the sum is 2 arctan(x). However, is there any restriction on the domain of arccot(1/x)? The range of arccot(1/x) is (0, π), right?

If x is positive, then arccot(1/x) is arctan(x). But what if x is negative? Let's think. Suppose x is negative. Then 1/x is also negative. The range of arccot is (0, π), right? Because arccotangent is typically defined as the inverse function with range (0, π) excluding the asymptotes. Wait, no, actually, the range of arccot(z) is (0, π) for real numbers, but depending on the convention. Wait, maybe I should check. 

Wait, in many textbooks, arctan(x) has a range of (-π/2, π/2), and arccot(x) has a range of (0, π). So if x is positive, arccot(1/x) is arctan(x). But if x is negative, arccot(1/x) is π + arctan(x), because 1/x is negative, and arccot(z) for negative z would be in (π/2, π), which is π + arctan(z). Wait, no, arccot(z) for negative z would be π - arctan(|z|). Let me verify. 

Suppose z is negative. Let’s say z = -a where a > 0. Then arccot(z) is the angle θ in (0, π) such that cotθ = z = -a. Since cotθ = cosθ/sinθ, so if cotθ is negative, then cosθ and sinθ have opposite signs. So θ is in (π/2, π). Let’s let θ = π - arctan(a). Then cot(π - arctan(a)) = -cot(arctan(a)) = -a. So yes, arccot(-a) = π - arctan(a). Therefore, if x is negative, arccot(1/x) = arccot(-|1/x|) = π - arctan(|1/x|) = π - arctan(-1/x). Wait, but arctan(-1/x) is -arctan(1/x), but since arccot is positive, maybe it's π - arctan(1/|x|). Hmm, this is getting confusing. Let's take a step back.
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
In this triangle, the opposite side is x, adjacent is 1, so hypotenuse is sqrt(x² + 1). Therefore, sinθ = x / sqrt(x² + 1) and cosθ = 1 / sqrt(x² + 1). Therefore, sin(2θ) = 2 * (x / sqrt(x² + 1)) * (1 / sqrt(x² + 1)) = 2x / (x² + 1). So the equation becomes 2x / (x² + 1) = 1/3.
</execution_1.2>

<execution_1.3>
Similarly, arctan(x) has a range of (-π/2, π/2). But since arccot(1/x) is always between 0 and π, except when x=0, but x can't be zero here because arccot(1/0) is undefined. Wait, x can't be zero because 1/x would be undefined. So x must be non-zero. So θ = arctan(x) is between -π/2 and π/2, but arccot(1/x) is between 0 and π. So when we add them, the argument of the sine function is between -π/2 + 0 and π/2 + π, so between -π/2 and 3π/2. But sine is periodic with period 2π, so sin(α) = sin(α + 2πn). But since the range of arctan(x) is (-π/2, π/2) and arccot(1/x) is (0, π), their sum is between -π/2 and 3π/2. However, the original equation is sin(something) = 1/3, which is positive. So the something must be in a region where sine is positive, which is first and second quadrants, i.e., between 0 and π. But since the sum can go up to 3π/2, but sine of angles between π and 3π/2 is negative, so maybe the sum must actually be between 0 and π? Wait, but arctan(x) can be negative. If x is negative, arctan(x) is negative, and arccot(1/x) is positive because 1/x is negative, so arccot(1/x) would be in (π/2, π) maybe? Wait, no. Let me think. 

Wait, the range of arccot(z) is (0, π) excluding π/2, right? So if z is positive, arccot(z) is in (0, π/2), and if z is negative, arccot(z) is in (π/2, π). So if x is positive, then 1/x is positive, so arccot(1/x) is in (0, π/2). So arctan(x) is in (0, π/2), so the sum is in (0, π). If x is negative, 1/x is negative, so arccot(1/x) is in (π/2, π). And arctan(x) is in (-π/2, 0). So the sum would be in (π/2 - π/2, π + π/2) = (-π/2, 3π/2). Wait, but if x is negative, arctan(x) is negative, and arccot(1/x) is in (π/2, π). So their sum could be in (π/2 - π/2, π + π/2) which is (0, π). Wait, no. If x is negative, arctan(x) is between -π/2 and 0, and arccot(1/x) is between π/2 and π. So their sum is between -π/2 + π/2 = 0 and 0 + π = π. So regardless of x being positive or negative, the sum arctan(x) + arccot(1/x) is between 0 and π. Therefore, the argument of the sine function is in [0, π], which is exactly where sine is non-negative. So that's consistent with the equation sin(something) = 1/3, which is positive.

So solving 2x / (x² + 1) = 1/3. Let's do that. Multiply both sides by (x² + 1):

Quadratic equation: x² - 6x + 1 = 0. Using the quadratic formula, x = [6 ± sqrt(36 - 4*1*1)] / 2 = [6 ± sqrt(32)] / 2 = [6 ± 4*sqrt(2)] / 2 = 3 ± 2*sqrt(2).

Therefore, the solutions are x = 3 + 2√2 and x = 3 - 2√2. Let's check if these are valid.

<prompt_3.1> Verify the solutions 3 + 2√2 and 3 - 2√2 in the context of the original equation. </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
First, 3 + 2√2 is approximately 3 + 2.828 = 5.828, which is positive. 3 - 2√2 is approximately 3 - 2.828 = 0.172, which is positive as well. Wait, but x could be negative. Wait, but according to earlier analysis, even if x is negative, the sum arctan(x) + arccot(1/x) is between 0 and π. However, when we derived the equation 2x / (x² + 1) = 1/3, we assumed that arccot(1/x) = arctan(x). But if x is negative, arccot(1/x) is not equal to arctan(x). Wait, that's a problem. Because if x is negative, arccot(1/x) is arccot(negative) which is in (π/2, π), while arctan(x) is negative. So the sum would be arctan(x) + arccot(1/x) = negative + something in (π/2, π). Depending on the magnitude, the sum could be in (π/2 - π/2, π + 0) = (0, π). But when we derived 2x / (x² + 1) = 1/3, we used the identity that arccot(1/x) = arctan(x), which is only true when x is positive. So for negative x, this identity does not hold. Therefore, our derivation of the equation 2x / (x² + 1) = 1/3 is only valid when arccot(1/x) = arctan(x), which is when x is positive. So if x is negative, we need to handle it separately.
</execution_3.1>
</Execution_3>

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
Let me check. Suppose x is negative. Let x = -a where a > 0. Then 1/x = -1/a. Then arccot(1/x) = arccot(-1/a). Since arccot is in (0, π), arccot(-1/a) = π - arccot(1/a). Because cot(π - θ) = -cotθ. So arccot(-1/a) = π - arctan(a). Therefore, arccot(1/x) = π - arctan(a) when x is negative. So the sum arctan(x) + arccot(1/x) becomes arctan(-a) + π - arctan(a). Since arctan is odd, arctan(-a) = -arctan(a). So the sum is -arctan(a) + π - arctan(a) = π - 2 arctan(a). Therefore, sin(π - 2 arctan(a)) = sin(2 arctan(a)) because sin(π - θ) = sinθ. Therefore, sin(arctan(x) + arccot(1/x)) = sin(2 arctan(a)) when x is negative. But since x = -a, then a = -x. So sin(2 arctan(-x)). But since x is negative, -x is positive.

So in both cases, whether x is positive or negative, sin(arctan(x) + arccot(1/x)) = 2x / (x² + 1) when x is positive, and 2*(-x) / (x² + 1) when x is negative? Wait, no. Wait, when x is negative, the sum is π - 2 arctan(a), and sin(π - 2 arctan(a)) = sin(2 arctan(a)). But 2 arctan(a) is the same as 2 arctan(-x) since a = -x. But 2 arctan(-x) = -2 arctan(x). But sin(-θ) = -sinθ. Therefore, sin(2 arctan(a)) = sin(-2 arctan(x)) = -sin(2 arctan(x)). But wait, this seems conflicting with the previous result.

Wait, maybe I need to approach this more carefully. Let's re-examine.

<prompt_4.1> Re-evaluate the expression sin(arctan(x) + arccot(1/x)) for both positive and negative x. </prompt_4.1>
-----

But wait, let's check the original equation with x = 3 - 2√2. Let's compute arctan(x) + arccot(1/x). Since x is positive (≈0.172), arccot(1/x) = arctan(x). So the sum is 2 arctan(x). Then sin(2 arctan(x)) = 2x/(x² + 1). Let's compute x² + 1: (3 - 2√2)^2 + 1 = 9 - 12√2 + 8 + 1 = 18 - 12√2. Then 2x/(x² + 1) = 2*(3 - 2√2)/(18 - 12√2) = [6 - 4√2]/[6*(3 - 2√2)] = [6 - 4√2]/[6*(3 - 2√2)]. Factor numerator and denominator: numerator is 2*(3 - 2√2), denominator is 6*(3 - 2√2). So cancels to 2/6 = 1/3. Correct.

Similarly for x = 3 + 2√2, same steps apply. So both solutions are valid.

**Final Answer**
The solutions are \(\boxed{3 + 2\sqrt{2}}\) and \(\boxed{3 - 2\sqrt{2}}\).

If x is negative, let x = -a, a > 0. Then arctan(x) = - arctan(a). arccot(1/x) = arccot(-1/a) = π - arccot(1/a) = π - arctan(a). So the sum is - arctan(a) + π - arctan(a) = π - 2 arctan(a). Then sin(π - 2 arctan(a)) = sin(2 arctan(a)) because sin(π - θ) = sinθ. So sin(2 arctan(a)) = 2 sin(arctan(a)) cos(arctan(a)). For arctan(a), the triangle has opposite side a, adjacent 1, hypotenuse sqrt(a² + 1). So sin(arctan(a)) = a / sqrt(a² + 1), cos = 1 / sqrt(a² + 1). So sin(2 arctan(a)) = 2a / (a² + 1). Since a = -x, because x = -a, then sin(2 arctan(a)) = 2*(-x) / (x² + 1). Wait, but x is negative here. So 2a / (a² + 1) = 2*(-x) / (x² + 1). But since a = -x, then a² = x². Therefore, sin(π - 2 arctan(a)) = 2a / (a² + 1) = 2*(-x) / (x² + 1). But since x is negative, -x is positive. So in this case, sin(arctan(x) + arccot(1/x)) = 2*(-x)/(x² + 1). But in the original equation, sin(something) = 1/3, which is positive. So 2*(-x)/(x² + 1) = 1/3. Therefore, for x negative, the equation becomes 2*(-x)/(x² + 1) = 1/3. So solving for x negative, 2*(-x)/(x² + 1) = 1/3.

But let's check if the solutions we found are positive. The solutions were x = 3 ± 2√2. 3 + 2√2 is positive, and 3 - 2√2 is approximately 3 - 2.828 ≈ 0.172, which is positive. So both solutions are positive. Therefore, even though we considered x negative in the second case, the quadratic equation only gives positive roots.
So does that mean that there are no negative solutions?

If x is negative, then solving 2*(-x)/(x² + 1) = 1/3. Let me denote y = -x, where y > 0. Then equation becomes 2y / (y² + 1) = 1/3, which is the same equation as before. So solving 2y / (y² + 1) = 1/3, which gives y = 3 ± 2√2. But since y = -x > 0, then x = -y. So the solutions for x would be x = - (3 + 2√2) and x = - (3 - 2√2). But 3 - 2√2 is positive (≈0.172), so x = - (3 - 2√2) is negative. However, earlier when we solved the equation 2x / (x² + 1) = 1/3, we got x = 3 ± 2√2, which are both positive. So if we consider x negative, solving 2*(-x)/(x² + 1) = 1/3 would lead to x = - (3 ± 2√2). But we need to check if these negative x satisfy the original equation.

Since x is negative, 1/x is negative. arctan(x) is negative, arccot(1/x) is in (π/2, π). So their sum is arctan(x) + arccot(1/x) = negative + (π/2 to π). Let's compute arctan(x) + arccot(1/x) when x is negative. Let x = -a, a > 0. Then arctan(x) = - arctan(a). arccot(1/x) = arccot(-1/a) = π - arctan(a). So sum is - arctan(a) + π - arctan(a) = π - 2 arctan(a). Then sin(π - 2 arctan(a)) = sin(2 arctan(a)) as before. Then sin(2 arctan(a)) = 2a / (a² + 1). But a = -x, so 2*(-x) / (x² + 1). But x is negative here, so 2*(-x) is positive. So sin(arctan(x) + arccot(1/x)) = 2*(-x)/(x² + 1). So if we set this equal to 1/3, then 2*(-x)/(x² + 1) = 1/3. Let y = -x > 0. Then 2y/(y² + 1) = 1/3. Solving this gives y = 3 ± 2√2. But since y = -x, x = -y = - (3 ± 2√2). However, we need to check if these negative solutions are valid. Let's check x = - (3 + 2√2). Let's compute sin(arctan(x) + arccot(1/x)). As above, this should be 2*(-x)/(x² + 1). Let's compute:

x = - (3 + 2√2)

Then -x = 3 + 2√2

x² = (3 + 2√2)^2 = 9 + 12√2 + 8 = 17 + 12√2

x² + 1 = 18 + 12√2

2*(-x)/(x² + 1) = 2*(3 + 2√2)/(18 + 12√2) = [6 + 4√2]/[18 + 12√2] = factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 2*(3 + 2√2)

Denominator: 6*(3 + 2√2)

So the ratio is 2/6 = 1/3. Therefore, sin(arctan(x) + arccot(1/x)) = 1/3. So x = - (3 + 2√2) is a solution.

Similarly, check x = - (3 - 2√2). Then -x = 3 - 2√2.

Compute 2*(-x)/(x² + 1):

x = - (3 - 2√2)

x² = (3 - 2√2)^2 = 9 - 12√2 + 8 = 17 - 12√2

x² + 1 = 18 - 12√2

2*(-x)/(x² + 1) = 2*(3 - 2√2)/(18 - 12√2) = [6 - 4√2]/[18 - 12√2] = factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 2*(3 - 2√2)

Denominator: 6*(3 - 2√2)

Ratio: 2/6 = 1/3. So this also satisfies the equation. Therefore, x = - (3 ± 2√2) are also solutions.

2√2 ≈ 2.828, so 3 - 2.828 ≈ 0.172, which is positive. So -3 + 2√2 ≈ -3 + 2.828 ≈ -0.172, which is negative. Therefore, x = - (3 - 2√2) = -3 + 2√2. So the four solutions are:

x = 3 + 2√2,

x = 3 - 2√2,

x = -3 - 2√2,

x = -3 + 2√2.

But let's verify x = -3 + 2√2. Wait, x = -3 + 2√2 ≈ -3 + 2.828 ≈ -0.172. Let's compute sin(arctan(x) + arccot(1/x)).

Since x is negative, 1/x is negative. arctan(x) is arctan(-0.172) ≈ -0.171 radians. arccot(1/x) = arccot(-5.828). Since arccot(z) for negative z is π - arccot(|z|). arccot(5.828) is arctan(1/5.828) ≈ 0.171 radians. Therefore, arccot(-5.828) = π - 0.171 ≈ 3.1416 - 0.171 ≈ 2.9706 radians. Then the sum is -0.171 + 2.9706 ≈ 2.8 radians. sin(2.8) ≈ sin(π - 0.341) ≈ sin(0.341) ≈ 0.334, which is approximately 1/3 (0.333...). So it checks out. Similarly, x = -3 - 2√2 ≈ -5.828. Let's check:

x = -5.828

arctan(x) ≈ arctan(-5.828) ≈ -1.396 radians (since tan(-1.396) ≈ -tan(1.396) ≈ -5.828)

arccot(1/x) = arccot(-0.172). Since 1/x ≈ -0.172, arccot(-0.172) = π - arccot(0.172). arccot(0.172) = arctan(1/0.172) ≈ arctan(5.814) ≈ 1.396 radians. Therefore, arccot(-0.172) = π - 1.396 ≈ 3.1416 - 1.396 ≈ 1.7456 radians. Then the sum is -1.396 + 1.7456 ≈ 0.3496 radians. sin(0.3496) ≈ 0.342, which is approximately 1/3. So this also checks out.

But wait, when we solved the equation 2*(-x)/(x² + 1) = 1/3, we set y = -x, leading to 2y/(y² +1) =1/3, which gave y=3±2√2. But since y = -x, then x = -y. So the solutions are x = -(3 + 2√2) and x = -(3 - 2√2). Therefore, the four solutions are:

x = 3 + 2√2,

x = 3 - 2√2,

x = -3 - 2√2,

x = -3 + 2√2.

√2 ≈ 1.414, so 2√2 ≈ 2.828. Therefore:

3 + 2√2 ≈ 5.828,

3 - 2√2 ≈ 0.172,

-3 - 2√2 ≈ -5.828,

-3 + 2√2 ≈ -3 + 2.828 ≈ -0.172.

So all four solutions are valid: two positive and two negative. However, when we initially derived the equation 2x/(x² +1) =1/3, we considered x positive, leading to solutions 3 ± 2√2. Then, considering x negative, we derived 2*(-x)/(x² +1)=1/3, leading to solutions x= - (3 ± 2√2). Therefore, all four solutions are valid. However, when we checked x = - (3 - 2√2) ≈ -0.172, it worked. Therefore, all four solutions are valid.

Wait, but let's check x = - (3 + 2√2) ≈ -5.828. Then -x = 5.828, and 2*(-x)/(x² +1) = 2*5.828/(5.828² +1). Let's compute 5.828² ≈ 34, so 34 +1 =35, 2*5.828≈11.656. 11.656/35 ≈0.333, which is 1/3. Correct. Similarly, x = - (3 - 2√2) ≈-0.172, 2*(-x)/(x² +1)=2*0.172/(0.0296 +1)=0.344/1.0296≈0.333, which is 1/3. Correct.

Therefore, all four solutions are valid. Therefore, the solutions are x=3±2√2 and x= -3±2√2. Wait, but 3±2√2 are two solutions, and -3±2√2 are another two solutions. So total four solutions. But let me check if all four are distinct. 3 + 2√2 ≈5.828, 3 - 2√2≈0.172, -3 + 2√2≈-0.172, -3 -2√2≈-5.828. Yes, all four are distinct.

Wait, but when we solved the equation 2x/(x² +1)=1/3 for x positive, we got x=3±2√2. Then for x negative, solving 2*(-x)/(x² +1)=1/3, which is same as 2y/(y² +1)=1/3 where y=-x>0, gives y=3±2√2, so x= -y= -3±2√2. Therefore, the four solutions are indeed x=3+2√2, x=3-2√2, x=-3-2√2, x=-3+2√2. However, 3-2√2 is positive, so -3+2√2 is negative (≈-0.172). Therefore, all four solutions are distinct.

x² = (3)^2 + 2*3*2√2 + (2√2)^2 = 9 + 12√2 + 8 = 17 + 12√2,

x² +1 = 18 + 12√2,

2x = 2*(3 + 2√2) = 6 + 4√2,

So 2x/(x² +1) = (6 + 4√2)/(18 + 12√2) = [2*(3 + 2√2)]/[6*(3 + 2√2)] = 2/6 = 1/3. Correct.

Similarly, x = 3 - 2√2:

x² +1 = (3 - 2√2)^2 +1 = 9 -12√2 +8 +1=18 -12√2,

2x = 6 -4√2,

So (6 -4√2)/(18 -12√2) = [2*(3 -2√2)]/[6*(3 -2√2)] = 2/6 =1/3. Correct.

For x = -3 -2√2:

sin(arctan(x) + arccot(1/x)) = sin(π -2 arctan(a)) = sin(2 arctan(a)) = 2a/(a² +1), where a = -x =3 +2√2. So 2*(3 +2√2)/[(3 +2√2)^2 +1] = same as above, which is 1/3. Correct.

For x = -3 +2√2:

a = -x =3 -2√2,

sin(2 arctan(a)) = 2a/(a² +1) = 2*(3 -2√2)/[(3 -2√2)^2 +1] = same as above, 1/3. Correct.

Therefore, all four solutions are valid.

<Plan_10>
Based on execution_9.1:
But wait, the original equation is sin(arctan(x) + arccot(1/x)) =1/3. The range of sin is [-π/2, π/2], but since the right-hand side is 1/3, which is positive, the argument inside sin must be in (0, π). However, when x is negative, arctan(x) + arccot(1/x) = π - 2 arctan(a), which is in (0, π). So all four solutions are valid.
