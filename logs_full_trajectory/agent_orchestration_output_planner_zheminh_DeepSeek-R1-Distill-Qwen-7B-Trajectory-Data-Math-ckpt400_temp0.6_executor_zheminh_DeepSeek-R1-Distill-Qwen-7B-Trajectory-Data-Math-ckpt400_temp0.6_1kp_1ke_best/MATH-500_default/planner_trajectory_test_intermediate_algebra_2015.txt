Okay, so I need to find the set of three expressions involving the roots of the quartic equation \( x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0 \). The roots are \( \alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4 \), and I need to determine the unordered set containing \( \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 \), \( \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 \), and \( \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 \). Hmm, let's start by recalling some properties of polynomial roots and symmetric functions.

<prompt_1.1> Recall the properties of polynomial roots and symmetric functions relevant to the problem. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
First, since the equation is a quartic (degree 4), there are four roots. The given polynomial is monic (leading coefficient 1), so by Vieta's formulas, the sums and products of the roots can be related to the coefficients of the polynomial. Let me write down Vieta's formulas for a quartic equation \( x^4 + a x^3 + b x^2 + c x + d = 0 \). Then:

- Sum of roots: \( \alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -a \)
- Sum of products of roots two at a time: \( \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = b \)
- Sum of products of roots three at a time: \( \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = -c \)
- Product of roots: \( \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = d \)

In our given equation \( x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0 \), the coefficients are: \( a = 2 \), \( b = 0 \) (since there's no \( x^2 \) term), \( c = 0 \) (since there's no \( x \) term), and \( d = 2 \). So applying Vieta's formulas:

- Sum of roots: \( \alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2 \)
- Sum of products two at a time: \( \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0 \)
- Sum of products three at a time: \( \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0 \)
- Product of roots: \( \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2 \)
</execution_1.1>
</Execution_1>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
But the problem isn't directly asking for these sums. Instead, it's asking for three specific combinations: \( \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 \), \( \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 \), and \( \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 \). These look like the different ways to partition the four roots into two pairs and then take the sum of the products of each pair. Since the roots are unordered, these are the three possible pairings.

For example, if we fix \( \alpha_1 \) and \( \alpha_2 \) as a pair, then the remaining roots \( \alpha_3 \) and \( \alpha_4 \) form the other pair.
Similarly, if we pair \( \alpha_1 \) with \( \alpha_3 \), then \( \alpha_2 \) and \( \alpha_4 \) are paired, and so on. Since there are three ways to partition four distinct elements into two pairs, there are three such sums.

So, the problem is essentially asking for the multiset of these three pairwise product sums. The question is, what are these three values?

Let me denote them as:
- \( S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 \)
- \( S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 \)
- \( S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 \)

We need to find the set \( \{S_1, S_2, S_3\} \).

Now, how can we compute these?

We know from Vieta that the sum of all two-element products is zero: \( S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0 \). Wait, no. Wait, hold on. Let's check.

<prompt_2.1> Verify the relationship between the sums \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \) and the known sums from Vieta's formulas. </prompt_2.1>
-----

But maybe we need to compute these symmetric sums.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider the roots as being paired in some way, and then the products would relate to the roots of a quadratic equation. Let me think. If we can factor the quartic into two quadratics, then the roots of each quadratic would be a pair \( \alpha_i, \alpha_j \), and the products \( \alpha_i\alpha_j \) would be the constants terms of those quadratics. Then, the sum of the constants terms would be one of the S_i's.

<prompt_2.2> Consider factoring the quartic into two quadratics and explore how their roots and coefficients relate to \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \). </prompt_2.2>
-----

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to compute these. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that the sums \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \) are the roots of a cubic equation. Since there are three of them, and their sum is 3u^2 + something?

<prompt_2.3> Consider if the sums \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \) could be roots of a cubic equation and explore this approach. </prompt_2.3>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
The sum \( S_1 + S_2 + S_3 \) would actually be equal to the sum of all two-element products, which is exactly the Vieta's formula for the sum of products two at a time. But in our case, that sum is given as 0. So, \( S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0 \).
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
But wait, the quartic is \( x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0 \). Let me see if it can be factored into two quadratics.

Suppose \( x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = (x^2 + a x + b)(x^2 + c x + d) \). Let's try to factor it. Expanding the right-hand side:

\( x^4 + (a + c)x^3 + (ac + b + d)x^2 + (ad + bc)x + b d \)

Comparing coefficients with the original polynomial \( x^4 + 2x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x + 2 \), we get the system of equations:

1. \( a + c = 2 \) (from the \( x^3 \) term)
2. \( ac + b + d = 0 \) (from the \( x^2 \) term)
3. \( ad + bc = 0 \) (from the \( x \) term)
4. \( b d = 2 \) (from the constant term)

So, we need to solve this system for \( a, b, c, d \). Let's see.

From equation 1: \( c = 2 - a \).

From equation 4: \( b d = 2 \). Since 2 is prime, possible integer pairs (b, d) are (1,2), (2,1), (-1,-2), (-2,-1). Let's try these possibilities.

Let's first try b = 1 and d = 2.

Then equation 3: \( a*2 + (2 - a)*1 = 0 \)

So, 2a + 2 - a = 0 => a + 2 = 0 => a = -2.

Then c = 2 - (-2) = 4.

Check equation 2: \( (-2)(4) + 1 + 2 = -8 + 3 = -5 ≠ 0 \). Not good.

Next, try b = 2 and d = 1.

Equation 3: \( a*1 + (2 - a)*2 = 0 \)

=> a + 4 - 2a = 0 => -a + 4 = 0 => a = 4

Then c = 2 - 4 = -2

Check equation 2: \( 4*(-2) + 2 + 1 = -8 + 3 = -5 ≠ 0 \). Still not good.

Now try b = -1 and d = -2.

Equation 3: \( a*(-2) + (2 - a)*(-1) = 0 \)

=> -2a -2 + a = 0 => -a -2 = 0 => a = -2

Then c = 2 - (-2) = 4

Check equation 2: (-2)(4) + (-1) + (-2) = -8 -3 = -11 ≠ 0.

Next, b = -2 and d = -1.

Equation 3: \( a*(-1) + (2 - a)*(-2) = 0 \)

=> -a -4 + 2a = 0 => a -4 = 0 => a = 4

Then c = 2 -4 = -2

Check equation 2: 4*(-2) + (-2) + (-1) = -8 -3 = -11 ≠0.

Hmm, none of the integer pairs worked. Maybe the polynomial is irreducible over integers, so it can't be factored into quadratics with integer coefficients. Therefore, perhaps this approach isn't helpful here.

Alternatively, maybe the roots can be paired in some other way. Since the quartic is reciprocal? Let me check.

A reciprocal polynomial satisfies \( x^n P(1/x) = P(x) \). Let's check:

Given \( P(x) = x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 \). Then \( x^4 P(1/x) = x^4(1/x^4 + 2/x^3 + 2) = 1 + 2x + 2x^4 \), which is not equal to P(x). So it's not reciprocal. So that idea doesn't help.
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that if we can find the values of \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), then we can find their products and sums. But since we already know their sum is 0, as per Vieta's two at a time sum being 0, but actually no, wait. Wait, Vieta's formula for two at a time is the sum of all \( \alpha_i\alpha_j \), which is 0. But our S1, S2, S3 are three specific pairings. So the sum S1 + S2 + S3 is equal to the sum of all two-element products, which is 0. Therefore, S1 + S2 + S3 = 0.

Additionally, the sum of the products of the three at a time is 0 as well. Wait, but how does that help us?

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
But we need more information. Maybe we can find the sum of the products of the S_i's taken two at a time, or perhaps the product of the S_i's. If we can find those, then we can form a cubic equation whose roots are \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), and thus determine their values.

So let's compute \( S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3 \) and \( S_1 S_2 S_3 \). Then, the cubic equation would be \( t^3 - (S_1 + S_2 + S_3)t^2 + (S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3)t - S_1 S_2 S_3 = 0 \), which simplifies to \( t^3 + (S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3)t - S_1 S_2 S_3 = 0 \) since \( S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0 \).

Let's compute \( S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3 \).

First, note that:

\( S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 \)

\( S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 \)

\( S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 \)

So, \( S_1 S_2 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) \)

Let's expand this product:

<prompt_3.1> Expand and simplify the expression for \( S_1 S_2 \) using the given expressions for \( S_1 \) and \( S_2 \). </prompt_3.1>
-----

Based on execution_2.2:
Alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that the roots come in complex conjugate pairs? Wait, since the coefficients are real, complex roots come in conjugate pairs. But the problem states that the roots are distinct, so maybe there are two real roots and two complex conjugate roots? Let's check.

Simplify each term:

= \( \alpha_1^2 \alpha_2 \alpha_3 + \alpha_1 \alpha_2^2 \alpha_4 + \alpha_1 \alpha_3^2 \alpha_4 + \alpha_2 \alpha_3 \alpha_4^2 \)

Hmm, that seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way to approach this. Alternatively, perhaps consider that \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \) are the roots of a cubic equation whose coefficients can be determined using symmetric sums.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that if we can express \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \) in terms of the roots, then we can find their sums and products. Let's denote \( S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 \), etc. Then, perhaps compute \( S_1 + S_2 + S_3 \), which we know is 0, \( S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3 \), and \( S_1 S_2 S_3 \).
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
Let me see if the equation has real roots. Let's try plugging in x = -1: (-1)^4 + 2*(-1)^3 + 2 = 1 - 2 + 2 = 1 ≠ 0. x = -2: 16 - 16 + 2 = 2 ≠ 0. x = 0: 0 + 0 + 2 = 2 ≠ 0. Maybe x = -1.5: (5.0625) + 2*(-3.375) + 2 = 5.0625 - 6.75 + 2 = 0.3125 ≠ 0. Hmm. Maybe there are no real roots? Let's check the derivative: 4x^3 + 6x^2. Setting to zero: x^2(4x + 6) = 0 => x = 0 or x = -6/4 = -1.5. So critical points at x = 0 and x = -1.5. Evaluate the original function at these points: at x = 0, f(0) = 2; at x = -1.5, f(-1.5) ≈ 0.3125 as above. Since the leading term is x^4, which tends to infinity as x approaches ±∞, and the function is positive at the critical points, the function might be always positive? Let's check x = 1: 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 > 0. So maybe all roots are complex? But the problem states they are four distinct roots, so maybe two real and two complex? Wait, but if all roots are complex, they must come in conjugate pairs. Wait, but x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0. Let me check if x = -1 is a root: as above, it's 1 - 2 + 2 = 1 ≠ 0. Maybe there are no real roots. Let me check x = -0.5: (0.0625) + 2*(-0.125) + 2 = 0.0625 - 0.25 + 2 = 1.8125 > 0. So maybe all roots are complex. Therefore, the roots are two pairs of complex conjugates.

Therefore, perhaps the roots can be paired as complex conjugates. For example, suppose the roots are \( \alpha, \overline{\alpha}, \beta, \overline{\beta} \). Then, pairing \( \alpha \) and \( \overline{\alpha} \) would give a product \( \alpha \overline{\alpha} = |\alpha|^2 \), which is real, and similarly for \( \beta \overline{\beta} \). But in that case, \( S_1 = |\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 \), and similarly for the others. Wait, but if we pair the roots as \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \), then their product would be \( \alpha \beta \), which is not necessarily real. Wait, but if the roots are paired as \( \alpha \) and \( \overline{\alpha} \), \( \beta \) and \( \overline{\beta} \), then the sums \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \) would each be the sum of a product of a root and its conjugate plus the product of the other pair's conjugate. Wait, maybe this approach is not helpful here.

Based on execution_3.1:
First, compute \( S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3 \). Let's compute each term:

Based on execution_3.2:
Alternatively, maybe we can use Vieta's formula for the products of roots three at a time. Wait, the sum of products three at a time is \( \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0 \). Let's denote this sum as \( S_4 = 0 \).

If we consider the product \( S_1 S_2 S_3 \), maybe we can express it in terms of the roots. Let's attempt to compute \( S_1 S_2 S_3 \).

<prompt_4.2> Calculate the product \( S_1 S_2 S_3 \) by expanding and simplifying the expressions. </prompt_4.2>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
\( S_1 S_2 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) \)
\( S_1 S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) \)
\( S_2 S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) \)

This seems quite involved. Maybe there's a smarter way. Let's consider that:

\( S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0 \)

We can also consider the sum \( S_1^2 + S_2^2 + S_3^2 \). Let's compute that:

\( S_1^2 + S_2^2 + S_3^2 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)^2 + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3)^2 \)

Expanding each square:

= \( (\alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2 + 2\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2) + (\alpha_1^2\alpha_3^2 + 2\alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_4^2) + (\alpha_1^2\alpha_4^2 + 2\alpha_1\alpha_4\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2) \)

Combine like terms:

= \( \alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2 + 2\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 + 2\alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_2\alpha_4 + 2\alpha_1\alpha_4\alpha_2\alpha_3 \)

Simplify the cross terms:

Each cross term is \( 2\alpha_i\alpha_j\alpha_k\alpha_l \), and since multiplication is commutative, all three cross terms are the same. So:

= \( \alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2 + 6\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 \)

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a better approach. Let's think about the elementary symmetric sums.

We know the elementary symmetric sums:

- \( e_1 = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2 \)
- \( e_2 = \sum_{1 \leq i < j \leq 4} \alpha_i\alpha_j = 0 \)
- \( e_3 = \sum_{1 \leq i < j < k \leq 4} \alpha_i\alpha_j\alpha_k = 0 \)
- \( e_4 = \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2 \)

We need to express \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \) in terms of these. Let's note that \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \) are the three possible ways to partition the four roots into two pairs and sum the products of each pair. 

Alternatively, perhaps consider that if we can compute the elementary symmetric sums of \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), we can form the desired cubic equation. Let's denote \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \) as roots of a cubic equation. Then, the cubic equation would be \( t^3 - (S_1 + S_2 + S_3)t^2 + (S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3)t - S_1 S_2 S_3 = 0 \). Since \( S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0 \), the equation simplifies to \( t^3 + (S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3)t - S_1 S_2 S_3 = 0 \).

Therefore, if we can compute \( S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3 \) and \( S_1 S_2 S_3 \), we can determine the cubic equation whose roots are \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), and hence find their values.
</execution_4.1>

<execution_4.2>
First, note that each \( S_i \) is a sum of two products. So, \( S_1 S_2 S_3 \) would be the product of three such sums. This seems quite complicated, but perhaps there's a pattern or simplification.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \) are the roots of the cubic equation \( t^3 - (S_1 + S_2 + S_3)t^2 + (S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3)t - S_1 S_2 S_3 = 0 \). Since \( S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0 \), the equation simplifies to \( t^3 + (S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3)t - S_1 S_2 S_3 = 0 \). If we can compute \( S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3 \) and \( S_1 S_2 S_3 \), then we can write down this cubic equation and solve for its roots. However, computing these might be tedious.

Similarly, \( S_1 S_3 \):

\( (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) \)

Now, summing \( S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3 \), we get a total of:

For \( S_1 S_2 \):
- \( \alpha_1^2\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2^2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3^2\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4^2 \)

Terms with \( \alpha_4^2 \):
- \( \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4^2 \)
= \( \alpha_4^2(\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2) \)

Wait, this seems too involved. Maybe there's a better way to approach this. Let's consider using the known symmetric sums.

We know that:

- \( e_1 = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2 \)
- \( e_2 = \sum_{i<j} \alpha_i\alpha_j = 0 \)
- \( e_3 = \sum_{i<j<k} \alpha_i\alpha_j\alpha_k = 0 \)
- \( e_4 = \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2 \)

Let’s denote \( S_1 = ab + cd \), \( S_2 = ac + bd \), \( S_3 = ad + bc \), where \( a, b, c, d \) are the roots. Then, the product \( S_1 S_2 S_3 \) would be:

\( (ab + cd)(ac + bd)(ad + bc) \)

Expanding this seems complicated, but maybe there's a pattern. Alternatively, perhaps consider expanding two factors first:

First, multiply \( (ab + cd)(ac + bd) \):

= \( ab \cdot ac + ab \cdot bd + cd \cdot ac + cd \cdot bd \)
= \( a^2 bc + ab^2 d + a c^2 d + b c d^2 \)

Then multiply this by \( (ad + bc) \):

= \( (a^2 bc + ab^2 d + a c^2 d + b c d^2)(ad + bc) \)

This will result in 16 terms. Let's compute each term:

1. \( a^2 bc \cdot ad = a^3 b c d \)
2. \( a^2 bc \cdot bc = a^2 b^2 c^2 \)
3. \( ab^2 d \cdot ad = a^2 b^2 d^2 \)
4. \( ab^2 d \cdot bc = a b^3 c d \)
5. \( a c^2 d \cdot ad = a^2 c^2 d^2 \)
6. \( a c^2 d \cdot bc = a b c^3 d \)
7. \( b c d^2 \cdot ad = a b c d^3 \)
8. \( b c d^2 \cdot bc = b^2 c^2 d^2 \)

So combining all terms:

= \( a^3 b c d + a^2 b^2 c^2 + a^2 b^2 d^2 + a b^3 c d + a^2 c^2 d^2 + a b c^3 d + a b c d^3 + b^2 c^2 d^2 \)

This seems very complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way to compute \( S_1 S_2 S_3 \). Alternatively, perhaps consider that \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \) are related to the roots of a cubic equation. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that if we can express \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \) in terms of the elementary symmetric sums. Let's see:

Note that \( S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0 \), as established before. Now, let's compute \( S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3 \). Let's try to express this in terms of the known symmetric sums.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that:

\( (S_1 + S_2 + S_3)^2 = S_1^2 + S_2^2 + S_3^2 + 2(S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3) = 0 \)

But since \( S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0 \), this gives:

\( 0 = S_1^2 + S_2^2 + S_3^2 + 2(S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3) \)

But we already computed \( S_1^2 + S_2^2 + S_3^2 \) earlier, which was:

\( \alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2 + 6\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 \)

Therefore:

\( 0 = (\alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2) + 6\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 + 2(S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3) = 0 \)

Hence:

\( S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3 = -\frac{1}{2}(\alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2) - 3\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 \)

But this still leaves us with the problem of computing \( \sum \alpha_i^2\alpha_j^2 \) and \( \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 \). However, we know \( \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = e_4 = 2 \), so the last term is -3*2 = -6. But we still need to compute the sum of squares of products.

Let's compute \( \sum_{i < j} (\alpha_i\alpha_j)^2 \). Note that:

\( (\sum_{i < j} \alpha_i\alpha_j)^2 = \sum_{i < j} \alpha_i^2\alpha_j^2 + 2\sum_{i < j < k} \alpha_i\alpha_j\alpha_k^2 \)

But since we know \( e_2 = \sum_{i < j} \alpha_i\alpha_j = 0 \), then:

\( 0^2 = \sum_{i < j} \alpha_i^2\alpha_j^2 + 2\sum_{i < j < k} \alpha_i\alpha_j\alpha_k^2 \)

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps use the square of \( e_2 \):

\( e_2^2 = (\sum_{i < j} \alpha_i\alpha_j)^2 = \sum_{i < j} \alpha_i^2\alpha_j^2 + 2\sum_{i < j < k} \alpha_i\alpha_j\alpha_k \)

But since \( e_2 = 0 \), this gives:

\( 0 = \sum_{i < j} \alpha_i^2\alpha_j^2 + 2\sum_{i < j < k} \alpha_i\alpha_j\alpha_k \)

But we also know that \( e_3 = \sum_{i < j < k} \alpha_i\alpha_j\alpha_k = 0 \). Therefore:

\( 0 = \sum_{i < j} \alpha_i^2\alpha_j^2 + 2*0 \)

Thus, \( \sum_{i < j} \alpha_i^2\alpha_j^2 = 0 \). Wait, is that correct?

Wait, if \( e_2 = 0 \), then \( e_2^2 = 0 \), which equals the sum of squares of the products plus twice the sum of products of three roots. But since \( e_3 = 0 \), the second term is zero. Therefore, \( \sum_{i < j} (\alpha_i\alpha_j)^2 = 0 \).

Therefore, going back:

\( S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3 = -\frac{1}{2}(0) - 6 = -6 \)

Wait, that's a key insight! So, the sum \( S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3 = -6 \).

Based on execution_5.1:
Now, moving on to \( S_1 S_2 S_3 \). Let's try to compute this. Given the complexity, perhaps there's a trick here. Let's recall that the product \( S_1 S_2 S_3 \) is the product of the three sums. Let's try to expand this product.

<prompt_6.1> Calculate the product \( S_1 S_2 S_3 \) using the given Vieta's formulas and the previously computed sums. </prompt_6.1>
</Plan_6>

<Execution_6>
<execution_6.1>
First, note that each \( S_i \) is a sum of two products. Therefore, the product \( S_1 S_2 S_3 \) would involve 3 levels of multiplication. However, given the time constraints, perhaps we can use a different approach. Let's consider that the product \( S_1 S_2 S_3 \) can be expressed in terms of the elementary symmetric sums.

Alternatively, note that from the equation we derived earlier, \( t^3 + (S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3)t - S_1 S_2 S_3 = 0 \), which simplifies to \( t^3 - 6t - S_1 S_2 S_3 = 0 \). If we can find the value of \( S_1 S_2 S_3 \), we can determine the cubic equation.

But how? Let's recall that the product \( S_1 S_2 S_3 \) is equal to the product of the three possible pair products. However, perhaps there's a relation here. Let's consider that the four roots can be paired in three different ways, and each product \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \) corresponds to a different pairing. The product \( S_1 S_2 S_3 \) might relate to the square of the product of all four roots. Let's see:

The product of all four roots is \( \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2 \). So, \( ( \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 )^2 = 4 \). However, how does this relate to \( S_1 S_2 S_3 \)?

Wait, if we pair the roots as \( (\alpha_1\alpha_2) \) and \( (\alpha_3\alpha_4) \), then \( S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 \), but the product \( (\alpha_1\alpha_2)(\alpha_3\alpha_4) = \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2 \). Similarly, if we pair them differently, the products would be different, but their product would still be 2. However, \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \) are sums of products, not products. Therefore, the product \( S_1 S_2 S_3 \) would not directly relate to the product of the roots. However, maybe there's a relation through symmetric functions.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \) are the roots of the cubic equation we discussed earlier, which is \( t^3 - 6t - k = 0 \), where \( k = S_1 S_2 S_3 \). The roots of this cubic would be \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \). However, without knowing \( k \), we can't determine the exact roots. But perhaps there's a way to compute \( k \) using the original equation.

Alternatively, perhaps use the fact that the original quartic equation can be expressed in terms of the cubic equations whose roots are \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \). Wait, but the original quartic is quartic, so maybe not directly.

Alternatively, perhaps use the relation between the roots and the coefficients. Let's recall that:

\( S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0 \)

\( S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3 = -6 \)

\( S_1 S_2 S_3 = k \)

So the cubic equation is \( t^3 - 6t - k = 0 \). If we can find \( k \), we can find the roots. However, how?

Alternatively, perhaps consider that the product \( S_1 S_2 S_3 \) can be related to the square of the product of the roots. Wait, let's think:

If we pair the roots as \( (\alpha_1\alpha_2) \) and \( (\alpha_3\alpha_4) \), then \( S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 \), and the product \( (\alpha_1\alpha_2)(\alpha_3\alpha_4) = \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2 \). Similarly, if we pair them as \( (\alpha_1\alpha_3) \) and \( (\alpha_2\alpha_4) \), then \( S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 \), and their product is also 2. Similarly for \( S_3 \). However, \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \) are sums, not products. Therefore, the product \( S_1 S_2 S_3 \) is not directly related to 2. However, perhaps there's a relation through symmetric functions.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \) are related to the roots of a cubic equation. Let me think. If we take the three possible pair products and consider them as roots of a cubic, then perhaps this cubic can be related to the original quartic.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that the original quartic can be written as \( (x^2 - S_1 x + P_1)(x^2 - S_2 x + P_2) \), where \( P_1 \) and \( P_2 \) are the products of the pairs. Wait, but this is similar to factoring the quartic into two quadratics. However, earlier attempts to factor the quartic into quadratics with integer coefficients didn't work, but maybe with different \( P_1 \) and \( P_2 \), this could be possible. Let's explore this.

<Plan_7>
Based on execution_6.1:
Let's suppose that the quartic can be factored as \( (x^2 - S_1 x + P_1)(x^2 - S_2 x + P_2) = 0 \). Expanding this, we get:
\( x^4 - (S_1 + S_2)x^3 + (S_1 S_2 + P_1 + P_2)x^2 - (S_1 P_2 + S_2 P_1)x + P_1 P_2 = 0 \)

Comparing coefficients with the original quartic \( x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0 \), we have:

<prompt_7.1> Expand the product of the two quadratics and compare the coefficients with the original quartic equation to find relationships between \( S_1, S_2, P_1, P_2 \). </prompt_7.1>

1. Coefficient of \( x^3 \): \( -(S_1 + S_2) = 2 \) ⇒ \( S_1 + S_2 = -2 \)
2. Coefficient of \( x^2 \): \( S_1 S_2 + P_1 + P_2 = 0 \)
3. Coefficient of \( x \): \( -(S_1 P_2 + S_2 P_1) = 0 \)
4. Constant term: \( P_1 P_2 = 2 \)

<Plan_8>
Based on execution_7.1:
But from Vieta's formulas, we know that \( S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0 \), so \( S_3 = - (S_1 + S_2) \). If we assume that the quartic can be factored into two quadratics with roots \( \alpha, \beta \) and \( \gamma, \delta \), then \( S_1 \) and \( S_2 \) could be related to the sums of products of these roots. However, since we don't have the actual roots, this approach might not be helpful. Alternatively, perhaps consider that \( P_1 \) and \( P_2 \) are related to the roots as well. But without knowing the roots, this seems challenging.
