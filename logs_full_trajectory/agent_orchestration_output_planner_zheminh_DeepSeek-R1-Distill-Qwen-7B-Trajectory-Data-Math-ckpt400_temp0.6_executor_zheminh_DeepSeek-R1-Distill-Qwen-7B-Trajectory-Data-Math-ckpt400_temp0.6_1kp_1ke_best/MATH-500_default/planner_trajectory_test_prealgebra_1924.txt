Okay, let's see. I need to simplify the expression (-k + 4) + (-2 + 3k). Hmm, simplifying algebraic expressions. Alright, so first, I remember that when you have parentheses like this, you can remove them because the plus sign in front means the signs inside stay the same. So maybe I can just rewrite it without the parentheses.
Let me try that.

So, (-k + 4) + (-2 + 3k) becomes -k + 4 - 2 + 3k. Wait, is that right? Let me check.
The first parenthesis is -k + 4, and then the second is -2 + 3k. Yeah, adding those together.

Now, I need to combine like terms. Like terms are terms with the same variable raised to the same power.
So here, the terms with 'k' are -k and 3k. The constant terms are 4 and -2.

Let me group them.

First, the k terms: -k + 3k. Hmm, combining those. -k is the same as -1k, right? So -1k + 3k. That should be ( -1 + 3 )k, which is 2k. Okay, that part seems straightforward.

Now the constants: 4 and -2. Adding those together is 4 - 2, which equals 2.

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
So putting those together, the simplified expression should be 2k + 2.
Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the signs. Let's go through it again step by step.

<prompt_2.1> Verify the simplification process by going through the steps again. </prompt_2.1>

Is there any other step I might have messed up? Maybe combining the terms in the wrong order?
Like, if I had done constants first and then the k terms. Let me try that way. 4 - 2 is 2, and then -k + 3k is 2k.
Same result. So 2k + 2. 

Alternatively, could I have miscounted the coefficients? Let's see.

<prompt_2.2> Check for any possible mistakes in the coefficient counting during simplification. </prompt_2.2>

Is there a chance I missed a term? Let's count the terms again.
Original expression: (-k +4) + (-2 +3k). So first group has two terms: -k and +4. Second group has two terms: -2 and +3k. So total four terms: -k, +4, -2, +3k. Combined correctly. 

Another way to check is to substitute a value for k and see if both original and simplified expressions give the same result. Let's pick k = 1.

<prompt_2.3> Verify the simplified expression by substituting different values for k. </prompt_2.3>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Original expression: (-k + 4) + (-2 + 3k). Remove parentheses: -k + 4 - 2 + 3k. Combine the k terms: (-k + 3k) = 2k. Combine constants: (4 - 2) = 2. So yes, 2k + 2.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
The coefficients for k are -1 and +3. Adding them: -1 +3 = 2. Correct. If it were -k and -3k, that would be different, but here it's -k and +3k. So yes, 2k. 

Constants: 4 and -2. 4 -2 = 2. Correct. So 2k + 2.
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
Original: (-1 +4) + (-2 +3*1) = (3) + (-2 +3) = 3 +1 =4. Simplified: 2*1 +2 =4. Okay, same.

Another value, k=0. Original: (0 +4) + (-2 +0) =4 + (-2)=2. Simplified:0 +2=2. Correct.

k= -1. Original: (1 +4) + (-2 + (-3)) =5 + (-5)=0. Simplified: 2*(-1) +2= -2 +2=0.
</execution_2.3>
</Execution_2>

<Final_answer>
Therefore, the simplified expression is $\boxed{2k+2}$.
