<Question>
Two numbers, $x$ and $y$ are selected at random from the interval $(0,3)$.  What is the probability that a triangle with sides of length 1, $x$, and $y$ exists?
</Question>

<think>
<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to find the probability that three numbers—1, x, and y—can form a triangle when x and y are chosen randomly from the interval (0, 3). Hmm, let me remember the triangle inequality theorem. I think it says that the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side. So, for three lengths to form a triangle, each pair of sides must add up to something bigger than the remaining side.

<prompt_1.1> Recall the triangle inequality theorem and set up the conditions for 1, x, and y to form a triangle. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
Let me write that down. The three conditions would be:

1. 1 + x > y
2. 1 + y > x
3. x + y > 1

Since x and y are both selected from (0, 3), all three variables are positive. So, the first two conditions deal with the sum of the two smaller sides being greater than the largest side. The third condition ensures that the sum of the two sides with length 1 and the other side is greater than the remaining side. Wait, actually, no. The third condition is x + y > 1. That makes sense because if both x and y are, say, very small, their sum might not be greater than 1, which would fail the triangle inequality.

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Since x and y are chosen from (0, 3), all three variables are positive. So, the first two conditions deal with the sum of the two smaller sides being greater than the largest side. The third condition ensures that the sum of the two sides with length 1 and the other side is greater than the remaining side.
Wait, actually, no. The third condition is x + y > 1. That makes sense because if both x and y are, say, very small, their sum might not be greater than 1, which would fail the triangle inequality.

Now, since x and y are selected from the interval (0, 3), we can represent all possible (x, y) pairs as points in a coordinate plane where both x and y range from 0 to 3. This forms a square with side length 3, so the total area is 9. The probability we're looking for is the area of the region where all three conditions are satisfied divided by 9.

So, let me visualize this square where x is on the horizontal axis and y is on the vertical axis, both from 0 to 3. The total area is 9. Now, we need to find the area of the region where:

<prompt_2.1> Visualize the square and determine the region where the triangle conditions are satisfied. </prompt_2.1>
-----

Alternatively, another way to compute the area is to consider the complement: the area where the three triangle inequalities are not satisfied, and subtract that from the total area.
But maybe the original method is straightforward.

Wait, but let me check with an example. Suppose x and y are both 0.5.

<prompt_2.2> Check the conditions with specific examples to verify the probability. </prompt_2.2>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
1. 1 + x > y
2. 1 + y > x
3. x + y > 1

Let me analyze each of these inequalities.

Starting with the first one: 1 + x > y. This can be rewritten as y < x + 1. So, in the coordinate plane, this is the area below the line y = x + 1.

The second inequality: 1 + y > x, which simplifies to x < y + 1. This is the area below the line x = y + 1.

The third inequality: x + y > 1. This is the area above the line x + y = 1.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Then 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 > 0.5, which is true. Similarly, 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 > 0.5, true. And 0.5 + 0.5 = 1, which is not greater than 1. So, that point (0.5, 0.5) is on the boundary where x + y = 1, so it's excluded. So, points where x + y >=1 are included. Wait, but the third inequality is x + y >1, so the region where x + y >1 is above the line x + y =1. Similarly, the regions where 1 + x > y and 1 + y > x are the regions above y =1 -x and y =x -1, respectively.

Wait, let me think again. Let's plot each inequality.

First inequality: 1 + x > y. This can be rewritten as y < x +1. So, the region below the line y = x +1.

Second inequality: 1 + y > x, which is x < y +1. So, the region to the left of the line x = y +1.

Third inequality: x + y >1. This is the region above the line x + y =1.

So, the feasible region is the intersection of these three regions: below y =x +1, left of x = y +1, and above x + y =1.

But since x and y are both between 0 and 3, let's see how these lines intersect the square.

First, the line y =x +1. When x is 0, y is 1. When x is 3, y is 4, which is outside the square. So, this line starts at (0,1) and goes up to (2,3), because when x=2, y=3. Beyond x=2, y would exceed 3, which is the maximum.

Similarly, the line x = y +1. This can be rewritten as y =x -1. When y=0, x=1. When y=3, x=4, which is outside the square. So, this line starts at (1,0) and goes up to (3,2).
</execution_2.2>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Let me sketch this mentally. The line y = x + 1 starts at (0,1) and goes up with a slope of 1.

<prompt_3.1> Analyze the intersection of the regions defined by the inequalities. </prompt_3.1>
-----

Based on execution_2.2:
The line x + y =1 starts at (1,0) and (0,1), so it's the same line as part of the boundary for the third inequality.

<prompt_3.2> Re-evaluate the conditions and confirm the probability by considering specific points. </prompt_3.2>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
At x=3, y=4, which is outside the square. Similarly, the line x = y +1 is the same as y =x -1. It starts at (1,0) and goes up with a slope of 1, ending at (3,2) when x=3, y=2.

The third inequality x + y >1 is the line x + y =1, which connects (1,0) to (0,1). The region above this line is where x + y >1.

So, putting all these together, the feasible region for (x, y) is bounded by:

- Above x + y =1,
- Below y =x +1,
- To the left of x = y +1.

But since x and y are between 0 and 3, these lines intersect each other and the square boundaries. Let me find the intersection points of these lines to determine the vertices of the feasible region.

First, find where y =x +1 intersects x = y +1. Substitute y from the first equation into the second: x = (x +1) +1 => x = x +2 => 0=2. That's impossible, so these two lines are parallel? Wait, no. Wait, y =x +1 has a slope of 1, and x = y +1 can be rewritten as y =x -1, which also has a slope of 1. So, they are parallel lines, separated by a distance. Therefore, they don't intersect. That makes sense.

Next, find where y =x +1 intersects x + y =1. Substitute y =x +1 into x + y =1:



But let me confirm this with another approach. Let me compute the area step by step.



Alternatively, maybe I can compute the area where the triangle is not possible and subtract from the total.

The complement would be the cases where at least one of the triangle inequalities is violated. So, the complement is the union of three regions:



But just to make sure, let me consider another perspective. Since x and y are both between 0 and 3, and we need all three sides 1, x, y to form a triangle.



Alternatively, if I imagine fixing x, then for each x, find the range of y that satisfies the inequalities.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
So, the intersection of all these regions is a polygon bounded by several lines. Let me try to find the vertices of this polygon to compute the area.

First, let's find where the three lines intersect each other.

1. Intersection of y =x +1 and x = y +1:

Substitute y =x +1 into x = y +1:

x = (x +1) +1 => x =x +2 => 0=2. That's impossible, so these two lines are parallel? Wait, y =x +1 has a slope of 1, and x = y +1 can be rewritten as y =x -1, which also has a slope of 1. So, they are parallel lines, separated by a distance. Therefore, they never intersect.

2. Intersection of y =x +1 and x + y =1:

Substitute y =x +1 into x + y =1:

x + (x +1) =1 => 2x +1 =1 => 2x=0 => x=0. Then y=0 +1=1. So, the intersection point is (0,1).

3. Intersection of x = y +1 and x + y =1:

Substitute x = y +1 into x + y =1:

(y +1) + y =1 => 2y +1 =1 => 2y=0 => y=0. Then x=0 +1=1. So, the intersection point is (1,0).

Now, the line x + y =1 intersects the square (0,3) at (1,0) and (0,1). The line y =x +1 intersects the square at (0,1) and (2,3). The line x = y +1 intersects the square at (1,0) and (3,2).

So, the feasible region is bounded by:

- Above x + y =1, so above the line from (1,0) to (0,1).
- Below y =x +1, which goes from (0,1) to (2,3).
- Left of x = y +1, which goes from (1,0) to (3,2).

Hmm, let me try to visualize this. The feasible region is a polygon with vertices at (0,1), (1,0), (3,2), and (2,3). Wait, is that correct?

Wait, let me check.
</execution_3.2>
</Execution_3>

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
First, the intersection of y =x +1 and x + y =1. Let's solve these equations:

<prompt_4.1> Calculate the area of the feasible region by integrating over the square. </prompt_4.1>
-----

Based on execution_3.2:
If x is between 0 and 1, then y must be greater than 1 -x. But since x is less than 1, 1 -x is greater than 0. However, y also has to be less than x +1.

<prompt_4.2> Reconfirm the probability by visualizing the feasible region and calculating the area. </prompt_4.2>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
y = x +1

x + y =1

Substitute the first into the second:

x + (x +1) =1

2x +1 =1

2x =0

x=0, then y=1. So, they intersect at (0,1).

Next, the intersection of x + y =1 with the square. When x=0, y=1; when y=0, x=1. So, the line x + y =1 cuts the square from (0,1) to (1,0).

Now, the region where y < x +1 and x < y +1 and x + y >1. Let me see.

For y < x +1: Below the line from (0,1) to (2,3).

For x < y +1: Left of the line from (1,0) to (3,2).

And above x + y =1.

So, the feasible region is a polygon bounded by these lines. To find the area, maybe we can split it into parts.

First, let's consider the area above x + y =1. The total area above x + y =1 in the square is a triangle with vertices at (1,0), (0,1), and (3,3). Wait, no. Wait, the line x + y =1 cuts the square into two regions: below (where x + y <1) and above (where x + y >1). The area above is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0,1), (0,3), (3,3), (3,0), but wait, no. Wait, when x + y >1, the region is above the line from (1,0) to (0,1), so the area above is a pentagon? Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, the line x + y =1 intersects the square at (1,0) and (0,1). So, the area above this line within the square is the set of points where x + y >1. This area is a pentagon? Wait, no. If you imagine the square from (0,0) to (3,3), the line x + y =1 goes from (0,1) to (1,0). So, above that line, the region is everything in the square that's above the line. That would be a quadrilateral with vertices at (0,1), (0,3), (3,3), (3,0), but (3,0) is below the line x + y =1. Wait, no. Wait, when x is 3, y would have to be greater than 1 -3 = -2, which is always true since y is positive. So, actually, the area above x + y =1 in the square is a pentagon? Hmm, maybe not. Let me actually draw it mentally.

Alternatively, the area where x + y >1 in the square [0,3]x[0,3] is the entire square except for the triangle with vertices (0,0), (0,1), (1,0). The area of that triangle is 0.5*1*1=0.5. So, the area above x + y =1 is 9 - 0.5 =8.5. But wait, that can't be right because when x and y are both 3, x + y =6 >1, so the entire upper part is included. Wait, actually, the area where x + y >1 is the square minus the triangle where x + y <=1. The triangle where x + y <=1 has vertices at (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), so area 0.5. Therefore, the area where x + y >1 is 9 -0.5=8.5.
</execution_4.1>

<execution_4.2>
Wait, for x between 0 and 1, y has to satisfy both y >1 -x and y <x +1. Let's see what happens here. For example, when x=0, y must be greater than 1 and less than 1. That's impossible. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, when x=0, the inequalities become:

1 + 0 > y => y <1

1 + y >0 => always true since y>0

x + y >1 => 0 + y >1 => y>1

So, for x=0, y must be both less than 1 and greater than 1, which is impossible. Therefore, when x is between 0 and 1, there are no possible y's that satisfy all three inequalities. That makes sense. So, the feasible region starts at x=1.

Wait, but when x=1, the third inequality x + y >1 becomes y >0, which is always true since y is in (0,3). So, for x >=1, the third inequality is automatically satisfied because y is positive. Wait, no. If x is 0.5, then x + y >1 would require y >0.5. But in that case, when x=0.5, y has to be greater than 0.5 (from x + y >1) and also less than x +1=1.5 (from 1 +x > y). So, for x=0.5, y must be between 0.5 and 1.5.
</execution_4.2>
</Execution_4>

<Plan_5>
Based on execution_4.1:
But that seems too large. Wait, the total area of the square is 9. The area where x + y <=1 is a right triangle with legs of length 1, so area 0.5. Therefore, the area where x + y >1 is 9 -0.5=8.5.
-----

Based on execution_4.2:
But when x is greater than or equal to 1, x + y >1 is automatically satisfied because x is already at least 1, and y is at least 0. So, for x >=1, y only needs to satisfy 1 + x > y and 1 + y > x. Let's analyze that.

<prompt_5.1> Analyze the conditions for x >=1 and x <1 to find the feasible region. </prompt_5.1>
</Plan_5>

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
For x >=1, 1 + x > y implies y <x +1, which is always true since x +1 is at least 2, and y is at most 3. However, the other inequality, 1 + y >x, implies y >x -1. Since x >=1, x -1 >=0. So, for x >=1, y must be greater than x -1 and less than x +1. But since y is in (0,3), we have to adjust the bounds accordingly.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe splitting the integral into regions where x is between 0 and1, and x between1 and3.

But earlier, we saw that for x between0 and1, there are no y that satisfy all three inequalities. So, the feasible region is only for x between1 and3. For x in [1,3], y must satisfy:

1. y > max(1 -x, x -1)

But since x >=1, 1 -x <=0, so max(1 -x, x -1)=x -1.

And y <x +1.

But also, since y must be in (0,3), we have to consider the overlap.

So, for x in [1,3], y must satisfy:

x -1 < y <x +1

But also, y must be in (0,3). So, the lower bound is max(x -1, 0) and the upper bound is min(x +1,3).

Therefore, the length of the interval for y is min(x +1,3) - max(x -1,0).

Let's compute this:

For x in [1,2):

x -1 is in [0,1), so lower bound is x -1.

Upper bound is x +1, which is in [2,3). Since x is less than 2, x +1 is less than 3. So, upper bound is x +1.

Thus, the length is (x +1) - (x -1) =2.

For x in [2,3]:

x -1 is in [1,2], so lower bound is x -1.

Upper bound is min(x +1,3). Since x +1 when x=2 is 3, and for x>2, x +1>3. So, for x in [2,3], upper bound is 3.

Thus, the length is 3 - (x -1)=4 -x.

Therefore, the area can be computed by integrating the length of y intervals over x from1 to3.

So, from x=1 to x=2, the length is 2, and from x=2 to x=3, the length is 4 -x.

Therefore, the area is:

Integral from1 to2 of 2 dx + Integral from2 to3 of (4 -x) dx

Compute the first integral: 2*(2-1)=2*1=2.

Compute the second integral:

Integral of 4 -x dx from2 to3 is [4x -0.5x^2] from2 to3.

At x=3: 4*3 -0.5*(9)=12 -4.5=7.5

At x=2: 4*2 -0.5*(4)=8 -2=6

Subtract:7.5 -6=1.5

So total area is2 +1.5=3.5.

Therefore, the area where all three inequalities are satisfied is3.5. Hence, the probability is3.5/9=7/18≈0.3889.

Wait, but earlier I thought the area was7/18, which is approximately0.3889. But let me confirm this again.

Wait, total area is9, and the feasible area is3.5. So,3.5/9=7/18. Yes. So, the probability is7/18.
</execution_5.1>
</Execution_5>

<Plan_6>
Based on execution_5.1:
But let me check this again because I might have made a mistake in splitting the integral.

Wait, from x=1 to x=2, the length of y is2, so integrating2 dx from1 to2 gives2*(1)=2.

<prompt_6.1> Verify the integration process to confirm the area calculation. </prompt_6.1>

But let me confirm the feasible region again. When x is between1 and2, y is betweenx -1 andx +1.

<prompt_6.2> Reconfirm the probability by analyzing the feasible region for x between 1 and 3. </prompt_6.2>
-----

Based on execution_5.1, execution_6.1, execution_6.2:
So, the answer should be7/18.

But let me check with another approach.

<prompt_6.3> Confirm the probability using an alternative approach by considering the conditions for triangle inequality. </prompt_6.3>
</Plan_6>

<Execution_6>
<execution_6.1>
Then from x=2 to3, the length is4 -x, so integrating from2 to3:

Integral of4 -x dx is4x -0.5x². Evaluate at3:4*3 -0.5*9=12 -4.5=7.5. Evaluate at2:4*2 -0.5*4=8 -2=6. Subtract:7.5 -6=1.5. So total area is2 +1.5=3.5. So, 3.5/9=7/18.
</execution_6.1>

<execution_6.2>
Since x is between1 and2, x -1 is between0 and1, andx +1 is between2 and3. So, y ranges fromx -1 tox +1, which is a length of2. So, that part is correct.

For x between2 and3, y must be greater thanx -1 (which is between1 and2) and less than3. So, the length is3 - (x -1)=4 -x. So, integrating from2 to3:

Integral of4 -x dx from2 to3:

Antiderivative is4x -0.5x².

At upper limit3:4*3 -0.5*9=12 -4.5=7.5

At lower limit2:4*2 -0.5*4=8 -2=6

Subtract:7.5 -6=1.5

So, total area is2 +1.5=3.5. So, 3.5/9=7/18≈0.3889.
</execution_6.2>

<execution_6.3>
Suppose we fix x. For each x, the range of y that satisfies all three inequalities is:

y > max(1 -x, x -1) and y < min(x +1, 3).

But since x is in (0,3):

- When x <1, 1 -x >0 and x -1 <0, so max(1 -x, x -1)=1 -x. But x <1, so 1 -x >0. However, the lower bound for y is1 -x, but y must also be greater than x -1 (which is negative), so the effective lower bound is1 -x. But since x is in (0,1), 1 -x is in (0,1). However, the upper bound isx +1, which is less than2. So, y must be in (1 -x, x +1). But also, y must be positive, which it is since1 -x is positive here.

But when x >=1, max(1 -x, x -1)=x -1 (since x -1 >=0 when x >=1). So, for x in [1,3], y must be in (x -1, x +1), but also y must be in (0,3). Therefore, the lower bound is max(x -1,0) and upper bound is min(x +1,3). So, as before.

Therefore, for x in [0,1):

y must be in (1 -x, x +1). But since x is in [0,1), 1 -x is in (0,1], and x +1 is in (1,2). So, y must be in (1 -x, x +1). The length of this interval is (x +1) - (1 -x)=2x.

For example, when x=0, the length is0, which makes sense because y would have to be in (1,1), which is impossible. When x approaches1 from below, the length approaches2*1=2.

For x in [1,2):

y must be in (x -1, x +1). The length is2.

For x in [2,3]:

y must be in (x -1,3). The length is3 - (x -1)=4 -x.

Therefore, the total area is:

Integral from0 to1 of2x dx + Integral from1 to2 of2 dx + Integral from2 to3 of(4 -x) dx

Compute each integral:

First integral: ∫0^1 2x dx = [x^2]0^1 =1 -0=1

Second integral: ∫1^2 2 dx=2*(2 -1)=2

Third integral: ∫2^3 (4 -x)dx= [4x -0.5x^2]2^3= (12 -4.5) - (8 -2)=7.5 -6=1.5

Total area=1 +2 +1.5=4.5

Wait, wait, this contradicts the previous result. Earlier, I thought the area was3.5, but according to this, it's4.5. Which is correct?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the previous calculation. Let me check again.

</Plan_7>

<Execution_7>
<execution_7.1>
The length of y is (x +1) - (1 -x)=2x. So, integrating2x from0 to1:

∫0^1 2x dx = [x²]0^1=1. So that's correct.

Then, for x in [1,2), the length is2, so ∫1^2 2 dx=2*(1)=2. Correct.

For x in [2,3], the length is4 -x, so ∫2^3 (4 -x)dx= [4x -0.5x²] from2 to3.

At3:4*3 -0.5*9=12 -4.5=7.5

At2:4*2 -0.5*4=8 -2=6

Difference:7.5 -6=1.5. So, total area=1 +2 +1.5=4.5. So, total area is4.5.

But wait, this contradicts the previous result of3.5. So, which is correct? Let me check again.

Wait, in the initial approach, I considered that for x in [0,1), there are no y's that satisfy all conditions, so the area is0. But according to this second approach, for x in [0,1), the area is ∫0^1 2x dx=1. But why the discrepancy?

Ah! Because in the first approach, I considered the area above x + y =1 as8.5, but actually, the total area where x + y >1 is8.5, but then we have to consider the other inequalities. However, in reality, the three conditions are not independent. So, the feasible region is the intersection of all three inequalities. Therefore, the initial approach of taking the area above x + y =1 and subtracting the areas where 1 +x <= y or1 +y <=x is more accurate, but perhaps I made a mistake there.

Alternatively, this second approach, where we split the integral into three regions based on x, seems more accurate because it directly accounts for the varying bounds of y based on x. Therefore, according to this, the area is4.5. Then, the probability would be4.5/9=1/2. But that can't be right because if we consider the triangle inequalities, it's not 50%.

<Plan_8>
Based on execution_7.1:
Wait, but according to the second approach, the area is4.5. But according to the first approach, it was3.5. So, which is correct?

Let me check with x=0.5.

<prompt_8.1> Verify the integration process and correct the area calculation for the feasible region. </prompt_8.1>
-----

Based on execution_7.1, execution_8.1:
Wait, this is conflicting with the previous result. Let me check with another example. Let x=2.5.

<prompt_8.2> Re-evaluate the integration process and confirm the correct area calculation. </prompt_8.2>
</Plan_8>

<Execution_8>
<execution_8.1>
If x=0.5, then y must be in (1 -0.5,0.5 +1)=(0.5,1.5). So, length is1. The integral for x in [0,1) gives2x integrated from0 to1, which is1. That seems correct. For x=1.5, y must be in (0.5,2.5), length=2. For x=2.5, y must be in (1.5,3), length=1.5. So, integrating those gives the correct areas. So, the total area is indeed4.5. Therefore, the probability is4.5/9=0.5.

But that contradicts the initial result of7/18. So, which is correct?

Wait, I must have made a mistake in the first approach. Let me re-examine the first approach.

In the first approach, I considered the area above x + y =1 as8.5. Then, subtract the areas where 1 +x <= y or1 +y <=x. But perhaps that approach is not correct because the regions where 1 +x <= y and1 +y <=x overlap in some way.

Alternatively, maybe the second approach is correct because it directly integrates over x and y, considering the feasible regions. Since the second approach gives4.5, which is half of the square, but intuitively, the probability shouldn't be 50%.
</execution_8.1>

<execution_8.2>
Then y must satisfy:

1. 1 +x > y => y <3.5

2. 1 + y >x => y >1.5

3. x + y >1 => y > -1.5 (always true)

But since y is in (0,3), the effective bounds are y in (1.5,3). So, the length is1.5. Which is4 -x=4 -2.5=1.5. Correct.

Similarly, for x=1.5:

y must satisfy:

1. y <2.5

2. y >0.5

3. y > -0.5

So, y in (0.5,2.5), length=2. Which is4 -1.5=2.5? Wait, no. Wait, when x=1.5,4 -x=2.5. But the actual length is2.5 -0.5=2. Hmm, no. Wait, x=1.5 is in [1,2). So, y must be in (x -1, x +1)=(0.5,2.5). The length is2.5 -0.5=2. Which is correct. So, the integral is correct.

Therefore, the area is4.5. So, the probability is4.5/9=0.5.

Based on execution_8.2:
But that seems high. Let me think again. If x and y are both between0 and3, what's the chance that1, x, y can form a triangle?

Well, for example, if x and y are both greater than or equal to1.5, then1 +x and1 +y would be greater than2.5, but x and y could be up to3. So, maybe it's possible.

But according to the calculations, the area is4.5. Let me check with x=0.25.

</Execution_9>

<Plan_10>
Based on execution_9.1:
If x=0.25, then y must be in (1 -0.25,0.25 +1)=(0.75,1.25). So, length=0.5. The integral for x in [0,1) gives2x integrated from0 to1, which is1. So, for x=0.25, the contribution is0.5, which is correct. Similarly, for x=0.5, the length is1, which integrates to1. So, the integral seems correct.

Therefore, the probability is4.5/9=0.5. So, the answer should be1/2.

But this contradicts my initial thought of7/18. So, where is the mistake?

Wait, in the first approach, I considered the area where all three inequalities are satisfied as the intersection of the three regions. However, maybe the correct way is to use geometric probability. The total area is9. The feasible area is4.5. Therefore, the probability is0.5.

But let's check with another method. Let's consider the three inequalities:

1. y <x +1

2. y >x -1

3. y >1 -x

So, combining these, y must be in the intersection of these three regions. Graphically, this is the area bounded by y >max(1 -x, x -1) and y <x +1. So, the area can be calculated as the integral over x from0 to3 of [min(x +1,3) - max(1 -x, x -1,0)] dx.

But breaking this into intervals:

For x from0 to1:

max(1 -x, x -1)=1 -x (since x -1 is negative)

min(x +1,3)=x +1

So, the integrand is(x +1) - (1 -x)=2x. So, integral from0 to1 of2x dx=1.

For x from1 to2:

max(1 -x, x -1)=x -1 (since x -1 >=0)

min(x +1,3)=x +1 (since x +1 <=3 when x <=2)

So, integrand is(x +1) - (x -1)=2. Integral from1 to2 of2 dx=2.

For x from2 to3:

max(1 -x, x -1)=x -1 (since x -1 >=1)

min(x +1,3)=3 (since x +1 >=3 when x >=2)

So, integrand is3 - (x -1)=4 -x. Integral from2 to3 of(4 -x)dx=1.5.

Total integral=1 +2 +1.5=4.5. So, this confirms the area is4.5. Hence, probability is4.5/9=0.5.

Therefore, the correct answer is1/2.

But why did the first approach give7/18? Because in the first approach, I incorrectly calculated the area where all three inequalities are satisfied as the area above x + y =1 minus the areas where 1 +x <= y or1 +y <=x. However, this approach is flawed because the regions where 1 +x <= y and1 +y <=x are not disjoint in a way that allows simple subtraction. Instead, the correct approach is to directly compute the area by considering the feasible region as the intersection of the three inequalities, which leads to the integral result of4.5. Therefore, the correct probability is1/2.
