Evaluate $(1+2i)6-3i$.
</Question>

<Plan_1>
Okay, let's see. I need to evaluate (1 + 2i)6 - 3i. Hmm, first, I should figure out what operation is happening here. The expression is written as (1 + 2i)6 - 3i. Wait, is that (1 + 2i) multiplied by 6, and then subtract 3i? Or is it (1 + 2i) raised to the 6th power, then subtract 3i? The way it's written, with the 6 right after the parenthesis, might mean multiplication. But sometimes, especially in algebra, when a number or variable is next to a parenthesis, it could denote exponentiation. Hmm. Let me check the original problem again.
The user wrote: Evaluate (1+2i)6-3i. So, written like that, in plain text, it's ambiguous. But usually, in math notation, if it's (1 + 2i) followed by a number and then another term, it's likely multiplication. So probably (1 + 2i) multiplied by 6, then subtract 3i. But I should confirm.

Alternatively, if it's (1 + 2i) raised to the 6th power, then subtract 3i, that would be written with parentheses around the exponent, like (1 + 2i)^6 - 3i. Since it's written as (1+2i)6, that might mean (1 + 2i) times 6.

Let me proceed under that assumption first.

So, first step: compute (1 + 2i) multiplied by 6. Then subtract 3i from the result.

Let's do that step by step.

<prompt_1.1> Perform the multiplication and subtraction as per the above plan. </prompt_1.1>

But maybe the problem was intended to be (1 + 2i) raised to the 6th power, then subtract 3i? Let me check the original problem again.

Multiplying (1 + 2i) by 6: scalar multiplication with a complex number. That should be straightforward. Multiply each component (real and imaginary) by 6.

So, 6*(1) + 6*(2i) = 6 + 12i. Then subtract 3i from that result. So, 6 + 12i - 3i = 6 + 9i.

Based on execution_1.1:
But maybe the problem was intended to be (1 + 2i) raised to the 6th power, then subtract 3i? Let's check.

<prompt_2.1> Explore the possibility of exponentiation and perform the calculation if that interpretation is correct. </prompt_2.1>

If it's (1 + 2i)^6 - 3i, that would be a more complex calculation involving complex numbers raised to a power. Let me see. The user might have made a typo or formatting error. But without more context, it's hard to say. However, given standard notation conventions, the lack of an exponentiation symbol (like ^) suggests it's multiplication. So, unless specified otherwise, (1 + 2i)6 is likely (1 + 2i)*6.

But just to be thorough, maybe I should consider both interpretations. Let me first solve it under the initial assumption, then check if exponentiation is possible.

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
First interpretation: (1 + 2i) * 6 - 3i

As I calculated before, that gives 6 + 9i.

Second interpretation: (1 + 2i)^6 - 3i

Let's explore this. If that's the case, then we need to compute (1 + 2i) raised to the 6th power and then subtract 3i. But since the original problem didn't have parentheses around the 6, but in the problem statement it's written as (1+2i)6, which in standard math notation would not have parentheses around the 6. So unless it's a typo, perhaps the first interpretation is correct.

But maybe the user intended exponentiation. Let me check again.

<prompt_3.1> Re-evaluate the problem based on the initial assumption and confirm the correct interpretation. </prompt_3.1>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
The problem is written as: Evaluate (1+2i)6-3i. So, written as (1+2i)6-3i. If it were multiplication, it would be (1+2i)*6 -3i, but written without the multiplication sign. However, in some contexts, especially in programming or certain mathematical notations, writing (1+2i)6 might mean (1+2i)^6. But in standard mathematical notation, that's not common. Usually, exponentiation is denoted with a caret (^) or parentheses with the exponent. Therefore, without an exponentiation symbol, it's more likely multiplication.

Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is (1 + 2i) multiplied by 6, then subtract 3i. So the answer is 6 + 9i.

Based on execution_3.1:
Wait, let me confirm once again. If it's (1 + 2i)6, that could be interpreted as (1 + 2i) multiplied by 6. Then subtract 3i. So the steps would be:

<prompt_4.1> Perform the calculation and subtraction as per the initial interpretation. </prompt_4.1>

But let me check if there's a possibility that the 6 is an exponent. For example, in some contexts, like in physics or engineering, sometimes numbers following parentheses without an operator can denote something else, but in standard mathematics, (1 + 2i)6 would likely mean (1 + 2i) multiplied by 6. The exponentiation would usually be written as (1 + 2i)^6 or (1 + 2i)^(6).

<prompt_4.2> Confirm the correct interpretation and finalize the solution. </prompt_4.2>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
1. (1 + 2i) * 6 = 6*(1) + 6*(2i) = 6 + 12i

2. Subtract 3i: 6 + 12i - 3i = 6 + (12i - 3i) = 6 + 9i

Therefore, the result is 6 + 9i.
</execution_4.1>

<execution_4.2>
Therefore, I can be confident that the problem is asking for (1 + 2i) multiplied by 6, then subtract 3i. So the steps are:

Multiply (1 + 2i) by 6: 6*(1) + 6*(2i) = 6 + 12i

Subtract 3i: 6 + 12i - 3i = 6 + 9i

Therefore, the result is 6 + 9i. In boxed form, that would be \boxed{6 + 9i}.

But just to be absolutely thorough, let me consider if there's any other interpretation. For example, if the problem was written in a programming context, like in Python, sometimes juxtaposition can mean something else, but in standard math notation, (1 + 2i)6 would not be standard. So unless specified otherwise, multiplication is the only reasonable interpretation here.

So, conclusion: the answer is 6 + 9i.
