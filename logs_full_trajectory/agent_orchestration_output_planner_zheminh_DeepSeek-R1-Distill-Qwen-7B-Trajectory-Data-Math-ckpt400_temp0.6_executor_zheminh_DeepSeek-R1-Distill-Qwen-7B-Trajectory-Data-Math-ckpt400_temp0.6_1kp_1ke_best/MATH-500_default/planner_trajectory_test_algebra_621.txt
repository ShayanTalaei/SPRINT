Okay, so I need to convert the quadratic equation x² + 2.6x + 3.6 into the form (x + b)² + c. Then find the sum of b and c as a decimal. Hmm, let's see. I remember this is called completing the square. Let me try to recall how that works.

First, the standard form of a quadratic is ax² + bx + c, and to complete the square, we want to write it in the form a(x - h)² + k.

<prompt_1.1> Recall and outline the steps for completing the square as per the above plan. </prompt_1.1>

But in this case, the leading coefficient is 1, so a = 1. So we can write it as (x + b)² + c. Let me expand (x + b)² + c to see what it looks like. That would be x² + 2bx + b² + c. Comparing this to the original quadratic x² + 2.6x + 3.6, the coefficients must be equal. So the coefficient of x² is 1 in both, which matches. Then the coefficient of x: 2b should equal 2.6. And the constant term: b² + c should equal 3.6.

So first, solve for b from 2b = 2.6. That should be straightforward. Then use that value of b to solve for c from b² + c = 3.6. Then add b and c together.

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Let me compute b first. If 2b = 2.6, then dividing both sides by 2 gives b = 2.6 / 2.
Let me do that division. 2.6 divided by 2 is 1.3. So b = 1.3.

Now, plug that into the equation for the constant term.

<prompt_2.1> Calculate the value of c using the equation b² + c = 3.6 as per the above plan. </prompt_2.1>
-----

Wait, let me confirm that. Let's substitute b = 1.3 back into the original quadratic and see if it matches.

<prompt_2.2> Verify the solution by substituting b = 1.3 back into the original quadratic equation as per the above plan. </prompt_2.2>

Alternatively, maybe I can use another method to verify. Let's expand (x + 1.3)² + 0.05.

<prompt_2.3> Use expansion and comparison to verify the solution as per the above plan. </prompt_2.3>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
So, b² + c = 3.6. Therefore, c = 3.6 - b². Since b is 1.3, compute b squared. 1.3 squared. Let me calculate that. 1.3 * 1.3. Hmm, 1*1 is 1, 1*0.3 is 0.3, 0.3*1 is 0.3, and 0.3*0.3 is 0.09. Adding those up: 1 + 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.09. That equals 1 + 0.6 + 0.09 = 1.69. So 1.3 squared is 1.69. Therefore, c = 3.6 - 1.69. Let me subtract that. 3.6 minus 1.69. 3.6 is the same as 3.60. 3.60 - 1.69. Subtract 1 from 3.60, get 2.60. Then subtract 0.69 from 2.60. 2.60 - 0.69 is 1.91. So c = 1.91.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
If we take (x + 1.3)² + 0.05, expanding the square gives x² + 2.6x + 1.69 + 0.05. Adding 1.69 and 0.05 gives 1.74. So the quadratic becomes x² + 2.6x + 1.74.
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
Let's compute (x + 1.3)^2: x² + 2.6x + 1.69. Then adding 0.05 gives x² + 2.6x + 1.69 + 0.05 = x² + 2.6x + 1.74. Which is the original quadratic. So that's correct.

Therefore, b is 1.3 and c is 0.05, so their sum is 1.35. That seems correct.

Wait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Let's redo the steps.

Original quadratic: x² + 2.6x + 3.6. To complete the square, take the coefficient of x, which is 2.6, divide by 2 to get 1.3. Then square that: (1.3)^2. Let's compute 1.3 squared.

1.3 * 1.3: 1*1 = 1, 1*0.3 = 0.3, 0.3*1 = 0.3, 0.3*0.3 = 0.09. Adding those up: 1 + 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.09 = 1.69. So 1.3 squared is 1.69. Then, to get back to the original constant term, which is 3.6, we have b² + c = 3.6.

Based on execution_2.1:
Wait, 3.6 minus 1.69. Let me check that again. 3.6 minus 1 is 2.6, then minus 0.69. 2.6 - 0.69.
Let me do that step by step. 2.6 is the same as 2.5 + 0.1. Subtract 0.69 from 2.5 + 0.1. 2.5 - 0.69 is 1.81, and then adding 0.1 gives 1.91. So yes, c = 1.91.

So now, b is 1.3 and c is 1.91. Therefore, b + c is 1.3 + 1.91. Let me add those.
1.3 + 1.91. Adding the decimal parts first: 0.3 + 0.91 = 1.21. Then add the whole numbers: 1 + 1 = 2. Then total is 2 + 1.21 = 3.21. So 3.21.

Wait, but let me check that again. 1.3 + 1.91. Line them up:

<prompt_3.1> Re-add b and c to verify the sum as per the above plan. </prompt_3.1>

But just to be thorough, let me check all steps once more. Maybe I made a mistake in calculation. Let's start over.

<prompt_3.2> Re-evaluate all steps to ensure no calculation mistakes as per the above plan. </prompt_3.2>

1.3
+1.91
--------
2.21

Wait, that's different. Wait, what's going on here. Wait, 1.3 is the same as 1.30. 1.30 + 1.91. 1 + 1 is 2. 0.30 + 0.91 is 1.21. So 2 + 1.21 is 3.21. But when I line them up vertically, it's 1.3 + 1.91. Let's see:

1.3 is 1.30
+1.91
= (1 + 1) + (0.30 + 0.91) = 2 + 1.21 = 3.21.

Wait, so why did I get 2.21 earlier? Because I misaligned the decimals. Wait, no. If I write 1.3 as 1.3 and add to 1.91:

1.3
+1.91
Start from the right: 0 + 1 is 1. Then 3 + 9 is 12, carryover 1. Then 1 + 1 + carried over 1 is 3. So it's 3.21. So the correct sum is 3.21. My initial vertical addition was correct, but when I did it step by step earlier, I must have miscalculated. So the correct sum is 3.21.

<execution_3.2>
Original quadratic: x² + 2.6x + 3.6. We need to write it in the form (x + b)² + c.

Expanding (x + b)² + c gives x² + 2bx + b² + c. Comparing coefficients:

- Coefficient of x²: 1 in both, so that's okay.
- Coefficient of x: 2b = 2.6 ⇒ b = 2.6 / 2 = 1.3.
- Constant term: b² + c = 3.6 ⇒ (1.3)² + c = 3.6 ⇒ 1.69 + c = 3.6 ⇒ c = 3.6 - 1.69 = 1.91.

Therefore, b + c = 1.3 + 1.91 = 3.21.

Based on execution_3.1:
But let me verify this by plugging back into the equation. If b is 1.3 and c is 1.91, then (x + 1.3)² + 1.91 should equal the original quadratic.

<prompt_4.1> Verify the sum b + c by comparing the expanded form with the original quadratic as per the above plan. </prompt_4.1>

Based on execution_3.2:
Wait, but let me just confirm once again. Maybe there's a different way to check. Let's compute (x + 1.3)² + 0.05.

<prompt_4.2> Finalize the solution by confirming the result through multiple checks as per the above plan. </prompt_4.2>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
Expanding (x + 1.3)² gives x² + 2.6x + 1.69. Adding 1.91 gives x² + 2.6x + 1.69 + 1.91 = x² + 2.6x + 3.6, which matches the original quadratic. So that's correct.

Therefore, the answer is 3.21.
</execution_4.1>

<execution_4.2>
Wait, no, we already confirmed that c is 1.91. Wait, maybe I confused something. Wait, no, in the original calculation, c was 1.91. Wait, but when I expanded (x + 1.3)² + 0.05, that was a miscalculation. Wait, no. Wait, hold on. Wait, in the problem statement, the quadratic is x² + 2.6x + 3.6. When we complete the square, we have (x + 1.3)² + (3.6 - 1.69) = (x + 1.3)² + 1.91. So c is 1.91, not 0.05. Wait, but in my earlier check, I must have miscalculated. Let me redo that.

Wait, (x + 1.3)² is x² + 2.6x + 1.69. Then adding 1.91 gives x² + 2.6x + 1.69 + 1.91 = x² + 2.6x + 3.6. That's correct. So c is indeed 1.91. So my previous check was wrong when I wrote 0.05. That was a mistake. So the correct expansion is (x + 1.3)² + 1.91, which gives the original quadratic. Therefore, c is 1.91, so b + c is 1.3 + 1.91 = 3.21.

Therefore, the answer should be 3.21. Let me just confirm once again with decimal addition:

1.3 + 1.91. Let's add the decimal parts first: 0.3 + 0.91 = 1.21. Then add the whole numbers: 1 + 1 = 2. Then total is 2 + 1.21 = 3.21. Yep.

Alternatively, 1.3 is the same as 1 + 0.3, and 1.91 is 1 + 0.91. So adding them: (1 + 1) + (0.3 + 0.91) = 2 + 1.21 = 3.21.

Therefore, I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in the steps now. So b + c is 3.21.

<Final_answer>
Therefore, $b + c = \boxed{3.21}$.
