Okay, so I need to find the distance between two parallel lines in 3D space. Hmm, let me recall how to do that. I think the formula involves the cross product of the direction vectors and maybe a vector connecting a point from each line. Let me try to remember the exact method.

<prompt_1.1> Recall the formula for finding the distance between two parallel lines in 3D space. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
First, since the lines are parallel, their direction vectors must be scalar multiples of each other. Let me check that. The first line has a direction vector of (2, -9, -2), and the second line has (4, -18, -4). Oh, right, if you multiply the first direction vector by 2, you get (4, -18, -4), which is exactly the second direction vector. So they are indeed parallel. That's good, otherwise, if they weren't parallel, the distance would be more complicated to compute.

Now, the formula for the distance between two parallel lines is the length of the cross product of the direction vector and the vector connecting a point from each line, divided by the magnitude of the direction vector. Wait, no, maybe it's the magnitude of the cross product divided by the magnitude of the direction vector? Let me think. Alternatively, another way to remember is that the distance is the area of the parallelogram formed by the vectors divided by the base, which would be the magnitude of the cross product divided by the magnitude of the direction vector. Hmm, perhaps not. Wait, actually, the formula is |(P2 - P1) ⋅ (d × (P2 - P1))| / |d|, but I might be mixing things up. Maybe I need to look at the standard formula.

Wait, let me derive it. The distance between two parallel lines is the minimal distance between any two points on the lines. Since the lines are parallel, the minimal distance occurs along a line segment that is perpendicular to both lines. So, if I take a vector connecting a point on the first line to a point on the second line, say vector w = P2 - P1, where P1 is a point on the first line and P2 is a point on the second line. Then, the distance is the length of the component of w that is perpendicular to the direction vector d. That can be computed as |w × d| / |d|.

Wait, let's see. Let me confirm.

</Execution_1>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
If we have two vectors, w and d, the cross product w × d gives a vector perpendicular to both, and its magnitude is |w||d|sin(theta), where theta is the angle between them. Then, dividing by |d| gives |w|sin(theta), which is the height of the parallelogram formed by w and d, which is indeed the minimal distance between the lines. So yes, the formula should be |(P2 - P1) × d| / |d|.

Wait, but let me check with an example.

<prompt_2.1> Verify the derived formula for the distance between two parallel lines using an example. </prompt_2.1>

So, applying this formula to the given lines.

First, let's identify P1 and P2.

<prompt_2.2> Apply the distance formula to the given parallel lines using their points and direction vectors. </prompt_2.2>

But let me check if there's another way to approach this, just to verify.

Alternatively, since the lines are parallel, we can also find the distance by finding a plane perpendicular to the direction vector that contains one line and then finding the distance from the other line to this plane.

<prompt_2.3> Explore an alternative method to find the distance between the lines using a plane perpendicular to the direction vector. </prompt_2.3>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Suppose two lines: first line through point A(1,0,0) with direction vector (1,0,0), second line through point B(0,1,0) with same direction vector. Then, vector AB is (-1,1,0). The cross product AB × d is (-1,1,0) × (1,0,0) = (0*0 - 1*0, 0*1 - (-1)*0, (-1)*0 - 1*0) = (0,0,1). The magnitude is 1. Divided by |d| which is 1, gives distance 1, which is correct. The minimal distance between (1,0,0) + t(1,0,0) and (0,1,0) + u(1,0,0) is indeed 1.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
For the first line, when t=0, the point P1 is (3, -10, 1). For the second line, when u=0, the point P2 is (-5, -3, 6). So the vector w = P2 - P1 is (-5 - 3, -3 - (-10), 6 - 1) = (-8, 7, 5).

The direction vector d is (2, -9, -2). Then, we need to compute the cross product of w and d, then take its magnitude, and divide by the magnitude of d.

First, let's compute the cross product w × d. Given w = (-8, 7, 5) and d = (2, -9, -2).

The cross product is calculated as:

|i   j   k|
|-8  7   5|
|2 -9 -2|

Which is i*(7*(-2) - 5*(-9)) - j*(-8*(-2) - 5*2) + k*(-8*(-9) - 7*2)

Calculating each component:

i component: 7*(-2) = -14; 5*(-9) = -45; so -14 - (-45) = -14 + 45 = 31. So i*31.

j component: - [ (-8)*(-2) - 5*2 ] = - [ 16 - 10 ] = - [6] = -6. So -j*6.

k component: (-8)*(-9) = 72; 7*2 = 14; so 72 - 14 = 58. So k*58.

Therefore, w × d = (31, -6, 58).

Now, compute the magnitude of this cross product:

|w × d| = sqrt(31² + (-6)² + 58²) = sqrt(961 + 36 + 3364) = sqrt(961 + 36 is 997, 997 + 3364 is 4361). So sqrt(4361).

Then, compute |d|: sqrt(2² + (-9)² + (-2)²) = sqrt(4 + 81 + 4) = sqrt(89).

Therefore, the distance is sqrt(4361)/sqrt(89). Let's simplify that.

First, note that 4361 divided by 89. Let's check if 89 divides into 4361.

89*49 = 89*50 - 89 = 4450 - 89 = 4361. So 4361/89 = 49. Therefore, sqrt(4361)/sqrt(89) = sqrt(49) = 7.
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
Let me try that approach as a cross-check.

First, the direction vector is d = (2, -9, -2). A plane perpendicular to this direction vector would have a normal vector of (2, -9, -2). So the equation of the plane can be written as 2(x - x0) -9(y - y0) -2(z - z0) = 0, where (x0, y0, z0) is a point on the plane. Let's take the point on the first line when t=0, which is (3, -10, 1). So the plane equation is 2(x - 3) -9(y +10) -2(z -1) = 0. Let's expand that:

2x -6 -9y -90 -2z +2 = 0

Combine terms:

2x -9y -2z -6 -90 +2 = 0 => 2x -9y -2z -94 = 0.

So the plane equation is 2x -9y -2z = 94.

Now, the distance from the second line to this plane should be the same as the distance between the lines. Let's pick a point on the second line, say when u=0, which is (-5, -3, 6). The distance from this point to the plane 2x -9y -2z = 94 is |2*(-5) -9*(-3) -2*6 -94| / sqrt(2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2).

Compute numerator:

2*(-5) = -10

-9*(-3) = 27

-2*6 = -12

So, -10 +27 -12 -94 = (-10 +27) = 17; 17 -12 =5; 5 -94= -89. Absolute value is 89.

Denominator:

sqrt(4 +81 +4) = sqrt(90 +4) = sqrt(94). Wait, 4 +81 is 85, plus 4 is 89. So sqrt(89). Wait, sqrt(89) is approximately 9.433, but exact value is sqrt(89).

Wait, so the distance is 89 / sqrt(89) = sqrt(89). Which matches the previous result. Therefore, the distance is sqrt(89).

Wait, but let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.

First, vector w = P2 - P1 = (-5 -3, -3 - (-10), 6 -1) = (-8,7,5). Correct.

Based on execution_2.3:
Wait, but earlier I had 7. Let me check which one is correct. Wait, sqrt(89) is approximately 9.433, but when I calculated cross product method, I got 7. There's a discrepancy here. Wait, that means I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let's check the cross product method again.

<prompt_3.2> Identify and correct the mistake in the cross product method. </prompt_3.2>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
Direction vector d = (2, -9, -2). Correct.

Cross product calculation:

i component: 7*(-2) - 5*(-9) = -14 +45 = 31. Correct.

j component: - [ (-8)*(-2) -5*2 ] = - [16 -10] = -6. Correct.

k component: (-8)*(-9) -7*2 = 72 -14 =58. Correct. So cross product is (31, -6, 58). Correct.

Magnitude of cross product: 31² = 961, (-6)^2=36, 58²=3364. Sum is 961 +36=997, 997 +3364=4361. sqrt(4361). Then |d|=sqrt(2² + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2)=sqrt(4+81+4)=sqrt(89). Then sqrt(4361)/sqrt(89). Then 4361 divided by 89 is 49, so sqrt(49)=7. Correct.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
First, w = (-8,7,5), d=(2,-9,-2). Cross product:

i component: 7*(-2) -5*(-9) = -14 +45=31. Correct.

j component: - [ (-8)*(-2) -5*2 ] = - [16 -10] = -6. So the j component is -6. Correct.

k component: (-8)*(-9) -7*2=72 -14=58. Correct. So cross product is (31, -6,58). Then |w × d| = sqrt(31² + (-6)^2 +58^2)=sqrt(961 +36 +3364)=sqrt(4361). Then |d|=sqrt(2² + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2)=sqrt(4+81+4)=sqrt(89). Then sqrt(4361)/sqrt(89)=sqrt(4361/89)=sqrt(49)=7. So that gives 7. But in the plane method, I got sqrt(89). These can't both be right. So one of the methods must have an error.

Wait, but in the plane method, I found the plane equation using the first point (3,-10,1). Then computed the distance from the second point (-5,-3,6) to that plane. But wait, the second line is supposed to be parallel to the first line, which lies on the plane. So the distance from the second line to the plane should be the same as the distance between the lines. However, according to the calculation, it's 89 / sqrt(89) = sqrt(89). But according to the cross product method, it's 7. So which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the plane equation. Let me recheck the plane equation.

The plane is defined by the first line. The first line has point (3,-10,1) and direction vector (2,-9,-2). So the plane equation is indeed 2(x -3) -9(y +10) -2(z -1)=0. Let's expand that again:

2x -6 -9y -90 -2z +2 =0. Combine constants: -6 -90 +2 = -94. So 2x -9y -2z -94=0. So the equation is 2x -9y -2z =94. Then, plugging in the second point (-5,-3,6):

Left side: 2*(-5) -9*(-3) -2*6 = -10 +27 -12 =5. Then |5 -94|=89. So 89/sqrt(2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2)=89/sqrt(4+81+4)=89/sqrt(89)=sqrt(89). So that's correct.

But according to the cross product method, the distance is 7. These two results should be equal. Therefore, there must be an error in one of the methods.

But wait, when I calculated the cross product, I had (31, -6, 58). Let me confirm that cross product again.

Wait, maybe the cross product method is wrong. Wait, let me check the formula again.

<prompt_4.2> Re-evaluate the cross product method and identify any errors. </prompt_4.2>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
The cross product formula is:

For vectors (a1, a2, a3) and (b1, b2, b3), the cross product is:

(a2b3 - a3b2, a3b1 - a1b3, a1b2 - a2b1)

So, using this formula:

First component: a2b3 - a3b2 = 7*(-2) -5*(-9) = -14 +45=31. Correct.

Second component: a3b1 - a1b3 =5*2 - (-8)*(-2)=10 -16= -6. Wait, but according to the cross product formula, the second component is negative of (a1b3 - a3b1). Wait, maybe I messed up the sign. Let me check again. The cross product formula is:

i (a2b3 - a3b2) - j (a1b3 - a3b1) + k (a1b2 - a2b1)

So, the second component is negative of (a1b3 - a3b1). So in this case, a1= -8, b3= -2, a3=5, b1=2. So a1b3 - a3b1 = (-8)*(-2) -5*2=16 -10=6. Then, the second component is -6. Correct. So that's right.

Third component: a1b2 - a2b1 = (-8)*(-9) -7*2=72 -14=58. Correct.

So cross product is indeed (31, -6, 58). Then the magnitude is sqrt(31² + (-6)^2 +58²)=sqrt(961 +36 +3364)=sqrt(4361). Then |d|=sqrt(89). Then 4361 divided by 89 is 49. So sqrt(49)=7. Correct.
</execution_4.1>

<execution_4.2>
If the lines are parallel, then the distance is |(Q - P) ⋅ (d × n)| / |d|, where n is the unit direction vector? Wait, no. Wait, actually, when the lines are parallel, the minimal distance is |(Q - P) × d| / |d|, but only if the direction vector is a unit vector? Wait, no, that formula should hold regardless. Wait, but in our case, the direction vector is (2, -9, -2), which is not a unit vector. So let me re-examine the cross product method.

Wait, the formula for the distance between two parallel lines is |(Q - P) × d| / |d|. Wait, but in our case, (Q - P) is the vector connecting the two points, and d is the direction vector. So the formula is correct. But according to that, we get 7, but according to the plane distance, we get sqrt(89). But sqrt(89) is approximately 9.433, which is different from 7. So which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the cross product. Let me recompute the cross product.

Given w = (-8,7,5) and d = (2,-9,-2). The cross product is:

i component: (7)(-2) - (5)(-9) = -14 +45 =31. Correct.

j component: - [ ( -8)(-2) - (5)(2) ] = - [16 -10] = -6. Correct.

k component: (-8)(-9) - (7)(2) =72 -14=58. Correct. So cross product is (31, -6,58). Then |cross product| is sqrt(31² + (-6)^2 +58²)=sqrt(961 +36 +3364)=sqrt(4361). Then |d|=sqrt(2² + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2)=sqrt(4+81+4)=sqrt(89). Then sqrt(4361)/sqrt(89)=sqrt(4361/89)=sqrt(49)=7. So that seems correct. But the plane method gives sqrt(89). Therefore, there must be a mistake in one of the methods. Let me check the plane method again.

Wait, the plane equation: the first line is on the plane 2x -9y -2z =94. Then, the second line is parallel to the first line, so all points on the second line should satisfy the plane equation? Wait, no, because if the lines are parallel, they can either lie on the same plane (if they are coincident) or be parallel but offset, in which case they lie on parallel planes. Wait, but in this case, the second line is not on the same plane. Therefore, the distance from the second line to the plane of the first line is indeed the distance between the lines. So that method should be correct. But according to that, the distance is 89/sqrt(89)=sqrt(89). But according to the cross product method, it's 7. These two results must be equal if both methods are correct. But 7 is not equal to sqrt(89). Therefore, there's a mistake here.

Wait, but sqrt(89) is approximately 9.433, and 7 is 7. So they are different. Therefore, one of the methods must be wrong.

Wait, according to my notes, the distance between two parallel lines is |(Q - P) ⋅ (d × n)| / |d|, but I might be mixing up different formulas. Wait, perhaps the correct formula is |(Q - P) ⋅ (d × n)| / |d|, where n is a unit vector perpendicular to d. Wait, no, perhaps the formula is |(Q - P) ⋅ (d × (Q - P))| / |d|. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me check. Wait, actually, the formula for the distance between two parallel lines is |(Q - P) × d| / |d|. Wait, but let me refer to the standard formula. 

Wait, according to standard references, the distance between two parallel lines can be found by taking the norm of the cross product of (Q - P) and d divided by the norm of d. So |(Q - P) × d| / |d|. Therefore, that formula should be correct. So if that gives 7, but the plane method gives sqrt(89), then there's a problem. Wait, but sqrt(89) is approximately 9.433, which is not 7. Therefore, there must be a mistake in one of the methods. 

Wait, but let's check the cross product calculation again. Let me compute 31^2 + (-6)^2 +58^2:

31^2 = 961

(-6)^2 =36

58^2=3364

Sum:961 +36=997; 997+3364=4361. So sqrt(4361)=66.05... Then divide by sqrt(89)=9.433... So 66.05 /9.433≈7. Therefore, sqrt(4361)/sqrt(89)=sqrt(4361/89)=sqrt(49)=7. So that's correct. Therefore, the cross product method gives 7. But the plane method gives sqrt(89). Therefore, there's a discrepancy. 

But wait, in the plane method, I computed the distance from the point (-5,-3,6) to the plane 2x -9y -2z=94, which is |2*(-5) -9*(-3) -2*6 -94| / sqrt(2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2). Wait, wait a second. Wait, the plane equation is 2x -9y -2z=94. So when computing the distance, the formula is |2x -9y -2z -94| / sqrt(2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2). So plugging in the point (-5,-3,6):

2*(-5) = -10

-9*(-3)=27

-2*6= -12

So total: -10 +27 -12 =5. Then 5 -94= -89. Absolute value 89. Then 89 divided by sqrt(89) is sqrt(89). But according to the cross product method, the distance is 7. 

But sqrt(89) is approximately 9.433, which is not equal to 7. Therefore, there's a mistake here.

<execution_6.1>
First line: (3, -10, 1) + t(2, -9, -2)

Second line: (-5, -3, 6) + s(4, -18, -4)

The vector connecting a point on the first line to a point on the second line is (-5 -3 +2t, -3 +10 -9t, 6 -1 +2t) = (-8 +2t, 7 -9t, 5 +2t). The square of the distance between the lines is the minimal value of the square of this vector as t and s vary. But since the lines are parallel, the minimal distance occurs when the vector connecting the points is perpendicular to the direction vector. 

Wait, but since the lines are parallel, the minimal distance is the minimal value of the distance between any two points on the lines. To find this, we can set up the distance squared as a function of t and s, then minimize it. But since the lines are parallel, the minimal distance should be independent of the parameterization. Wait, but actually, since the lines are parallel, we can fix one parameter and express the other in terms. 

Alternatively, since the lines are parallel, we can set t = s because the direction vectors are scalar multiples. Wait, but in the second line, the direction vector is 4, -18, -4, which is 2*(2, -9, -2). So if we let the second line be parametrized with parameter u, then to align the direction, perhaps we can express the second line as (-5, -3, 6) + u*(2, -9, -2). Let me adjust the second line's parameterization:

Original second line: 

\[\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\]

But 4 = 2*2, -18 = 2*(-9), -4 = 2*(-2). So this is equivalent to:

\[\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u*2 \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\]

So if we let u = t/2, then the second line can be written as:

\[\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\]

Therefore, both lines can be parametrized with the same direction vector (2, -9, -2) and parameters t and s (which are related by s = t/2). 

Now, the vector between a point on the first line (when t=0) and a point on the second line (when s=0) is from (3, -10, 1) to (-5, -3, 6), which is (-8, 7, 5). Then, to find the minimal distance, we can project this vector onto the direction perpendicular to the lines. 

The formula for the distance is |(P2 - P1) ⋅ d| / |d|, but wait, no. Wait, actually, the distance is |(P2 - P1) × d| / |d|. Wait, but according to the cross product method, we have |w × d| / |d|, which gave 7. But according to the plane method, it's sqrt(89). But these should be equal. Therefore, there must be a mistake in one of the calculations.

w × d = (31, -6, 58). Then |w × d| = sqrt(31² + (-6)² +58²) = sqrt(961 + 36 + 3364) = sqrt(4361). Then |d|=sqrt(89). Then sqrt(4361)/sqrt(89) = sqrt(4361/89) = sqrt(49) =7. So that seems correct. 

But the plane method gave sqrt(89). Therefore, there's a contradiction. 

Wait, but maybe the plane method was miscalculated. Let me check again. 

The plane equation: using point (3, -10, 1) and normal vector d=(2, -9, -2). The plane equation is 2(x -3) -9(y +10) -2(z -1)=0. Expanding:

2x -6 -9y -90 -2z +2=0 → 2x -9y -2z -94=0. So 2x -9y -2z=94. Then, plugging in the point (-5, -3,6):

Left side: 2*(-5) -9*(-3) -2*6 = -10 +27 -12=5. Then 5 -94= -89. Absolute value 89. Then divided by sqrt(2² + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2)=sqrt(4+81+4)=sqrt(89). So 89/sqrt(89)=sqrt(89). 

But according to cross product, it's 7. Therefore, there's a problem.

Based on execution_7.1:
Wait, perhaps the issue is that the cross product formula gives the distance when the lines are not parallel? No, the formula is specifically for parallel lines. Wait, but the lines are parallel, so the formula should apply. 

Alternatively, perhaps the cross product method is wrong because the vector w is not from the same point? Wait, no. The vector between the two points is w, and the direction vector is d. The formula |w × d| / |d| should give the distance. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the cross product. Let me compute 31^2 again: 31*31=961. (-6)^2=36. 58^2=58*58. Let's compute 58^2: 50^2=2500, 8^2=64, 2*50*8=800. So (50+8)^2=2500 +800 +64=3364. Correct. 

So 961 +36=997, 997 +3364=4361. Then 4361 divided by 89 is 49. So sqrt(49)=7. So that's correct. 

But the plane method gives sqrt(89). Therefore, there's a contradiction. 

Alternatively, perhaps the plane method is incorrect. Let me check again. 

The plane equation is 2x -9y -2z=94. Then, the distance from the point (-5,-3,6) to this plane is |2*(-5) -9*(-3) -2*6 -94| / sqrt(2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2).

-9*(-3)=27

-2*6= -12

So total: -10 +27 -12=5. Then 5 -94= -89. Absolute value is 89. Denominator is sqrt(4 +81 +4)=sqrt(89). So 89/sqrt(89)=sqrt(89).
