<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to find the minimum value of the expression \(\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{4}{c} + \frac{16}{d}\) given that \(a + b + c + d = 1\) and all variables are positive real numbers. Hmm, this seems like an optimization problem with a constraint. I remember that in such cases, methods like Lagrange multipliers can be useful. But since all the terms are positive and the constraint is a sum equal to 1, maybe there's a way to apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or the AM-HM inequality. Let me think through this step by step.

First, let's recall the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in the form that might be applicable here. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any non-negative real numbers \(x_i\) and \(y_i\), we have:
\[
\left( \sum x_i y_i \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum x_i^2 \right) \left( \sum y_i^2 \right)
\]
But how can I apply this here? Alternatively, there's the method of weighted AM-HM inequality. The harmonic mean is involved here because of the reciprocals in the expression. Let me consider the AM-HM inequality for each variable.

The AM-HM inequality states that for positive real numbers, the arithmetic mean is at least the harmonic mean. Specifically, for variables \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\),
\[
\frac{a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_n}{n} \geq \frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_1} + \frac{1}{a_2} + \ldots + \frac{1}{a_n}}
\]
But in our problem, the coefficients of the reciprocals are different: 1, 1, 4, 16. So maybe I need to use a weighted version of the AM-HM inequality.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in the following way. Suppose I consider the expression \(\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{4}{c} + \frac{16}{d}\).
If I can relate this to the sum \(a + b + c + d\) through Cauchy-Schwarz, that might work.

Let me recall that for any vectors \( \mathbf{u} \) and \( \mathbf{v} \), the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality is:
\[
\left( \sum_{i=1}^n u_i v_i \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{i=1}^n u_i^2 \right) \left( \sum_{i=1}^n v_i^2 \right)
\]
But how to apply this here. Let's consider the sum \(a + b + c + d = 1\). Maybe I can set up two vectors such that their dot product relates to the expression we want to minimize.

Alternatively, perhaps using the AM-GM inequality. The AM-GM inequality states that for non-negative real numbers, the arithmetic mean is at least the geometric mean. But since we have a sum constraint, maybe we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers after all. Let's try that approach.

Let me set up the Lagrangian. Let \(f(a, b, c, d) = \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{4}{c} + \frac{16}{d}\) be the function to minimize, and the constraint is \(g(a, b, c, d) = a + b + c + d - 1 = 0\). The Lagrangian is:
\[
\mathcal{L}(a, b, c, d, \lambda) = \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{4}{c} + \frac{16}{d} + \lambda(1 - a - b - c - d)
\]

To find the critical points, we take the partial derivatives with respect to each variable and set them equal to zero.

<prompt_1.1> Set up the Lagrangian and calculate the partial derivatives with respect to each variable. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
First, the partial derivative with respect to \(a\):
\[
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial a} = -\frac{1}{a^2} - \lambda = 0
\]
Similarly, with respect to \(b\):
\[
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial b} = -\frac{1}{b^2} - \lambda = 0
\]
With respect to \(c\):
\[
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial c} = -\frac{4}{c^2} - \lambda = 0
\]
With respect to \(d\):
\[
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial d} = -\frac{16}{d^2} - \lambda = 0
\]
And with respect to \(\lambda\):
\[
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \lambda} = 1 - a - b - c - d = 0
\]
So from the partial derivatives with respect to \(a, b, c, d\), we get the equations:
1. \(-\frac{1}{a^2} - \lambda = 0\)
2. \(-\frac{1}{b^2} - \lambda = 0\)
3. \(-\frac{4}{c^2} - \lambda = 0\)
4. \(-\frac{16}{d^2} - \lambda = 0\)

From equations 1 and 2, we can see that \(\frac{1}{a^2} = \frac{1}{b^2}\), which implies \(a = b\) since they are positive. Similarly, equations 3 and 4 give \(\frac{4}{c^2} = \frac{16}{d^2}\), which simplifies to \(\frac{1}{c^2} = \frac{4}{d^2}\), so \(d = 2c\).
</execution_1.1>
</Execution_1>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
So now we can express \(b = a\) and \(d = 2c\). Let's substitute these into the constraint equation \(a + b + c + d = 1\):

<prompt_2.1> Substitute \(b = a\) and \(d = 2c\) into the constraint equation and solve for \(a\) in terms of \(c\). </prompt_2.1>
-----

Based on execution_1.1:
But wait, let me verify this again. When I set up the Lagrangian, the partial derivatives gave me relationships between the variables. Let me confirm that the critical point found is indeed a minimum.

<prompt_2.2> Verify that the critical point found using Lagrangian multipliers is indeed a minimum. </prompt_2.2>

Alternatively, let's try using the AM-HM inequality. The expression we need to minimize is \(\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{4}{c} + \frac{16}{d}\). Let's consider the terms as weighted reciprocals. Maybe we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in the following form:

<prompt_2.3> Use the AM-HM inequality to verify the minimum value of the expression. </prompt_2.3>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
\(a + a + c + 2c = 1\)  
Simplifies to:
\(2a + 3c = 1\)

Now, we have two variables \(a\) and \(c\) related by \(2a + 3c = 1\). Let's express one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for \(a\):
\(2a = 1 - 3c\)  
\(a = \frac{1 - 3c}{2}\)

But since all variables must be positive, we have constraints:
\(a > 0 \Rightarrow \frac{1 - 3c}{2} > 0 \Rightarrow 1 - 3c > 0 \Rightarrow c < \frac{1}{3}\)
Also, \(c > 0\), so \(0 < c < \frac{1}{3}\).
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Since the function is convex (the Hessian matrix would be positive definite for positive variables), the critical point found should be the global minimum. Alternatively, we can check the second derivatives, but given the structure of the problem, it's safe to assume that this is the minimum.
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
For any positive real numbers \(x_i\) and positive weights \(k_i\), the following inequality holds:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^n k_i x_i \geq \frac{(\sum_{i=1}^n \sqrt{k_i})^2}{\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{x_i}}
\]
Wait, maybe not exactly. Let me recall the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in the form:
\[
\left( \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{a_i^2}{b_i} \right) \geq \frac{(\sum_{i=1}^n a_i)^2}{\sum_{i=1}^n b_i}
\]
Yes, that's the form of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality applied to sequences \((a_i)\) and \((\sqrt{b_i})\). Alternatively, it's the Titu's lemma, which is a particular case of Cauchy-Schwarz.

So, applying Titu's lemma to the expression \(\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{4}{c} + \frac{16}{d}\), we can write it as:
\[
\frac{1^2}{a} + \frac{1^2}{b} + \frac{2^2}{c} + \frac{4^2}{d}
\]
Then, by Titu's lemma:
\[
\frac{1^2}{a} + \frac{1^2}{b} + \frac{2^2}{c} + \frac{4^2}{d} \geq \frac{(1 + 1 + 2 + 4)^2}{a + b + c + d}
\]
Calculating the numerator: \(1 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 8\), so squared is \(64\). The denominator is \(a + b + c + d = 1\). Therefore, the inequality gives:
\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{4}{c} + \frac{16}{d} \geq \frac{64}{1} = 64
\]
So, the minimum value is 64, achieved when the conditions for equality in Titu's lemma hold. Equality in Titu's lemma occurs when \(\frac{a_i}{b_i}\) is constant for all \(i\). In other words, when \(\frac{1}{a} = \frac{1}{b} = \frac{2}{c} = \frac{4}{d}\). Let's denote this common ratio by \(k\), so:
\[
\frac{1}{a} = \frac{1}{b} = \frac{2}{c} = \frac{4}{d} = k
\]
Which implies:
\[
a = \frac{1}{k}, \quad b = \frac{1}{k}, \quad c = \frac{2}{k}, \quad d = \frac{4}{k}
\]
Substituting into the constraint \(a + b + c + d = 1\):
\[
\frac{1}{k} + \frac{1}{k} + \frac{2}{k} + \frac{4}{k} = \frac{8}{k} = 1 \implies k = 8
\]
Therefore, the values are:
\[
a = \frac{1}{8}, \quad b = \frac{1}{8}, \quad c = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4}, \quad d = \frac{4}{8} = \frac{1}{2}
\]
Which matches the earlier results from the Lagrangian method.

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Now, substitute \(a = \frac{1 - 3c}{2}\) into the expression we want to minimize. Let me write the original expression in terms of \(a\) and \(c\):

<prompt_3.1> Substitute \(a = \frac{1 - 3c}{2}\) into the expression \(\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{4}{c} + \frac{16}{d}\) and simplify. </prompt_3.1>
-----

Based on execution_2.3:
Therefore, whether using the method of Lagrange multipliers or applying Titu's lemma (a form of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality), we arrive at the same minimal value of 64.
This cross-verification is reassuring.

Let me just check once more by plugging in different values.

<prompt_3.2> Perform a final verification of the solution by considering different values and checking if they satisfy the constraints. </prompt_3.2>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{4}{c} + \frac{16}{d} = \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{a} + \frac{4}{c} + \frac{16}{2c}
\]
Simplify the terms:
\[
= \frac{2}{a} + \frac{4}{c} + \frac{8}{c} = \frac{2}{a} + \frac{12}{c}
\]
Now, substitute \(a = \frac{1 - 3c}{2}\):
\[
\frac{2}{\frac{1 - 3c}{2}} + \frac{12}{c} = \frac{4}{1 - 3c} + \frac{12}{c}
\]
So, the expression to minimize becomes a function of \(c\):
\[
f(c) = \frac{4}{1 - 3c} + \frac{12}{c}
\]
Now, we need to find the minimum of \(f(c)\) for \(0 < c < \frac{1}{3}\).
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
Suppose I take a different set of values. Let's say, if I take a = b = 0.2, c = 0.3, d = 0.4. Then a + b + c + d = 0.2 + 0.2 + 0.3 + 0.4 = 1.1, which is more than 1, so that's not allowed. Let me adjust to a = b = 0.25, c = 0.25, d = 0.25. Then the sum is 1. The expression would be 4 + 4 + 16 + 25 = 49, which is higher than 64. Hmm, not lower. If I take a = b = 1/8, c = 1/4, d = 1/2, then the sum is 1, and the expression is 8 + 8 + 4 + 16 = 36. If I slightly perturb these values, say increase a and b a bit and decrease c and d accordingly, would the expression increase? Let's try a = 0.15, b = 0.15, so a + b = 0.3. Then c + d = 0.7. Let's set c = 0.28, d = 0.42. Then compute the expression: 1/0.15 ≈ 6.666, twice for a and b: 6.666*2 ≈ 13.333. Then 4/0.28 ≈ 14.286, and 16/0.42 ≈ 38.095. Adding these: 13.333 + 14.286 + 38.095 ≈ 65.714, which is higher than 64. So indeed, the minimal value seems to be 64.

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
To find the minimum, take the derivative of \(f(c)\) with respect to \(c\), set it to zero, and solve for \(c\).

First, compute the derivative:
\[
f'(c) = \frac{d}{dc} \left( \frac{4}{1 - 3c} + \frac{12}{c} \right)
\]
Differentiate term by term:

<prompt_4.1> Compute the derivative of \(f(c) = \frac{4}{1 - 3c} + \frac{12}{c}\) and set it to zero to find critical points. </prompt_4.1>
-----

Based on execution_3.2:
**Final Answer**
\boxed{64}
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
For \(\frac{4}{1 - 3c}\):
Let \(u = 1 - 3c\), so \(du/dc = -3\). Then, the derivative is:
\[
\frac{d}{dc} \left( \frac{4}{u} \right) = 4 \cdot \left( -\frac{1}{u^2} \right) \cdot (-3) = \frac{12}{u^2} = \frac{12}{(1 - 3c)^2}
\]

For \(\frac{12}{c}\):
The derivative is \(-\frac{12}{c^2}\).

So, combining these:
\[
f'(c) = \frac{12}{(1 - 3c)^2} - \frac{12}{c^2}
\]
Set the derivative equal to zero:
\[
\frac{12}{(1 - 3c)^2} - \frac{12}{c^2} = 0
\]
Divide both sides by 12:
\[
\frac{1}{(1 - 3c)^2} - \frac{1}{c^2} = 0
\]
Which simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{(1 - 3c)^2} = \frac{1}{c^2}
\]
Taking reciprocals on both sides (since both sides are positive):
\[
(1 - 3c)^2 = c^2
\]
Take square roots of both sides, considering both positive and negative roots:
\[
1 - 3c = \pm c
\]
So, two cases:

1. \(1 - 3c = c\)
2. \(1 - 3c = -c\)

Solving case 1:
\(1 = 4c \Rightarrow c = \frac{1}{4}\)

But wait, earlier we had \(c < \frac{1}{3}\), so \(c = \frac{1}{4}\) is valid since \(\frac{1}{4} < \frac{1}{3}\).

Solving case 2:
\(1 = 2c \Rightarrow c = \frac{1}{2}\)

But \(c = \frac{1}{2}\) is not less than \(\frac{1}{3}\), so this solution is invalid. Therefore, the only critical point is at \(c = \frac{1}{4}\).
</execution_4.1>
</Execution_4>

<Plan_5>
Based on execution_4.1:
Let's check if this is a minimum. We can use the second derivative test or check the behavior of the first derivative around \(c = \frac{1}{4}\).

<prompt_5.1> Use the second derivative test to confirm that \(c = \frac{1}{4}\) is a minimum. </prompt_5.1>
</Plan_5>

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
Let's compute the second derivative \(f''(c)\). However, maybe it's simpler to analyze the first derivative around \(c = 1/4\).

Let me pick a value slightly less than \(1/4\), say \(c = 0.24\). Then, compute \(f'(0.24)\):

First, \(1 - 3c = 1 - 0.72 = 0.28\). Then:

\[
\frac{12}{(0.28)^2} - \frac{12}{(0.24)^2} = \frac{12}{0.0784} - \frac{12}{0.0576} \approx 153.06 - 208.33 ≈ -55.27
\]
So, negative.

Now, take a value slightly more than \(1/4\), say \(c = 0.25\). Wait, but \(c = 0.25\) is exactly \(1/4\). Let's take \(c = 0.26\):

\(1 - 3*0.26 = 1 - 0.78 = 0.22\)

\[
\frac{12}{(0.22)^2} - \frac{12}{(0.26)^2} ≈ \frac{12}{0.0484} - \frac{12}{0.0676} ≈ 248.44 - 177.57 ≈ 70.87
\]
Positive. Therefore, the derivative changes from negative to positive as \(c\) increases through \(1/4\), indicating a minimum at \(c = 1/4\).

Based on execution_5.1:
Now, compute \(a\) using \(a = \frac{1 - 3c}{2}\):

<prompt_6.1> Calculate the minimum value of the expression using \(c = \frac{1}{4}\), \(a = \frac{1 - 3c}{2}\), and \(b = a\), \(d = 2c\). </prompt_6.1>

<Execution_6>
<execution_6.1>
\(c = 1/4\), so:

\(a = \frac{1 - 3*(1/4)}{2} = \frac{1 - 3/4}{2} = \frac{1/4}{2} = 1/8\)

So, \(a = b = 1/8\), \(c = 1/4\), \(d = 2*(1/4) = 1/2\). Then, the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{1/8} + \frac{1}{1/8} + \frac{4}{1/4} + \frac{16}{1/2} = 8 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 64
\]
So, the minimum value is 64.

Based on execution_6.1:
But let me verify once again. Let's compute the expression with these values:

<prompt_7.1> Re-verify the minimum value of the expression with \(a = b = \frac{1}{8}\), \(c = \frac{1}{4}\), and \(d = \frac{1}{2}\). </prompt_7.1>

<Execution_7>
<execution_7.1>
\(1/a = 8\), same for \(1/b = 8\). \(4/c = 4/(1/4) = 16\). \(16/d = 16/(1/2) = 32\). Adding them up: 8 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 64.
</execution_7.1>

Therefore, the minimum value of the given expression is $\boxed{64}$.
