<Question>
A book is said to have $n$ leaves if it is composed of $n$ pieces of paper. On the other hand, the number of pages is twice the number of leaves because each side of a piece of paper is defined as a page.

If the number of pages in a book is $3$ more than a multiple of $7$, and the number of leaves is greater than $100$, then what is the smallest possible number of leaves?

Okay, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the smallest number of leaves in a book where the number of pages is 3 more than a multiple of 7, and the number of leaves is greater than 100. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I need to remember that each leaf is a piece of paper, and each piece of paper has two sides, which are pages. So, if a book has 'n' leaves, the total number of pages would be 2n, right? Because each leaf contributes two pages. Wait, but the problem says the number of pages is 3 more than a multiple of 7. So, the number of pages, which is 2n, should be equal to 7k + 3 for some integer k. And we need to find the smallest n greater than 100 that satisfies this.

Let me write that down:
Number of pages = 2n = 7k + 3, where k is an integer.
And n > 100.

So, we need to solve for n in the equation 2n ≡ 3 mod 7. Because 2n leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 7. Then, find the smallest n greater than 100 that satisfies this congruence.

First, let's solve the congruence equation 2n ≡ 3 mod 7. To find n, we can multiply both sides by the modular inverse of 2 mod 7. The inverse of 2 modulo 7 is a number x such that 2x ≡ 1 mod 7.

<prompt_1.1> Solve the congruence equation 2n ≡ 3 mod 7 to find n. </prompt_1.1>

But wait, let me double-check. Let's take n=105. Then pages=210.

<prompt_1.2> Verify the solution by checking if n=105 and n=112 satisfy the conditions. </prompt_1.2>

<execution_1.1>
Let's test x=4: 2*4=8 ≡ 1 mod 7. Yes, because 8 divided by 7 is 1 with remainder 1. So, the inverse is 4.

Therefore, multiplying both sides of 2n ≡ 3 mod 7 by 4 gives:

n ≡ 3*4 mod 7
n ≡ 12 mod 7
12 divided by 7 is 1 with remainder 5, so 12 ≡ 5 mod 7. Therefore, n ≡ 5 mod 7.

So, the general solution for n is n = 7m + 5, where m is a non-negative integer.
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
210 divided by 7 is 30, so 210 is 7*30 + 0, which is a multiple of 7. Then 210 +3=213, which would be 7*30 + 3. Wait, but 2n=213 would mean n=106.5, which is not an integer. Wait, maybe I'm confused here.

Wait, no. The equation is 2n ≡3 mod7. So 2n=7k+3. So n=(7k+3)/2. So n must be an integer, so (7k+3) must be even. Therefore, 7k must be odd because 7k +3 is even. Since 7 is odd, k must be odd for 7k to be odd. So k must be odd integers.

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
But we need n > 100. So, we need to find the smallest m such that 7m + 5 > 100.

<prompt_2.1> Find the smallest integer m such that n = 7m + 5 is greater than 100. </prompt_2.1>
-----

Based on execution_1.2:
Let's check for n=105: 2n=210. Then 210=7*30 +0. But we need 2n=7k +3.

<prompt_2.2> Re-evaluate the solution for n=105 and n=112 to ensure they satisfy 2n ≡ 3 mod 7. </prompt_2.2>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Let's solve for m:

7m + 5 > 100
7m > 95
m > 95/7
95 divided by 7 is 13.571...., so m must be greater than 13.571. Since m must be an integer, the smallest m is 14.

Therefore, the smallest n is 7*14 + 5 = 98 + 5 = 103.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
So 210 is not congruent to 3 mod7. Wait, 210 mod7 is 0. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, if n=105, then 2n=210. But according to the problem, the number of pages is 3 more than a multiple of 7, so pages=7k+3. But 210 is 7*30, which is a multiple of 7, not 3 more. So something's wrong here.

Wait, but hold on. Let me check this again.

Wait, this contradicts the previous conclusion. So where did I go wrong?

<execution_3.1>
If m=14, n=7*14+5=98+5=103. Then 2n=206. Is 206 ≡3 mod7? Let's check. 206 divided by 7: 7*29=203, so 206-203=3. So yes, 206=7*29 +3. Therefore, 206 is 3 more than a multiple of 7. So that works. But wait, the problem says the number of leaves is greater than 100. So 103 is greater than 100, so that's okay. But is there a smaller number greater than 100 that satisfies this? Let's see. Because m=14 gives n=103, but maybe m=13 gives n=7*13 +5=91 +5=96, which is less than 100. So the next one is m=14, which is 103. So 103 is the answer.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
Let me retrace the steps.

The problem states: "the number of pages is 3 more than a multiple of 7". So pages = 7k + 3. But if n=105, then pages=210=7*30. So that's a multiple of 7, not 3 more. Therefore, n=105 is incorrect. So my earlier reasoning must have a mistake.

Wait, so where did I go wrong? Let's start over.

We have:

Number of pages = 2n = 7k + 3. So 2n ≡ 3 mod 7. Therefore, solving for n: n ≡ (3 mod 7) * inverse of 2 mod 7. The inverse of 2 mod 7 is 4, as before. So n ≡ 3*4 ≡ 12 ≡ 5 mod 7. So n ≡ 5 mod 7. Therefore, n=7m +5. Then, n>100, so 7m +5>100 =>7m>95 =>m>13.571, so m=14. Then n=7*14 +5=98+5=103. So n=103. Then pages=206. Let's check 206 mod7. 7*29=203. 206-203=3. So 206=7*29 +3. So yes, 206 is 3 more than a multiple of 7. Therefore, n=103 is the answer. Then why did I get confused with n=105?

Because when I first calculated m=14, n=7*14 +5=103, not 105. Wait, 7*14 is 98, 98+5=103. So n=103. Then n=103, which is greater than 100. Then n=103 is the answer. So why did I think of n=105 earlier? Because I miscalculated 7*14 +5 as 105, which is wrong. 7*14=98, 98+5=103. So n=103. Then the next ones would be 103, 110, 117, etc.

But let me check n=103. 2n=206. 206 divided by 7: 7*29=203. 206-203=3. So yes, 206=7*29 +3. So that works. So 103 is the answer. Then why did I initially think of 105? Because I miscalculated 7*14 +5 as 105, but it's actually 103. So the correct answer is 103.

But wait, let's check if there is a smaller n greater than 100. Let's see. The solutions are n=7m +5. So starting from m=14, n=103. Then m=15 gives 7*15 +5=110, which is 103+7=110. So 103 is the first one after 100. So 103 is the answer.

But let me verify with another approach. Let's find the smallest n>100 such that 2n ≡3 mod7. So 2n ≡3 mod7. Let's compute 2n mod7=3. So n≡(3/2) mod7. Since 2*4=8≡1 mod7, so 1/2≡4 mod7. Therefore, 3/2≡3*4=12≡5 mod7. So n≡5 mod7. Therefore, n=7k +5. Find the smallest k such that 7k +5>100. So 7k>95 =>k>13.571. So k=14. Then n=7*14 +5=98+5=103.

But wait, let's verify this. If n=103, then the number of pages is 206.

<prompt_4.1> Verify that n=103 satisfies the condition that the number of pages is 3 more than a multiple of 7. </prompt_4.1>

Based on execution_3.2:
Therefore, the answer is 103. But wait, let me check if 103 is indeed the minimal.

<prompt_4.2> Confirm that n=103 is the smallest number of leaves greater than 100 that satisfies the conditions. </prompt_4.2>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
Let's divide 206 by 7. 7*29=203, 206-203=3. So yes, 206=7*29 +3. Therefore, 206 is 3 more than a multiple of 7. So that satisfies the condition. And n=103 is greater than 100. But wait, is 103 the smallest such number greater than 100? Let's check if there's a smaller n between 100 and 103 that satisfies n≡5 mod7. Let's see. The numbers congruent to 5 mod7 after 100 would be 103, 110, 117, etc. Wait, but what about numbers between 100 and 103? Let's check 101. 101 divided by 7: 7*14=98, 101-98=3. So 101≡3 mod7. 102≡4 mod7. 103≡5 mod7. So yes, 103 is the first one after 100 that is ≡5 mod7.
</execution_4.1>

<execution_4.2>
Wait, 103 is greater than 100, and 2*103=206=7*29 +3. So that works. But let me check if there is a smaller n between 101 and 103 that is congruent to 5 mod7.

Let's see. 100 divided by 7: 7*14=98. 100-98=2. So 100≡2 mod7. Then 101≡3, 102≡4, 103≡5, 104≡6, 105≡0, 106≡1, 107≡2, etc. So the first n after 100 that is ≡5 mod7 is 103. So yes, 103 is the smallest n>100 in this congruence class. Therefore, 103 is the answer.

But wait, the problem says "the number of leaves is greater than 100". So 103 is the answer. But let me check again if I made any mistake in the congruence.

We had 2n ≡3 mod7. So solving for n: n≡3*4 mod7≡12 mod7≡5 mod7. Correct. So n=7k+5. The smallest n>100 is when 7k+5>100 =>7k>95 =>k>13.571. So k=14. Then n=7*14+5=98+5=103. So yes, 103. Therefore, the answer should be 103.

But wait, let me check if 103 is indeed a valid number of leaves. Since each leaf is a piece of paper, the number of leaves must be an integer, which it is. So 103 leaves would mean 206 pages. 206 divided by 7 is 29 with a remainder of 3, so 206=7*29 +3. So that's correct. Therefore, the answer is 103.

Based on execution_4.2:
Wait, but let me check once more. Suppose someone says, "Wait, what if n=105?

<execution_5.1>
Then pages=210=7*30. But 210 is 0 mod7, which is not 3. So that's invalid. Similarly, n=110: pages=220. 220 divided by7 is 31*7=217, remainder 3. So 220=31*7 +3. So 220 is 3 more than a multiple of7. So n=110 is another solution, but it's larger than 103. Similarly, n=117: pages=234. 234-217=17, which is not 3. Wait, 7*33=231, 234-231=3. So yes, 234=7*33 +3. So n=117 is also a solution. So the solutions are 103,110,117,124,... etc. So 103 is the smallest one above 100. So 103 is the answer.

<Execution_6>
<execution_6.1>
206 divided by7: 7*29=203, remainder 3. So 206=7*29 +3. Correct. So the remainder is 3. So that's exactly what the problem states. So 206 is 3 more than a multiple of7. So yes, 103 is correct. Therefore, the smallest number of leaves greater than 100 is 103.

Wait, but in my initial calculation, I thought m=14 gives n=103, but I mistakenly said 7*14=98 +5=103. So that's correct. So the answer is 103. Therefore, I think 103 is the correct answer. I must have confused myself earlier by miscalculating 7*14 +5 as 105, but 7*14 is 98, 98+5=103. So yes, 103 is correct. So the smallest number of leaves is 103.
