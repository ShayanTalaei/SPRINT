<Question>
Consider the function $z(x,y)$ describing the paraboloid
\[z = (2x - y)^2 - 2y^2 - 3y.\]Archimedes and Brahmagupta are playing a game.  Archimedes first chooses $x.$  Afterwards, Brahmagupta chooses $y.$  Archimedes wishes to minimize $z$ while Brahmagupta wishes to maximize $z.$  Assuming that Brahmagupta will play optimally, what value of $x$ should Archimedes choose?
</Question>

<think>
<Plan_1>
Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, we have this function z(x, y) = (2x - y)² - 2y² - 3y. Archimedes chooses x first, then Brahmagupta chooses y. Archimedes wants to minimize z, and Brahmagupta wants to maximize it. We need to find the value of x that Archimedes should pick to minimize z, assuming Brahmagupta plays optimally to maximize z. Hmm, this sounds like a minimax problem. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's understand the function z(x, y). It's a quadratic function in terms of x and y. Maybe if I can rewrite it in a way that separates x and y, it would be easier to analyze. Let's expand the squared term first.

<prompt_1.1> Expand the squared term in the function z(x, y) and simplify the expression. </prompt_1.1>

<execution_1.1>
(2x - y)² = 4x² - 4xy + y². So substituting back into z, we get:

z = 4x² - 4xy + y² - 2y² - 3y

Combine like terms:

4x² - 4xy + y² - 2y² - 3y = 4x² - 4xy - y² - 3y

So, z(x, y) = 4x² - 4xy - y² - 3y.

Based on execution_1.1:
Since Archimedes chooses x first, he will pick an x to minimize the maximum value that Brahmagupta can choose for y. So, essentially, Archimedes is trying to choose an x such that the worst-case (maximizing) y results in the smallest possible z.

To approach this, I think we need to first, for a given x, find the y that maximizes z(x, y). Then, express that maximum value as a function of x, and then find the x that minimizes this maximum value.

So, step 1: For a fixed x, find the y that maximizes z(x, y). Let's treat x as a constant and consider z as a function of y. Then, find the maximum of z with respect to y.

Looking at z(x, y) = 4x² - 4xy - y² - 3y.

But wait, let me check if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe by completing the square in terms of y for a given x. Let's try that.

<prompt_2.2> Complete the square for z(x, y) with respect to y and find the maximum value for a given x. </prompt_2.2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Let's write this as a quadratic in y:

z(y) = -y² - (4x + 3)y + 4x²

So, quadratic in y: z(y) = -y² - (4x + 3)y + 4x².

Since the coefficient of y² is -1, which is negative, the parabola opens downward, meaning the vertex is the maximum point. Therefore, the maximum with respect to y occurs at the vertex of the parabola.

The vertex of a quadratic ay² + by + c is at y = -b/(2a). Here, a = -1, b = -(4x + 3). Wait, let me check:

Wait, the quadratic is z(y) = -y² - (4x + 3)y + 4x². So in standard form, a = -1, b = -(4x + 3), c = 4x².

Therefore, the y-coordinate of the vertex (which gives the maximum) is at y = -b/(2a). Let's compute that:

y = - [ -(4x + 3) ] / (2 * -1) = (4x + 3)/(-2) = - (4x + 3)/2

So, for a given x, the y that maximizes z is y = - (4x + 3)/2.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Starting with z(x, y) = 4x² -4xy - y² -3y.

Let's rearrange terms:

z = -y² - (4x + 3)y + 4x².

This is a quadratic in y: z = -y² - (4x + 3)y + 4x².

Since the coefficient of y² is negative (-1), this quadratic opens downward, so it has a maximum. The maximum occurs at the vertex. The vertex of a quadratic ay² + by + c is at y = -b/(2a). Here, a = -1, b = -(4x + 3). So, y = - [-(4x + 3)]/(2*(-1)) = (4x + 3)/(-2) = - (4x + 3)/2.

So, the y that maximizes z for a given x is y = - (4x + 3)/2. Then, substituting this back into z gives the maximum z for that x. Then, we can write z as a function of x and find the x that minimizes it. This is exactly the same as before, so it confirms our previous result. Therefore, regardless of the approach, we end up with x = -1/4.

Now, let's substitute this y back into the expression for z to find the maximum z as a function of x.

Compute z(x, y) at y = - (4x + 3)/2:

First, let's compute each term:

Based on execution_2.2:
Alternatively, maybe we can think in terms of game theory. Since Archimedes wants to minimize the maximum z, Brahmagupta will choose the y that maximizes z for whatever x Archimedes picks. Therefore, Archimedes must choose x such that this maximum is as small as possible.

Alternatively, if we consider the value of the game, which is the minimum over x of the maximum z over y. So, the value is:

<prompt_3.2> Consider the game theory perspective and confirm the optimal x using the minimax theorem. </prompt_3.2>

<execution_3.1>
Term 1: 4x² (from 4x² - 4xy - y² - 3y). Wait, no. Wait, z(x, y) = 4x² - 4xy - y² - 3y. So, substituting y = - (4x + 3)/2 into z:

First, compute 4x²: that's just 4x².

Then, compute -4xy: -4x * [ - (4x + 3)/2 ] = -4x * (-4x -3)/2 = (4x)(4x + 3)/2 = [16x² + 12x]/2 = 8x² + 6x.

Next, compute -y²: - [ (- (4x + 3)/2 )² ] = - [ (4x + 3)² / 4 ] = - (16x² + 24x + 9)/4.

Then, compute -3y: -3 * [ - (4x + 3)/2 ] = (12x + 9)/2.

Now, sum all these terms:

4x² + 8x² + 6x - (16x² + 24x + 9)/4 + (12x + 9)/2.

Let me combine them step by step. First, combine 4x² + 8x² = 12x². Then, 6x remains. Then, the next term is - (16x² + 24x + 9)/4. Let's break that into separate terms: -16x²/4 -24x/4 -9/4 = -4x² -6x -2.25. Then, the last term is (12x + 9)/2 = 6x + 4.5.

So, putting all together:

12x² + 6x -4x² -6x -2.25 +6x +4.5.

Combine like terms:

12x² -4x² = 8x².

6x -6x +6x = 6x.

-2.25 +4.5 = 2.25.

So, total z at y = - (4x + 3)/2 is 8x² + 6x + 2.25.

Wait, 2.25 is 9/4, and 6x is 6x, 8x² is 8x². So, z_max(x) = 8x² + 6x + 9/4.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
min_{x} max_{y} [4x² -4xy - y² -3y]

Which, as we computed, leads to x = -1/4.

Alternatively, is there a way to visualize this? Let's think. The function z is quadratic in x and y. The x is chosen first, then y. So, for each x, we find the maximum over y, which gives a function of x, then minimize that.

Alternatively, could there be a saddle point or something? But since it's a zero-sum game between two players with opposite objectives, the minimax theorem applies, and under certain conditions (like convexity/concavity), the value is achieved at a certain point.

But perhaps we don't need to go into that. Our calculations so far seem consistent. Let me check once more.

Wait, another way to check: Suppose Archimedes picks x = -1/4. Then Brahmagupta picks y = - (4*(-1/4) + 3)/2 = - (-1 + 3)/2 = - (2)/2 = -1. Then z = (2*(-1/4) - (-1))² - 2*(-1)^2 -3*(-1) = (-0.5 +1)^2 - 2*1 +3 = (0.5)^2 -2 +3 = 0.25 +1 = 1.25.

If Archimedes picks a different x, say x = 0. Then y = -(0 +3)/2 = -1.5. Then z = (0 - (-1.5))² -2*(-1.5)^2 -3*(-1.5) = (1.5)^2 -2*(2.25) +4.5 = 2.25 -4.5 +4.5 = 2.25. Which is higher than 1.25.

If Archimedes picks x = -1, then y = - (4*(-1) +3)/2 = - (-4 +3)/2 = - (-1)/2 = 0.5. Then z = (2*(-1) -0.5)^2 -2*(0.5)^2 -3*(0.5) = (-2 -0.5)^2 -2*(0.25) -1.5 = (-2.5)^2 -0.5 -1.5 =6.25 -2=4.25. Which is even higher.

If Archimedes picks x = -1/4, the minimum, then z is 5/4. If he picks x higher than that, say x = 1, then y = -(4*1 +3)/2 = -7/2. Then z would be (2*1 - (-7/2))² -2*(-7/2)^2 -3*(-7/2) = (2 +3.5)^2 -2*(49/4) +21/2 =5.5² -49/2 +21/2 =30.25 -28/2=30.25 -14=16.25. Which is way higher.

Therefore, it seems that x = -1/4 is indeed the point where, if Archimedes picks this x, Brahmagupta's best response gives the minimal possible maximum z. So, this seems to be the correct answer.

So, now, Archimedes wants to choose x to minimize this expression: 8x² + 6x + 9/4.

So, now we have a quadratic in x. Let's denote this function as f(x) = 8x² + 6x + 9/4. To find the x that minimizes f(x), we can take the derivative and set it to zero, or use the vertex formula.

Since it's a quadratic with a positive coefficient on x², it opens upwards, so the minimum is at the vertex.

The x-coordinate of the vertex is at -b/(2a) where a = 8, b = 6. So:

x = -6/(2*8) = -6/16 = -3/8.

So, x = -3/8.

Wait, but let me verify this. Let's compute the derivative of f(x):

f'(x) = 16x + 6. Setting this equal to zero gives 16x + 6 = 0 => x = -6/16 = -3/8. Yes, that's correct.

So, Archimedes should choose x = -3/8? But wait, this contradicts my initial thought that x = -1/4. Wait, something's wrong here. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait a minute, maybe I made a mistake when substituting y back into z. Let me go back to the step where I computed z at y = - (4x + 3)/2. Let me recompute that to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error.

Compute each term:

First, 4x² is just 4x².

Second term: -4xy = -4x*(- (4x + 3)/2) = (4x*(4x + 3))/2 = (16x² + 12x)/2 = 8x² + 6x.

Third term: -y² = - [ (- (4x + 3)/2 )² ] = - [ (4x + 3)² / 4 ] = - (16x² + 24x + 9)/4.

Fourth term: -3y = -3*(- (4x + 3)/2) = (12x + 9)/2.

Now, sum all terms:

4x² + 8x² + 6x - (16x² + 24x + 9)/4 + (12x + 9)/2.

Combine the terms:

4x² + 8x² = 12x².

Then, 12x² - (16x² + 24x + 9)/4.

Let me compute 12x² as 48x²/4. So, 48x²/4 - (16x² + 24x + 9)/4 = (48x² -16x² -24x -9)/4 = (32x² -24x -9)/4.

Then, add the remaining terms: (12x + 9)/2 = (24x + 18)/4.

So total z is (32x² -24x -9)/4 + (24x + 18)/4 = [32x² -24x -9 +24x +18]/4 = [32x² +9]/4.

Wait, that simplifies to (32x² + 9)/4. Which is 8x² + 9/4. Wait, that's different from before. So earlier, I must have miscalculated. So, correct expression is 8x² + 9/4. So, f(x) = 8x² + 9/4.

Therefore, the maximum value that Brahmagupta can achieve is 8x² + 9/4. Then, Archimedes wants to choose x to minimize this expression. Since 8x² is a parabola opening upwards, the minimum occurs at x = 0. Plugging x = 0, we get 9/4.

<Execution_6>
<execution_6.1>
If f(x) = 8x² + 9/4, then the derivative is 16x, setting to zero gives x = 0. So, the minimum is at x = 0, and the minimal maximum z is 9/4.

But that's conflicting with the previous result where substituting y into z gave 8x² + 6x + 9/4. But that was incorrect. Let me retrace.

Wait, when I re-expressed z as 48x²/4 - (16x² +24x +9)/4 + (24x +18)/4, that becomes (48x² -16x² -24x -9 +24x +18)/4 = (32x² +9)/4. So, 32x²/4 is 8x², and 9/4 is 9/4. So, z = 8x² + 9/4. Therefore, that's correct. So, the maximum value Brahmagupta can force is 8x² + 9/4. Then, Archimedes wants to minimize this over x. Since 8x² is minimized at x=0, giving 9/4. Therefore, the optimal x is 0?

But this contradicts the previous calculation where substituting x=-3/8. So, which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in completing the square or in the vertex calculation.

Alternatively, let's approach this again. Let's redo the substitution step carefully.

Given y = - (4x +3)/2. Substitute into z(x,y):

z = 4x² -4xy - y² -3y.

Substitute y:

First, compute each term:

4x² is 4x².

-4xy = -4x*(- (4x +3)/2) = (4x*(4x +3))/2 = (16x² +12x)/2 =8x² +6x.

-y² = - [ (- (4x +3)/2 )² ] = - [ (4x +3)^2 /4 ] = - (16x² +24x +9)/4.

-3y = -3*(- (4x +3)/2) = (12x +9)/2.

Now, sum all terms:

4x² +8x² +6x - (16x² +24x +9)/4 + (12x +9)/2.

Combine like terms:

First, 4x² +8x² =12x².

Then, 12x² - (16x² +24x +9)/4. Let's express 12x² as 48x²/4. So, 48x²/4 -16x²/4 -24x/4 -9/4 = (32x² -24x -9)/4.

Then, add (12x +9)/2, which is (24x +18)/4.

So total z is (32x² -24x -9 +24x +18)/4 = (32x² +9)/4.

Therefore, z = (32x² +9)/4 =8x² + 9/4. So, that's correct. Therefore, the function to minimize is 8x² +9/4. The derivative is 16x, set to zero gives x=0. Therefore, x=0 is the optimal choice for Archimedes.

But wait, if x=0, then y = - (4*0 +3)/2 = -3/2. Then, z =8*(0)^2 +9/4=9/4=2.25.

But let's check with another x. Suppose x= -3/8, as previously thought.

<Execution_7>
<execution_7.1>
Then y = - (4*(-3/8) +3)/2 = - ( -12/8 +3 )/2 = - ( -3/2 +3 )/2 = - (3/2)/2 = -3/4.

Then z =8*(-3/8)^2 +9/4=8*(9/64) +9/4= (72/64) + (144/64)=216/64=27/8=3.375. Which is higher than 2.25. So, if Archimedes picks x=-3/8, then the maximum z is 27/8, which is 3.375, which is worse (higher) than if he picks x=0, which gives z=2.25. Therefore, x=0 is better for Archimedes. Therefore, my initial calculation where I thought the answer was x=-3/8 was wrong because I made a mistake in the substitution step. The correct maximum z is 8x² +9/4, which is minimized at x=0.

But wait, this seems conflicting with the previous result where after correcting the calculation, we found that the maximum z is 8x² +9/4. Therefore, the minimal maximum is at x=0. Therefore, Archimedes should choose x=0. But why did the vertex formula give x=-3/8 earlier? Because I incorrectly computed the maximum z. So, the correct answer is x=0.

But let's verify once more. Let's take x=0, then y=-3/2.

Compute z:

z=(2*0 - (-3/2))² -2*(-3/2)^2 -3*(-3/2).

Based on execution_7.1:
= (3/2)^2 -2*(9/4) +9/2

If x=0, then z=9/4. If x=-3/8, then z=27/8=3.375, which is higher. So, x=0 is better for Archimedes. Therefore, the correct answer is x=0.

Wait, but let's check another point. Suppose x=1, then y=-(4*1 +3)/2=-7/2.

<Execution_8>
<execution_8.1>
Then z=8*(1)^2 +9/4=8 +2.25=10.25. Which is higher than 9/4. So, yes, x=0 is indeed better. Therefore, the correct answer is x=0.

But wait, let's see. The problem is from an exam or a problem set? The way the problem is structured, with Archimedes choosing x first, then Brahmagupta choosing y, and we need to find the x that Archimedes picks to minimize the maximum z. The answer is x=0. But let me confirm once again.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the substitution step. Let's redo that substitution.

Given y = - (4x +3)/2. Let's compute z:

z =4x² -4x*y - y² -3y.

Compute each term:

4x² is 4x².

-4x*y = -4x*(- (4x +3)/2) = (4x*(4x +3))/2 = (16x² +12x)/2 =8x² +6x.

-y² = - [ (4x +3)^2 /4 ] = - [ (16x² +24x +9)/4 ] = -4x² -6x -9/4.

-3y = -3*(- (4x +3)/2) = (12x +9)/2 =6x +4.5.

Now, sum all terms:

4x² +8x² +6x -4x² -6x -9/4 +6x +4.5.

Combine like terms:

4x² +8x² -4x² =8x².

6x -6x +6x =6x.

-9/4 +4.5 = -2.25 +4.5=2.25.

Thus, z=8x² +6x +2.25. Then, to find the minimum over x of the maximum z, which is 8x² +6x +2.25. Then, the minimum of this quadratic is at x=-b/(2a)= -6/(16)= -3/8. But wait, this is conflicting with the previous result. Wait, but if we compute the maximum z for a given x, which is 8x² +6x +2.25, then to find the x that minimizes this expression, we take the derivative: d/dx [8x² +6x +2.25] =16x +6. Setting to zero gives x= -6/16= -3/8. Therefore, x= -3/8.

But this contradicts the previous result where after correctly computing the maximum z, we found it to be 8x² +9/4. Wait, how is this possible?

Wait, the confusion arises from different substitutions. Wait, in the first approach, after correctly substituting y into z, we obtained z=8x² +9/4. But in the second approach, we have z=8x² +6x +2.25. Which one is correct?

-9/4 +4.5= -2.25 +4.5=2.25.

Thus, z=8x² +6x +2.25. Therefore, this is correct. Therefore, the previous result where I obtained 8x² +9/4 was incorrect. The correct expression is 8x² +6x +2.25. Therefore, the function to minimize is 8x² +6x +2.25. Then, taking derivative:16x +6=0 =>x= -6/16= -3/8.

9/16 -54/16 -81/16 +108/16= (9 -54 -81 +108)/16= (9 -54= -45; -45 -81= -126; -126 +108= -18)/16= -18/16= -9/8. Wait, that can't be. Wait, z should be 8x² +6x +2.25. Let me compute that:

8*(9/64) +6*(-3/8) +2.25= (72/64) + (-18/8) +2.25= (9/8) - (9/4) +9/4=9/8=1.125.

But when substituting the actual values, I get -9/8. That's impossible. There must be a miscalculation here. Wait, let's recompute z when x=-3/8 and y=-9/4.

Based on execution_10.1:
First term:4x²=4*(9/64)=36/64=9/16.

Second term:-4xy= -4*(-3/8)*(-9/4)= -4*(27/32)= -27/8.

Third term:-y²= - (81/16).

Fourth term:-3y= -3*(-9/4)=27/4.

So total z=9/16 -27/8 -81/16 +27/4.

Convert all to 16 denominators:

9/16 -54/16 -81/16 +108/16.

Compute numerator:9 -54 -81 +108= (9 -54)= -45; (-45 -81)= -126; (-126 +108)= -18. So, -18/16= -9/8. Wait, that's negative. But z is supposed to be a quadratic form. How can z be negative? Let me check the original function.

z=(2x - y)^2 -2y^2 -3y.

If x=-3/8 and y=-9/4:

First term: (2*(-3/8) - (-9/4))² = (-6/8 +9/4)² = ( -3/4 +9/4 )² = (6/4)² = (3/2)²=9/4=2.25.

Second term: -2*(-9/4)^2= -2*(81/16)= -162/16= -81/8= -10.125.

Third term: -3*(-9/4)=27/4=6.75.

So total z=2.25 -10.125 +6.75= (2.25 +6.75)=9 -10.125= -1.125. Which is -9/8. So, z is negative here. But how? The original function is z=(2x - y)^2 -2y² -3y. So, depending on the values, z can be negative.
