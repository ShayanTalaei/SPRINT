<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to solve this inequality: -4 < 2(x - 1) < 8. And then express the solution in the form a < x < b, and find a + b. Alright, let me think step by step.

First, I remember that solving compound inequalities like this often involves breaking them into two separate inequalities, but maybe there's a way to handle them all at once. Let me recall. Since it's a triple inequality, I can try to manipulate it all in one go as long as I perform the same operation on all three parts. That should work here.

The inequality is -4 < 2(x - 1) < 8. The goal is to solve for x. To do that, I need to isolate x in the middle. Right now, the expression involving x is 2(x - 1). So maybe I can first divide all parts of the inequality by 2 to get rid of that coefficient.

Wait, but let me think again. Sometimes when dealing with inequalities, especially if you multiply or divide by a negative, you have to reverse the inequality signs. But in this case, we divided by 2, which is positive, so the inequality signs stay the same. So that step is correct. Let me just verify each step again.

Let me plug in a value for x to test. Let's take x = 2, which is inside the interval.

<prompt_1.3> Test the solution by plugging in values for x as per the above plan. </prompt_1.3>

Alternatively, maybe I can solve the compound inequality by splitting it into two separate inequalities. Let's try that approach to verify.

Alternatively, maybe someone might make a mistake by not reversing the inequality when multiplying or dividing by a negative, but in this case, we didn't have to. But if there was a negative coefficient, that's where errors can creep in. Also, sometimes people might forget to apply the operation to all parts of the inequality. For example, if someone divided only one part by 2 and not the others, that would be a mistake.

<prompt_1.5> Discuss potential mistakes in solving the inequality as per the above plan. </prompt_1.5>

Another point: when adding or subtracting, as long as you do it to all parts, it's fine. Similarly with multiplying/dividing. So as long as you follow that, you should be okay.
So, I think that's solid. Therefore, the answer is 6.

Let's try that.

Starting with -4 < 2(x - 1) < 8. If I divide all three parts by 2, what do I get?

Left part: -4 divided by 2 is -2.

Middle part: 2(x - 1) divided by 2 is just (x - 1).

Right part: 8 divided by 2 is 4.

So after dividing by 2, the inequality becomes: -2 < (x - 1) < 4.
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
Original inequality: -4 < 2(x - 1) < 8.

Step 1: Divide all three parts by 2. Since 2 is positive, inequality signs remain the same. So:

-4 / 2 < (2(x - 1)) / 2 < 8 / 2.

Calculates to: -2 < x - 1 < 4.

Step 2: Now, to solve for x, add 1 to all three parts. Adding 1 to the left part: -2 + 1 = -1. Middle part: x - 1 + 1 = x. Right part: 4 + 1 = 5. So, -1 < x < 5.
</execution_1.2>

<execution_1.3>
Then 2(x - 1) = 2(2 - 1) = 2(1) = 2. The original inequality for that part would be -4 < 2 < 8, which is true. Now, if x is 0, which is at the lower bound, 2(0 - 1) = 2(-1) = -2. Then the inequality becomes -4 < -2 < 8, which is also true. If x is 5, which is at the upper bound, 2(5 - 1) = 8. Then the inequality is -4 < 8 < 8. Wait, hold on. The original inequality is -4 < 2(x -1) < 8. So when x is 5, 2(x -1) equals 8. But the inequality is strict: less than 8, not less than or equal. So does that mean x cannot be 5? Hmm, but in the solution we have x < 6, not x ≤ 6. So that's correct. So when we divide by 2, we get -2 < x -1 <4, then add 1: -1 <x <5. Wait, no, wait. Wait, when we divided by 2, we had -2 < x -1 <4. Then adding 1 to all parts: -2 +1 = -1, and 4 +1 =5. So x is between -1 and 5. So x can be up to but not including 5. So when x approaches 5, 2(x -1) approaches 8, but doesn't reach it. So the original inequality is strict, so 8 is not included. Therefore, the solution is correct as -1 <x <5. So a is -1 and b is 5, so a +b is 4.
</execution_1.3>

<execution_1.4>
Original inequality: -4 < 2(x - 1) < 8.

First, let's split it into two parts:

1. -4 < 2(x - 1)
2. 2(x - 1) < 8

Solving the first inequality: -4 < 2(x - 1)

Divide both sides by 2: -2 < x - 1

Add 1 to both sides: -2 + 1 < x → -1 < x

Second inequality: 2(x - 1) < 8

Divide both sides by 2: x - 1 < 4

Add 1 to both sides: x < 5

Combine the two results: -1 < x < 5. So same result. Therefore, a is -1 and b is 5, so a + b is 4.
</execution_1.4>

<execution_1.5>
But in this case, all parts were divided by 2, so as long as you divide all three parts, you're good. Also, in this problem, the coefficient was positive 2, so no sign reversal needed.

</Execution_1>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Now I need to get x by itself. The expression is (x - 1). To isolate x, I can add 1 to all parts of the inequality. So adding 1 to each part:

<prompt_2.1> Add 1 to all parts of the inequality to isolate x as per the above plan. </prompt_2.1>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Left part: -2 + 1 = -3

Middle part: (x - 1) + 1 = x

Right part: 4 + 1 = 5

So after adding 1 to all parts, the inequality becomes: -3 < x < 5.
</execution_2.1>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Wait, but let me check. If I have -2 < x - 1 < 4, then adding 1 to each part gives -2 +1 < x < 4 +1, which is -1 < x < 5.
Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Let me correct that.

<prompt_3.1> Verify the previous step and confirm the solution as per the above plan. </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
Original inequality after dividing by 2: -2 < x - 1 < 4.

So, to solve for x, I need to add 1 to each part. So:

Left part: -2 + 1 = -1

Middle part: (x - 1) + 1 = x

Right part: 4 + 1 = 5

Therefore, the inequality becomes: -1 < x < 5. So that's the solution.
</execution_3.1>
</Execution_3>

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
So in the form a < x < b, a is -1 and b is 5. Therefore, a + b is -1 + 5, which equals 4.

Wait, let me verify this solution. Let's pick a number in the interval, say x = 2.

<prompt_4.1> Verify the solution by plugging in x = 2 and check boundary values as per the above plan. </prompt_4.1>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
Plugging into 2(x - 1): 2(2 - 1) = 2(1) = 2. Then the original inequality is -4 < 2 < 8, which is true. Now, let's check the boundary values. If x is -1, then 2(-1 -1) = 2(-2) = -4. The original inequality is -4 < -4 < 8. Wait, but -4 is not less than -4; it's equal. So x cannot be -1. Similarly, if x is 5, 2(5 -1) = 8. The inequality becomes -4 < 8 < 8. Again, 8 is not less than 8. So the endpoints are excluded, which matches our solution -1 < x < 5. Therefore, the solution is correct.

Hence, a is -1 and b is 5, so a + b is 4.

<Plan_5>
Based on execution_4.1:
Let me just go through the steps again to make sure I didn't skip anything.

<prompt_5.1> Review the entire solution process to ensure no steps were skipped as per the above plan. </prompt_5.1>
</Plan_5>

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
Original inequality: -4 < 2(x - 1) < 8.

Divide all parts by 2: -4/2 = -2, 8/2 = 4. So -2 < x - 1 < 4.

Add 1 to all parts: -2 +1 = -1, 4 +1 =5. So -1 < x <5.

Yes, that's correct. So the sum a + b is -1 +5=4.
</execution_5.1>
</Execution_5>

<Final_answer>
Therefore, the value of $a + b$ is $\boxed{4}$.
