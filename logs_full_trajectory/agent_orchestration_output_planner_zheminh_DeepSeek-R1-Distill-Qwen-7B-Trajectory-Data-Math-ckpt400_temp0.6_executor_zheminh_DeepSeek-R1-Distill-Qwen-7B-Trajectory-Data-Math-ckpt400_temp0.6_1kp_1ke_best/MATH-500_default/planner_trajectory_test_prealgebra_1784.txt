Okay, let's see. I need to add 313.9 and 12.6 together and express the result as a decimal. Hmm, adding decimals, right? Let me think about how to approach this. 

First, I remember that when adding decimals, it's important to line up the decimal points so that each place value is correctly aligned. That way, you add the tenths to tenths, hundredths to hundredths, and so on. Let me write them down vertically to visualize better.

<prompt_1.1> Write the numbers 313.9 and 12.6 vertically to align their decimal points and prepare for addition. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
So, 313.9 would be written as 313.9, and 12.6 would be written as 12.6. Let me stack them:

313.9
+ 12.6
--------
</execution_1.1>
</Execution_1>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Starting from the rightmost digit, which is the tenths place. 9 plus 6. Wait, 9 plus 6 is 15. So I write down 5 and carry over 1 to the next column (the ones place).

<prompt_2.1> Add the tenths place (9 and 6) and handle any carryover. </prompt_2.1>

Next, the ones place. 3 (from 313.9) plus 2 (from 12.6) plus the carried over 1. That's 3 + 2 + 1 = 6. So, the ones place is 6.

<prompt_2.2> Add the ones place (3 and 2) along with any carryover and determine the ones place of the result. </prompt_2.2>

Moving to the tens place. 1 (from 313.9) plus 1 (from 12.6). That's 1 + 1 = 2. So, the tens place is 2.

<prompt_2.3> Add the tens place (1 and 1) and determine the tens place of the result. </prompt_2.3>

Now the hundreds place. 3 (from 313.9) plus nothing (since 12.6 doesn't have a hundreds place) so it's just 3. So the hundreds place remains 3.
Putting it all together, the sum is 326.5.

Wait a second, let me check that again. 313.9 plus 12.6. Let me add them step by step to verify. 

Starting with 313.9, if I add 10, that would be 323.9. Then add 2.6 to that. 323.9 + 2.6. Let's break that down: 323.9 + 2 is 325.9, then add 0.6 to get 326.5. That matches my previous result.

Alternatively, maybe using another method. Let's convert them to fractions. 313.9 is the same as 3139/10, and 12.6 is 126/10. Adding them together: 3139/10 + 126/10 = (3139 + 126)/10. Let's compute 3139 + 126. 

3139 + 100 = 3239, then +26 = 3265. So 3265/10 = 326.5. Yep, same answer. 

Another way, maybe using money. If 313.9 is like 313 dollars and 90 cents, and 12.6 is 12 dollars and 60 cents. Adding them: 313 + 12 = 325 dollars, and 90 + 60 = 150 cents, which is 1 dollar and 50 cents. So total is 325 + 1 = 326 dollars and 50 cents, which is 326.50. So that's 326.5. 

So all these different methods give the same result.

Then, moving to the ones place. The next column over. Here, 3 and 2. Adding those gives 5. Plus the carried over 1 makes 6. So, that's 6.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Wait, hold on. Wait, no. Wait, the numbers are 313.9 and 12.6. Let me make sure I align the digits correctly. 

Wait, 313.9 is three hundred thirteen point nine, and 12.6 is twelve point six. So when writing them vertically:

313.9
+ 12.6
--------
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
Wait, hold on. Wait, 313.9 has 3 in the hundreds place, 1 in the tens, 3 in the ones, and 9 in the tenths. Then 12.6 has 1 in the tens, 2 in the ones, and 6 in the tenths. So when adding the tens place: 1 (from 313.9) + 1 (from 12.6) = 2. Then ones place: 3 + 2 = 5? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 313.9's ones digit is 3, and 12.6's ones digit is 2. So 3 + 2 = 5. Then the tenths place: 9 + 6 = 15, so carryover 1. Then tens: 1 + 1 + 1 (carryover) = 3? Wait, now I'm confused. Wait, let me redo this step by step.

Wait, maybe I messed up the place values. Let's write them out with proper columns:

Hundreds | Tens | Ones | Tenths
--- | --- | --- | ---
3 | 1 | 3 | 9
0 | 1 | 2 | 6

Wait, the second number, 12.6, is actually 0 hundreds, 1 ten, 2 ones, 6 tenths. So when adding:

Tenths: 9 + 6 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1.
Ones: 3 + 2 = 5. Plus the carried over 1 makes 6. So ones place is 6.
Tens: 1 + 1 = 2. No carryover here.
Hundreds: 3 + 0 = 3.
So the sum is 326.5.
</execution_2.3>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1, execution_2.2, execution_2.3:
Wait, but let me confirm once more. If I add 313.9 + 12.6, that's 313.9 + 10 is 323.9, then +2.6 is 326.5.
Yep, correct. 

So the final answer is 326.5. Expressed as a decimal, that's already a decimal, so no need for further conversion.

I think that's thorough. All methods confirm the same result. No mistakes detected in the process.

Therefore, the result of adding 313.9 to 12.6, expressed as a decimal, is $\boxed{326.5}$.
