Alright, so I need to find the largest x-value where the graphs of f(x) and g(x) intersect. That means I need to solve for x where f(x) = g(x). Let me start by writing down both functions and then subtracting them to see what equation I need to solve.

<prompt_1.1> Write down the functions f(x) and g(x) and subtract them to find the equation to solve for x. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
The functions are:

f(x) = e^{3x² - |⌊x⌋|!} + C(22 + 735235|⌊x⌋|, 2356) + φ(|⌊x⌋| + 1) + 72x⁴ + 3x³ - 6x² + 2x + 1

g(x) = e^{3x² - |⌊x⌋|!} + C(22 + 735235|⌊x⌋|, 2356) + φ(|⌊x⌋| + 1) + 72x⁴ + 4x³ - 11x² - 6x + 13

Subtracting g(x) from f(x), we get:

f(x) - g(x) = (3x³ - 6x² + 2x + 1) - (4x³ - 11x² - 6x + 13) = 0

Let me compute that:

3x³ - 6x² + 2x + 1 - 4x³ + 11x² + 6x - 13 = 0

Combine like terms:

(3x³ - 4x³) + (-6x² + 11x²) + (2x + 6x) + (1 - 13) = 0

(-x³) + (5x²) + (8x) + (-12) = 0

Multiply both sides by -1 to make the leading coefficient positive:

x³ - 5x² - 8x + 12 = 0
</execution_1.1>
</Execution_1>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
So now I need to solve the cubic equation: x³ - 5x² - 8x + 12 = 0. The solutions to this equation will be the x-values where f(x) and g(x) intersect. The problem asks for the largest such x-value.

To find the roots of a cubic equation, I can try to factor it. Let me look for rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are factors of the constant term (12) divided by factors of the leading coefficient (1).
So possible roots are ±1, ±2, ±3, ±4, ±6, ±12.

Let me test these one by one.

<prompt_2.1> Test the possible rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. </prompt_2.1>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
First, test x=1:

1³ -5(1)² -8(1) +12 = 1 -5 -8 +12 = (1 -5) + (-8 +12) = (-4) + (4) = 0. So x=1 is a root.

Based on execution_2.1:
Great, so (x - 1) is a factor. Now let's perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to factor out (x - 1) from the cubic.

Using synthetic division:

<prompt_3.1> Perform synthetic division to factor out (x - 1) from the cubic equation. </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
Coefficients of the cubic: 1 (x³), -5 (x²), -8 (x), 12 (constant).

Set up synthetic division with root 1:

1 | 1   -5    -8     12
    |      1    -4    -12
    --------------------
      1   -4    -12     0

So the cubic factors into (x - 1)(x² - 4x - 12).

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
Now, let's factor the quadratic: x² - 4x - 12.

<prompt_4.1> Factor the quadratic equation to find all roots. </prompt_4.1>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
Looking for two numbers that multiply to -12 and add to -4. Let's see:  -6 and +2. Because (-6) * 2 = -12 and -6 + 2 = -4. So the quadratic factors as (x - 6)(x + 2).

Therefore, the cubic equation factors completely as (x - 1)(x - 6)(x + 2) = 0, so the roots are x = 1, x = 6, and x = -2.
</execution_4.1>
</Execution_4>

<Plan_5>
Based on execution_4.1:
Therefore, the graphs intersect at x = -2, x = 1, and x = 6. The largest of these is x = 6.

But hold on! I need to verify if these roots are valid in the original functions.

<prompt_5.1> Verify the roots in the original functions, considering the floor function and the domains of the functions. </prompt_5.1>
</Plan_5>

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
Because the functions f(x) and g(x) contain the term |⌊x⌋|! which involves the floor function. The factorial is only defined for non-negative integers, so |⌊x⌋| must be a non-negative integer. However, factorial is also defined for 0, but for negative integers, it's undefined. Wait, but here it's |⌊x⌋|, so since the absolute value is taken, |⌊x⌋| is a non-negative integer (since floor(x) can be negative, zero, or positive, but absolute value makes it non-negative integer if x is real. Wait, but floor(x) can be any integer less than or equal to x. So |⌊x⌋| is a non-negative integer. Therefore, the factorial is defined as long as |⌊x⌋| is a non-negative integer, which it is. So for any real x, |⌊x⌋| is a non-negative integer, so the factorial is defined. So the functions are defined for all real x. Therefore, the roots x = -2, 1, 6 are all valid, as long as when x is in those intervals, the floor function is consistent.

Wait, but when we solve equations involving floor functions, we have to check that the solutions lie within the intervals where the floor function is constant. For example, if x is in [n, n+1), then ⌊x⌋ = n. So for each root, we need to confirm that the value of x is in an interval where ⌊x⌋ is an integer, and then check if the equation holds.

But since we already found the roots algebraically, and the functions are defined for all real x, then the roots are valid. However, maybe there's a mistake here. Let me think again.

Wait, when we subtract f(x) - g(x) and set it to zero, we get a cubic equation. The roots of that equation are x = -2, 1, 6. So these are the x-values where f(x) = g(x). Since the functions are defined for all real x, these roots are valid. Therefore, the largest x-value is 6.

<Plan_6>
Based on execution_5.1:
But let me check if x=6 is actually a solution.

<prompt_6.1> Verify that x=6 is a valid solution by checking the floor function and the equation. </prompt_6.1>

Similarly, check x=1.

<prompt_6.2> Verify that x=1 is a valid solution by checking the floor function and the equation. </prompt_6.2>

Check x=-2.

<prompt_6.3> Verify that x=-2 is a valid solution by checking the floor function and the equation. </prompt_6.3>
</Plan_6>

<Execution_6>
<execution_6.1>
For x=6, ⌊6⌋ = 6, so |6|! = 720. The binomial coefficient is C(22 + 735235*6, 2356). That's a huge number, but since both f(x) and g(x) have the same binomial coefficient and φ(|⌊x⌋| +1) term, those terms cancel out when subtracting. Similarly, the exponential terms also have the same base, so they cancel out. Then the remaining terms after subtraction give the cubic equation. So as long as the algebra is correct, x=6 is a solution. Let me verify the subtraction again:

f(x) - g(x) = (3x³ -6x² +2x +1) - (4x³ -11x² -6x +13) = 3x³ -6x² +2x +1 -4x³ +11x² +6x -13 = (-x³) +5x² +8x -12. Then setting to zero gives -x³ +5x² +8x -12 = 0, which is equivalent to x³ -5x² -8x +12 = 0. Factoring gives (x -1)(x -6)(x +2) = 0, so roots at 1,6,-2. So yes, x=6 is a root. Then, since the functions are defined at x=6, and the floor function there is 6, which is an integer, so all terms are well-defined. Therefore, x=6 is indeed a valid intersection point.
</execution_6.1>

<execution_6.2>
For x=1, which is in [1,2), so ⌊1⌋ = 1. Let's verify if substituting x=1 into the cubic equation gives 0. We already did that earlier, but let's confirm again. Plugging x=1 into x³ -5x² -8x +12: 1 -5 -8 +12 = 0. So yes, correct.

Similarly, x=6 is in [6,7), so ⌊6⌋ =6. Let's check if x=6 is a solution. Plugging into the cubic equation: 6³ -5*(6)^2 -8*6 +12 = 216 - 180 -48 +12 = (216 -180) + (-48 +12) = 36 -36 = 0. So yes, correct.

Similarly, x=-2 is in [-2, -1), so ⌊-2⌋ = -2. Let's check if x=-2 is a solution. Plugging into the equation: (-2)^3 -5*(-2)^2 -8*(-2) +12 = -8 -20 +16 +12 = (-8 -20) + (16 +12) = -28 +28 = 0. Correct.

Therefore, all three roots are valid. Therefore, the largest x-value is 6.
</execution_6.2>

<execution_6.3>
Let's check x=6. When x=6, ⌊6⌋=6. So |⌊6⌋|=6. Then, in the functions f(x) and g(x), the terms are e^{3x² - |⌊x⌋|!}, binomial coefficient C(22 +735235*6, 2356), φ(6 +1)=φ(7). These are all defined. Then the polynomial terms 72x⁴ + 3x³ -6x² +2x +1. All terms are defined. So x=6 is a valid solution.

Similarly, x=1: ⌊1⌋=1, so |1|=1. All terms are defined. x=-2: ⌊-2⌋=-2, |⌊-2⌋|=2. So factorial 2! is 2. All terms are defined. So yes, all three roots are valid.

Therefore, the largest x-value is x=6.

<Plan_7>
Based on execution_6.1, execution_6.2, execution_6.3:
Wait, but let me check if there are any other possible roots that I might have missed. But the cubic equation only has three roots: -2,1,6. So since we have found all of them, and they are all valid, then yes, 6 is the largest.

But just to be thorough, let me consider if there could be any other solutions where the equation f(x)=g(x) holds, but not captured by the cubic equation. Let me check the subtraction again.

<prompt_7.1> Perform a final verification and conclude the largest x-value. </prompt_7.1>

<Execution_7>
<execution_7.1>
f(x) - g(x) = [e^{...} + C + φ + 72x⁴ +3x³ -6x² +2x +1] - [e^{...} + C + φ + 72x⁴ +4x³ -11x² -6x +13]

So the e^{...} terms cancel. The binomial coefficients C(22 +735235|⌊x⌋|, 2356) are the same in both f and g, so they cancel. The φ(|⌊x⌋| +1) terms are the same, so they cancel. Then 72x⁴ cancels. Then we have 3x³ -6x² +2x +1 minus (4x³ -11x² -6x +13). That gives -x³ +5x² +8x -12, which is correct. So the equation reduces to -x³ +5x² +8x -12 =0, which is equivalent to x³ -5x² -8x +12=0. So that's correct. Therefore, all solutions must satisfy this cubic equation. Therefore, the only solutions are x=-2,1,6. Hence, the largest is 6.

Therefore, the answer is 6.
