Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, we have three types of units here: treeks, squigs, and goolees. The problem gives us some relationships between their weights, and we need to find out how many treeks equal the weight of one squig. Hmm, okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, let me write down the given equations to have a clear picture.
The first statement says, "Ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee." So, translating that into an equation, if I let T represent the weight of a treek, S represent a squig, and G represent a goolee, then:
10T = 3S + G.

Got that.

The second statement is, "Two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig." So, that would be:
2T + G = S.

Right? Because two treeks plus one goolee equal one squig.

And the question is asking, "The combined weight of how many treeks equals the weight of one squig"? So, essentially, we need to find the number x such that xT = S. So, x would be S divided by T, or S/T. But since we have to express it as how many treeks, we need to find x in terms of the given equations.

So, the plan is to solve these two equations to express S in terms of T, or T in terms of S, and then find the ratio.

Let's see. We have two equations:

1) 10T = 3S + G

2) 2T + G = S

Maybe we can substitute G from the second equation into the first one. Let's try that.

From equation 2, we can express G as S - 2T. So, G = S - 2T. Then substitute this into equation 1.

So, substituting G in equation 1:

10T = 3S + (S - 2T)

Simplify the right side: 3S + S - 2T = 4S - 2T

So, equation becomes:

10T = 4S - 2T

Let's bring all the T terms to the left and S terms to the right:

10T + 2T = 4S

12T = 4S

Divide both sides by 4:

3T = S

So, S = 3T. Therefore, one squig equals the weight of three treeks. So, the combined weight of three treeks equals the weight of one squig.

Based on execution_1.1:

Wait, let me check with the second equation to make sure there's no mistake. If S = 3T, then from equation 2: 2T + G = S = 3T.

<prompt_2.1> Re-evaluate the solution using the second equation to ensure consistency. </prompt_2.1>

Let me just check again.

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
So, G = 3T - 2T = T. So, G = T. So, a goolee is equal in weight to a treek.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
First equation: 10T = 3S + G. If S=3T, then 3S = 9T. G = S - 2T = 3T - 2T = T. So, 3S + G = 9T + T = 10T. Correct.

Second equation: 2T + G = 2T + T = 3T = S. Correct.

So, everything checks out.

<Final_answer>
Therefore, the combined weight of $\boxed{3}$ treeks equals the weight of one squig.
