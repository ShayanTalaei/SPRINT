Okay, so I need to figure out what fraction of 2 feet is 3 inches. Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem. The question is asking, if I have 3 inches, how much of 2 feet is that? So essentially, I need to express 3 inches as a fraction of 2 feet. But wait, feet and inches are different units, so the first thing I should do is convert them to the same unit. That makes sense because you can't compare or calculate fractions with different units.

Let me recall the conversion between feet and inches. I know that 1 foot equals 12 inches. So, 2 feet would be 2 times 12 inches, which is 24 inches. Right? Let me check that again.
1 foot = 12 inches, so 2 feet = 2 * 12 = 24 inches. Yep, that's correct.

So now, the problem is asking what fraction 3 inches is of 24 inches. Because 2 feet is 24 inches. Therefore, the fraction would be 3 divided by 24. Let me write that down: 3/24.

But fractions can often be simplified, so I should reduce this to the simplest form. To do that, I need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 3 and 24. The factors of 3 are 1 and 3. The factors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. The common factors here are 1 and 3. The greatest one is 3. So if I divide both numerator and denominator by 3, I get 1/8. Let me confirm: 3 รท 3 = 1, and 24 รท 3 = 8. So yes, 3/24 simplifies to 1/8.

Wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Let's go through the steps again.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. If 1 inch is what fraction of 2 feet, then since 2 feet is 24 inches, 1 inch is 1/24 of 2 feet. Therefore, 3 inches would be 3*(1/24) = 3/24 = 1/8.
That's another way to look at it, and it gives the same result.

Let me just verify with an example. Suppose I have 24 inches, which is 2 feet. If I take 3 inches, then 3 divided by 24 is 0.125.

<prompt_1.2> Verify the solution by converting the fraction back to a decimal and checking logical consistency. </prompt_1.2>

Is there any other way this could be approached? Maybe by converting inches to feet directly. Let's see. 3 inches to feet.

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
First, convert 2 feet to inches. 2 feet * 12 inches/foot = 24 inches. Then, 3 inches divided by 24 inches. That gives 3/24. Simplify that by dividing numerator and denominator by 3, resulting in 1/8.
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
Which is 1/8 as a fraction. That makes sense. Because 0.125 is equivalent to 1/8. So that checks out. So 3 inches is 1/8 of 2 feet.
</execution_1.2>

<execution_1.3>
Since 1 inch is 1/12 of a foot. So 3 inches would be 3*(1/12) = 3/12 = 1/4 feet. So 1/4 feet divided by 2 feet is (1/4)/2 = 1/8. Again, the same result. So that's three different ways: converting both to inches, converting both to feet, and direct conversion. All lead to 1/8. So that seems solid.

Based on execution_1.2, execution_1.3:
I don't think I made any mistakes here.
The key was converting the units to the same measure before comparing them, then simplifying the fraction.
