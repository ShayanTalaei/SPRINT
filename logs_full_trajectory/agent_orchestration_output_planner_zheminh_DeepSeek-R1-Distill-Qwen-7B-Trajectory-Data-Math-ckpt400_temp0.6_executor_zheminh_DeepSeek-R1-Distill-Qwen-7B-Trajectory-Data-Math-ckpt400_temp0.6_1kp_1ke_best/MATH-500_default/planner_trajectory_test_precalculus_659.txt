Okay, so I need to find the equation of the plane that contains three points: (0, -1, -1), (-4, 4, 4), and (4, 5, 1). Hmm, let me remember how to approach this. I think the standard method is to find two vectors that lie on the plane, compute their cross product to get the normal vector, and then use the normal vector to write the plane equation. Let me try to work through this step by step.

First, let me label the points to make things easier. Let’s call them P1(0, -1, -1), P2(-4, 4, 4), and P3(4, 5, 1). 

Now, I need two vectors that are on the plane. I can get these by subtracting the coordinates of the points.
Let me compute vector v1 from P1 to P2 and vector v2 from P1 to P3.

<prompt_1.1> Calculate vectors v1 and v2 by subtracting the coordinates of P1 from P2 and P3 respectively. </prompt_1.1>

But let me verify this by plugging in the three points into the equation to make sure.

For point P1(0, -1, -1):

<prompt_1.2> Verify the plane equation by plugging in the coordinates of P1, P2, and P3. </prompt_1.2>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
So, vector v1 = P2 - P1 = (-4 - 0, 4 - (-1), 4 - (-1)) = (-4, 5, 5). 

Similarly, vector v2 = P3 - P1 = (4 - 0, 5 - (-1), 1 - (-1)) = (4, 6, 2).
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
Left-hand side: 2*0 + 3*(-1) + (-1)*(-1) + 0 = 0 -3 +1 +0 = -2. Correct.

For point P2(-4,4,4):

Left-hand side: 2*(-4) + 3*4 + (-1)*4 + 0 = -8 +12 -4 +0 = 0. Correct.

For point P3(4,5,1):

Left-hand side: 2*4 + 3*5 + (-1)*1 + 0 = 8 +15 -1 +0 = 22. Correct.

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Next, I need to find the normal vector to the plane. The cross product of v1 and v2 will give me a vector that's perpendicular to both, which is the normal vector. The cross product formula is:

<prompt_2.1> Calculate the normal vector using the cross product of vectors v1 and v2. </prompt_2.1>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
If vectors are (a1, a2, a3) and (b1, b2, b3), their cross product is:

(a2*b3 - a3*b2, a3*b1 - a1*b3, a1*b2 - a2*b1)

So applying this to v1 = (-4, 5, 5) and v2 = (4, 6, 2):

First component: 5*2 - 5*6 = 10 - 30 = -20

Second component: 5*4 - (-4)*2 = 20 - (-8) = 28

Wait, hold on. The cross product formula is (a2*b3 - a3*b2, a3*b1 - a1*b3, a1*b2 - a2*b1). Let me compute each component step by step to avoid mistakes.

First component (i-direction): a2*b3 - a3*b2 = 5*2 - 5*6 = 10 - 30 = -20

Second component (j-direction): a3*b1 - a1*b3 = 5*4 - (-4)*2 = 20 - (-8) = 28

Third component (k-direction): a1*b2 - a2*b1 = (-4)*6 - 5*4 = -24 - 20 = -44

So the normal vector n is (-20, 28, -44).
</execution_2.1>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
But the problem specifies that A should be positive. Right now, the normal vector has A as -20, which is negative. So I need to multiply the entire equation by -1 to make A positive.

<prompt_3.1> Adjust the normal vector so that the coefficient of x (A) is positive. </prompt_3.1>

Now, we can write the plane equation as 20x -28y +44z + D = 0. We need to find D. To find D, we can plug in one of the points that lies on the plane. Let's use point P1(0, -1, -1).

<prompt_3.2> Solve for D by plugging in the coordinates of P1 into the plane equation. </prompt_3.2>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
So, the normal vector becomes (20, -28, 44).

Wait, but if I reverse the order of the cross product, wouldn't that just reverse the direction of the normal vector? Let me confirm. If I compute v2 cross v1 instead of v1 cross v2, the cross product would be negative of v1 cross v2. So since I initially took v1 cross v2, which gave (-20, 28, -44), then v2 cross v1 would be (20, -28, 44). But since the normal vector just needs to be perpendicular, the direction (sign) doesn't matter for the plane equation, except that we need A positive. So by taking the negative of the cross product, we can get the normal vector with positive A.

So, the normal vector is (20, -28, 44).
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
Plugging into 20x -28y +44z + D = 0:

20*0 -28*(-1) +44*(-1) + D = 0

Calculates to: 0 +28 -44 + D = 0 => -16 + D = 0 => D = 16

So the equation is 20x -28y +44z +16 = 0.

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.2:
But wait, the problem also says that the coefficients A, B, C, D should be integers with gcd 1, and A > 0. So we need to check if the coefficients have a common divisor greater than 1.

<prompt_4.1> Check if the coefficients of the plane equation have a common divisor and simplify if necessary. </prompt_4.1>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
Let's check the gcd of 20, 28, 44, and 16.

Prime factors:

20: 2^2 *5

28: 2^2 *7

44: 2^2 *11

16: 2^4

So the common prime factor is 2^2 =4. Let's check if 4 divides all coefficients:

20 ÷4=5, 28 ÷4=7, 44 ÷4=11, 16 ÷4=4. So yes, gcd is 4. Therefore, we can divide the entire equation by 4 to simplify.

Dividing each term by 4: 5x -7y +11z +4 =0.

Now, check if gcd of 5,7,11,4 is 1. 5 and 7 are coprime, 11 is prime, and 4 is 2^2. There are no common factors among all four coefficients. So the gcd is 1. Therefore, the equation is simplified correctly.

<Plan_5>
Based on execution_4.1:
But let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors.

First, vectors v1 and v2:

<prompt_5.1> Verify the calculations for vectors, normal vector, and the plane equation. </prompt_5.1>
</Plan_5>

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
From P1(0,-1,-1) to P2(-4,4,4): subtracting P1 from P2 gives (-4 -0, 4 - (-1), 4 - (-1)) = (-4,5,5). Correct.

From P1 to P3: (4 -0,5 - (-1),1 - (-1)) = (4,6,2). Correct.

Cross product:

i component: 5*2 -5*6 =10 -30 =-20

j component: 5*4 - (-4)*2 =20 - (-8)=28 (but cross product formula for j component is a3*b1 -a1*b3, which here is 5*4 - (-4)*2=20 +8=28. Since the cross product formula has the j component as negative, so the cross product's j component is -28? Wait, hold on. Wait, cross product is:

If vectors are v1 = (a1, a2, a3) and v2 = (b1, b2, b3), then cross product is:

( a2*b3 - a3*b2,

a3*b1 - a1*b3,

a1*b2 - a2*b1 )

So the components are:

First component (i): a2*b3 - a3*b2

Second component (j): a3*b1 - a1*b3

Third component (k): a1*b2 - a2*b1

So plugging in:

First component: 5*2 -5*6=10 -30=-20

Second component:5*4 - (-4)*2=20 +8=28

Third component: (-4)*6 -5*4= -24 -20=-44

So cross product is (-20,28,-44). Then, since we want A positive, we take the negative of this vector, getting (20,-28,44). Correct.

Then plugging in P1(0,-1,-1):

20*0 -28*(-1) +44*(-1) + D =0 =>0 +28 -44 +D=0 => D=16. Correct.

Then equation is 20x -28y +44z +16=0. Then divide by 4: 5x -7y +11z +4=0. Check gcd(5,7,11,4). Since 5,7,11 are primes and 4 is 2^2. There are no common divisors. So yes, gcd is 1. Correct.

Therefore, the final equation is 5x -7y +11z +4=0.

Based on execution_5.1:
Let me just cross-verify by plugging in another point. Let's take P2(-4,4,4):

<prompt_6.1> Cross-verify the plane equation by plugging in the point P2. </prompt_6.1>
</Plan_6>

<Execution_6>
<execution_6.1>
5*(-4) -7*4 +11*4 +4 = -20 -28 +44 +4 = (-20 -28) + (44 +4) = -48 +48 =0. Correct.

Similarly, P3(4,5,1):

5*4 -7*5 +11*1 +4 =20 -35 +11 +4 = (20 +11 +4) -35 =35 -35=0. Correct.
</execution_6.1>
</Execution_6>

<Final_answer>
Therefore, the equation of the plane is $\boxed{5x - 7y + 11z + 4 = 0}$.
