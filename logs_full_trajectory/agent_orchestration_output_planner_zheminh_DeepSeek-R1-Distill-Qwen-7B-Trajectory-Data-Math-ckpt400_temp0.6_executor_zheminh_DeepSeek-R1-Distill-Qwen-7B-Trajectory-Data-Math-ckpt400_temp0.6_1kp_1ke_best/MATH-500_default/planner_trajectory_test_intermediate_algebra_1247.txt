<Plan_1>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is about a cubic equation with three distinct positive roots. The equation is given as 8x³ + 4a x² + 2b x + a = 0. We need to find the value of 'a' given that the sum of the base-2 logarithms of the roots is 5. Hmm, alright. Let me start by recalling some properties of polynomial equations and their roots.

First, for a cubic equation of the form px³ + qx² + rx + s = 0, the sum of the roots is -q/p, the sum of the product of the roots taken two at a time is r/p, and the product of the roots is -s/p. These are known as Vieta's formulas. Since the given equation is 8x³ + 4a x² + 2b x + a = 0, let's write down the Vieta's formulas for this specific equation.

Let me denote the roots by α, β, and γ. Then according to Vieta's:

Sum of roots: α + β + γ = - (4a)/8 = -a/2.

Sum of products: αβ + αγ + βγ = (2b)/8 = b/4.

Product of roots: αβγ = -a/8.

But wait, the problem states that all three roots are distinct and positive. So, α, β, γ are all positive real numbers.
That means their sum, sum of products, and product are all positive. However, according to Vieta's formulas, the sum of roots is -a/2. Since the sum is positive (as all roots are positive), then -a/2 must be positive.
Therefore, -a/2 > 0 implies that a < 0. Similarly, the product of roots is -a/8. Since the product is positive (all roots positive), then -a/8 > 0, which again gives a < 0. So that's consistent.

The problem also mentions that the sum of the base-2 logarithms of the roots is 5. So, log₂α + log₂β + log₂γ = 5. Using logarithm properties, this can be rewritten as log₂(αβγ) = 5.
Therefore, αβγ = 2⁵ = 32.

From Vieta's formulas, we have αβγ = -a/8. So, setting this equal to 32:

<prompt_1.1> Use the sum of logarithms to find the product of the roots and solve for \( a \) using Vieta's formula. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
-a/8 = 32  
Multiply both sides by -8:  
a = -32 * 8 = -256. 

Wait, that seems straightforward. But hold on, let me verify if this is correct. Because sometimes, in problems involving multiple conditions, there might be constraints that need to be checked. For example, even though we derived a = -256 based on the logarithm condition, we need to ensure that with this value of a, the original cubic equation indeed has three distinct positive roots.
</execution_1.1>
</Execution_1>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
First, let's confirm the value of a. If a = -256, then the product of the roots αβγ = -a/8 = 256/8 = 32, which matches the given condition that log₂(αβγ) = 5, since log₂(32) = 5. So that part checks out.
Now, we need to check if the equation 8x³ + 4*(-256)x² + 2b x + (-256) = 0 has three distinct positive roots. Let's write that equation out:

<prompt_2.1> Substitute \( a = -256 \) into the cubic equation and verify the conditions for three distinct positive roots. </prompt_2.1>
-----

But we need to check if such a and b exist such that the equation has three distinct positive roots.
Wait, but we already have a determined as -256. Then, we can compute b from Vieta's formula. Let's recall that from Vieta's, the sum of the roots is -a/2 = -(-256)/2 = 128. So α + β + γ = 128.

The sum of the products is b/4. So, αβ + αγ + βγ = b/4. Therefore, b = 4(αβ + αγ + βγ). 

But we also know that αβγ = 32. So, if we can find real numbers α, β, γ > 0, distinct, such that their sum is 128, their product is 32, and their sum of products is some value, then such a cubic equation exists.
However, is that possible? Let's think.

The problem is that if the sum of the roots is 128, and their product is 32, but all roots are positive. However, the arithmetic mean of the roots is 128/3 ≈ 42.666, while the geometric mean is (32)^(1/3) ≈ 3.1748. Since the arithmetic mean is much larger than the geometric mean, this suggests that the roots are highly skewed; most of them are much larger than the geometric mean. However, it's still possible for positive numbers to have such a relationship between their arithmetic and geometric means.

But let's check if such roots can exist. Let me consider if there's a contradiction here.

Suppose all three roots are equal.

<prompt_2.2> Check for contradictions in the existence of roots with given sums and products. </prompt_2.2>
-----

But we need to ensure that such a cubic equation with a = -256 and some b exists, with three distinct positive roots. 

But how can we verify that? Maybe by considering the discriminant of the cubic equation. For a cubic equation to have three distinct real roots, its discriminant must be positive. The discriminant D of a cubic equation ax³ + bx² + cx + d = 0 is given by:

D = 18abcd - 4b³d + b²c² - 4ac³ - 27a²d².

Wait, in our case, the cubic equation is 8x³ + 4a x² + 2b x + a = 0. Let's substitute a = -256:

<prompt_2.3> Calculate the discriminant of the cubic equation to verify the existence of three distinct positive roots. </prompt_2.3>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
8x³ - 4*256 x² + 2b x - 256 = 0  
Simplify: 8x³ - 1024x² + 2b x - 256 = 0.

To analyze the roots, perhaps we can use calculus. If the cubic has three distinct positive roots, then its graph must cross the x-axis three times in the positive region. For that, the cubic must have a local maximum and a local minimum, and the values of the function at these extrema must be of opposite signs (so that the graph crosses the x-axis three times). 

First, let's find the derivative of the cubic to find the critical points. The derivative is:

f'(x) = 24x² - 2048x + 2b.

Setting this equal to zero to find critical points:

24x² - 2048x + 2b = 0.  
Divide both sides by 2:  
12x² - 1024x + b = 0.

For the cubic to have two critical points (a local maximum and a local minimum), the quadratic equation 12x² - 1024x + b = 0 must have two distinct real roots. Therefore, the discriminant of this quadratic must be positive.

Discriminant D = ( -1024 )² - 4*12*b = 1048576 - 48b. 

For D > 0:  
1048576 - 48b > 0  
=> 48b < 1048576  
=> b < 1048576 / 48 ≈ 21845.333... 

So, as long as b is less than approximately 21845.333, the cubic will have two critical points. However, since we need three distinct positive roots, not only do we need two critical points, but the function values at these critical points must straddle the x-axis. That is, one local maximum above the x-axis and one local minimum below the x-axis (or vice versa), ensuring three crossings. 

But calculating this would require knowing the exact values of the critical points and the function values there, which depends on 'b'. However, since the problem states that there are three distinct positive roots, we can assume that such a 'b' exists. Therefore, perhaps the value of 'a' is indeed -256, and the problem is designed such that this is the answer, with the necessary 'b' existing.

<execution_2.2>
Then, each root would be 128/3 ≈ 42.666, and the product would be (128/3)^3 ≈ 8658. Which is way larger than 32. So, if the roots are equal, the product is much larger. However, if the roots are not equal, maybe some are larger and some are smaller. But the product is fixed at 32. Let's see if such roots can exist.

Suppose two roots are very large, and one is very small. For example, let’s say α and β are large, and γ is small. Then, α + β + γ = 128, αβ + αγ + βγ = S, and αβγ = 32. Let's try to see if such numbers can exist.

Let’s denote γ = 32/(αβ). Then, substituting into the sum: α + β + 32/(αβ) = 128. Let’s set t = αβ. Then, α + β = 128 - 32/t. Also, we know that for positive α and β, by AM ≥ GM, (α + β)/2 ≥ sqrt(αβ). So, (128 - 32/t)/2 ≥ sqrt(t). Let's write that:

(128 - 32/t)/2 ≥ sqrt(t)  
64 - 16/t ≥ sqrt(t)

This inequality must hold for some t > 0. Let's try to find t such that this is true. Let's pick t = 16. Then:

Left side: 64 - 16/16 = 64 - 1 = 63  
Right side: sqrt(16) = 4  
63 ≥ 4, which is true. So, possible. Then, α + β = 128 - 32/16 = 128 - 2 = 126. And αβ = 16. So, solving α + β = 126, αβ = 16. The quadratic equation would be x² -126x +16=0. The discriminant is 126² - 64 = 15876 -64=15812>0, so real roots. Therefore, α and β are real and positive. Therefore, such roots exist. For example, α ≈ (126 + sqrt(15812))/2 and β ≈ (126 - sqrt(15812))/2, both positive. Then, γ =32/(αβ)=32/16=2. So, γ=2. Therefore, the roots would be approximately 126.000... something, 0.126... something, and 2. All positive, distinct? Yes, since α and β are different (since discriminant is positive), and γ=2, which is different from α and β. Therefore, three distinct positive roots.

<execution_2.3>
So the equation becomes:

8x³ + 4*(-256)x² + 2b x + (-256) = 0

Simplify:

8x³ - 1024x² + 2b x - 256 = 0.

So, here, the coefficients are:

Leading coefficient (for x³): 8

x² coefficient: -1024

x coefficient: 2b

constant term: -256

So, to compute the discriminant D, let's use the formula for the discriminant of a cubic equation:

D = 18*(8)*(-1024)*(2b)*(-256) - 4*(-1024)^3*(-256) + (-1024)^2*(2b)^2 - 4*(8)*(2b)^3 - 27*(8)^2*(-256)^2

Wow, that's a lot. Let's compute each term step by step.

First, let's note that D must be positive for three distinct real roots. However, calculating this discriminant with the given coefficients might be quite tedious. Maybe there's another approach. Alternatively, perhaps using calculus: if the cubic has three distinct positive roots, then its graph must cross the x-axis three times in the positive region. Therefore, the function must have a local maximum above the x-axis and a local minimum below the x-axis (or vice versa), ensuring three real roots. Let's analyze the function f(x) = 8x³ -1024x² + 2b x -256.

Compute its derivative:

f'(x) = 24x² - 2048x + 2b.

For the function to have two critical points (a local maximum and a local minimum), the derivative must have two real roots. Therefore, the discriminant of f'(x) must be positive.

Discriminant of f'(x): ( -2048 )² - 4*24*2b > 0.

Compute that:

2048² - 192b > 0.

2048² = (2000 + 48)^2 = 2000² + 2*2000*48 + 48² = 4,000,000 + 192,000 + 2,304 = 4,194,304.

So, 4,194,304 - 192b > 0 => 192b < 4,194,304 => b < 4,194,304 / 192 ≈ 21,856. So, as long as b is less than approximately 21,856, the derivative has two real roots, meaning the original cubic has a local maximum and a minimum. But to have three distinct real roots, not only do we need two critical points, but the function values at these critical points must straddle the x-axis. That is, the local maximum must be above the x-axis and the local minimum must be below, or vice versa. 

However, calculating the exact values of these critical points and their corresponding function values would require knowing 'b', which we don't have. But perhaps we can relate 'b' to the roots. Recall that from Vieta's formulas:

Sum of roots: α + β + γ = 128.

Sum of products: αβ + αγ + βγ = b/4.

Product: αβγ = 32.

So, if we can find such roots α, β, γ > 0, distinct, summing to 128, multiplying to 32, then b is determined as 4(αβ + αγ + βγ). 

But is there a contradiction here? Let's consider the relationship between the sum, product, and sum of products. For three positive numbers, we have inequalities like AM ≥ GM. The arithmetic mean here is 128/3 ≈ 42.666, and the geometric mean is (32)^(1/3) ≈ 3.1748. So, AM ≫ GM, which is possible. However, the sum of products (αβ + αγ + βγ) is another measure. Let's see if such a sum is possible.

Suppose two roots are very small, approaching zero, and the third root approaches 128. Then, the product would be approximately 0, but we need the product to be 32. So, that's not possible. Therefore, the roots can't be too extreme. Let's consider the case where two roots are equal. Wait, but the problem states three distinct roots, so they can't be equal. 

Alternatively, let's try to see if such roots can exist. Let's assume that all three roots are equal. Then, each would be 128/3 ≈ 42.666, and the product would be (128/3)^3 ≈ (128)^3 / 27 ≈ 2,097,152 / 27 ≈ 77,672.7, which is way larger than 32. So, if all roots are equal, the product is way too big. But we need the product to be 32. Therefore, to reduce the product, some roots need to be smaller, while others are larger. However, since the sum is fixed at 128, making some roots smaller would require others to be larger. 

But even so, the product being 32 is quite small. Let's see. Suppose we have two roots as 1, then the third root would be 128 - 2 = 126. Then the product would be 1*1*126 = 126, which is still larger than 32. If we have two roots as 2, then the third is 128 - 4 = 124, product is 2*2*124 = 496. Still too big. If we have two roots as 4, third is 116, product is 4*4*116 = 1,856. Hmm, not getting smaller. Wait, maybe if we have one root very small, say ε, and the other two roots such that their sum is 128 - ε. Then, the product would be ε*(something). To get the product down to 32, we need ε*(other two roots) = 32. If ε is very small, then the other two roots would need to be very large. For example, let ε approach 0, then the other two roots approach 128/2 = 64 each. Then, their product would approach 64*64 = 4,096, so the total product would approach 0*4,096 = 0. But we need the product to be 32. Therefore, there must be a balance. 

Let's attempt to find such roots. Let me set up equations:

Let’s denote the roots as α, β, γ. Then:

α + β + γ = 128  
αβ + αγ + βγ = S (let's denote this as S)  
αβγ = 32

We need to find positive real numbers α, β, γ satisfying these equations. Let's see if such numbers exist.

Suppose we fix two roots and solve for the third. Let's say α and β are variables, then γ = 128 - α - β. Then the product equation becomes αβ(128 - α - β) = 32. This is a equation in two variables, which likely has solutions. For example, let's choose α = 1. Then, β(128 - 1 - β) = 32 / 1 = 32. So:

β(127 - β) = 32  
127β - β² = 32  
β² - 127β + 32 = 0

Solving this quadratic equation:

β = [127 ± sqrt(127² - 128)] / 2  
= [127 ± sqrt(16129 - 128)] / 2  
= [127 ± sqrt(16001)] / 2  
≈ [127 ± 126.56] / 2

So, two solutions:

β ≈ (127 + 126.56)/2 ≈ 253.56/2 ≈ 126.78  
β ≈ (127 - 126.56)/2 ≈ 0.44/2 ≈ 0.22

Therefore, if α = 1, then β ≈ 126.78 or 0.22. Then, γ = 128 - 1 - β ≈ 126.78 or 128 - 1 - 0.22 ≈ 126.78. Wait, but in the first case, if α = 1 and β ≈ 126.78, then γ ≈ 128 - 1 - 126.78 ≈ 0.22. Similarly, in the second case, α = 1, β ≈ 0.22, γ ≈ 126.78. So, in both cases, we have two roots: one small (≈0.22), one medium (≈1), and one very small (≈0.22). Wait, but in the first case, we have roots ≈1, ≈126.78, ≈0.22. All positive, distinct. So, that's a valid set of roots. 

Therefore, such roots exist. Therefore, the cubic equation with a = -256 and corresponding b would have three distinct positive roots. Therefore, the answer is a = -256. 

But let me just confirm once more. The problem states "three distinct positive roots". We found that with a = -256, such roots exist. Therefore, the answer is indeed -256. I think that's solid.

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1, execution_2.2:
But let's go back to the problem. The problem didn't ask us to find the roots or 'b', just the value of 'a', which we found to be -256. However, just to be thorough, let's check if this is consistent with the other conditions.

Wait, but we need to ensure that the roots are distinct. In the example above, we found roots approximately 1, 0.22, and 126.78, which are all distinct. Therefore, such roots exist, so the value of 'a' is indeed -256.
Therefore, the answer is \boxed{-256}.
