<Question>
The expression $2\cdot 3 \cdot 4\cdot 5+1$ is equal to 121, since multiplication is carried out before addition. However, we can obtain values other than 121 for this expression if we are allowed to change it by inserting parentheses. For example, we can obtain 144 by writing \[
(2\cdot (3\cdot 4)) \cdot (5+1) = 144.
\]In total, how many values can be obtained from the expression $2\cdot 3\cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1$ by inserting parentheses? (Note that rearranging terms is not allowed, only inserting parentheses).
</Question>

<think>
<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to figure out how many different values can be obtained from the expression 2·3·4·5 + 1 by just inserting parentheses. Rearranging the terms isn't allowed, only changing the order of operations with parentheses. Hmm, let's start by understanding the original expression.

<prompt_1.1> Understand the original expression and determine its value without any parentheses. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
The original expression is 2 multiplied by 3, multiplied by 4, multiplied by 5, and then adding 1. Since multiplication has higher precedence than addition, we do all the multiplications first: 2*3*4*5 = 120, then add 1 to get 121. But the problem says we can get other values by inserting parentheses. So, parentheses change the order of operations, which can affect the result.
</execution_1.1>
</Execution_1>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
First, let's recall that inserting parentheses can change the order in which operations are performed. In this expression, we have four numbers and three multiplications, then an addition. The numbers are fixed in order (can't rearrange them), so we can only group them differently.

<prompt_2.1> Identify the different ways to insert parentheses into the expression 2·3·4·5 + 1. </prompt_2.1>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Let me list all possible ways to parenthesize this expression. The expression is 2·3·4·5 + 1. Let's break it down.

First, the multiplication part is 2·3·4·5. Since multiplication is associative, different ways of parenthesizing it can change the grouping but not the result because multiplication is commutative and associative. Wait, but if we add parentheses in different ways, even if the multiplication order is the same, does it affect the result? Wait, no, because multiplication is associative, so different parenthesizations of the same numbers multiplied together will yield the same result. However, when we add the +1 at the end, the position where we do the addition can affect the total.
</execution_2.1>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
So, maybe the key is where we place the addition. For example, in the given example, they did (2·(3·4))·(5+1). So here, they grouped 5+1 together first, then multiplied that result with the product of 2, 3, and 4. Alternatively, if we group the addition earlier, we might get a different result.

Wait, let's think. The original expression is 2·3·4·5 +1. The standard evaluation is ( ((2·3)·4) ·5 ) +1. But if we insert parentheses to delay the addition until later, we can get different results.

So the idea is that the addition can be placed in different positions relative to the multiplications. The different parenthesizations will determine where the addition happens.

So perhaps we need to consider all possible parenthesizations of the multiplication part and see how the addition can be integrated.

But since the addition is outside the multiplication, depending on where we place the parentheses, the addition can occur at different "levels" of the multiplication tree.

Let me think in terms of binary trees.

<prompt_3.1> Consider different parenthesizations of the multiplication part and their effect on the result. </prompt_3.1>

But maybe that's complicating it. Let's approach it step by step.

First, let's consider all possible ways to parenthesize the four numbers 2,3,4,5 with multiplication, and then see where the +1 can be inserted.

<prompt_3.2> Explore different parenthesizations of the expression 2·3·4·5 + 1. </prompt_3.2>

But wait, maybe there are more. Let's see.

Another way: ((2·3)·(4·5)) +1. Wait, that's ((2*3)*(4*5)) +1 = (6*20)+1=120+1=121. So that's the same as the original. Hmm.

Another way: (2·(3·4))·(5+1). That's the example given, which is 144. Let's see if there are others.

Alternatively, 2·((3·4)·(5+1)). Wait, that would be 2*(12*6)=2*72=144. Same as before.

Alternatively, (2·3)·(4·(5+1)).

<prompt_3.3> Explore additional parenthesizations and calculate their results. </prompt_3.3>
-----

Another way: 2·(3·(4·(5+1))). Let's compute that.

<prompt_3.4> Explore further parenthesizations and calculate their results. </prompt_3.4>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
The expression 2·3·4·5 can be parenthesized in different ways. For four numbers, the number of parenthesizations is the third Catalan number, which is 5. But since we can also add 1 at different points, maybe the total number of different values is more than 5.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
Wait, but the expression is 2·3·4·5 +1. So the operations are three multiplications and one addition. The total expression has four numbers and three operations. The different ways to parenthesize would affect how the multiplications are grouped, but since multiplication is associative, different groupings of multiplications may not change the result. However, if the addition is placed in different positions, that can affect the total.

Wait, but in the example given, they grouped the 5+1 together first, then multiplied. So the key is that the addition can be performed at different levels of the multiplication tree.
</execution_3.2>

<execution_3.3>
Let's compute that: (2*3)=6, (5+1)=6, then 4*6=24, then 6*24=144. Same result again. So maybe different parenthesizations lead to the same result. So maybe the key is to figure out all possible distinct ways the addition can be integrated into the multiplication sequence.
</execution_3.3>

<execution_3.4>
First, 5+1=6. Then 4*6=24. Then 3*24=72. Then 2*72=144. So again 144. So regardless of where the parentheses are placed around the multiplications, as long as the +1 is at the end, the result is 144? Wait, no. Wait, in this case, the +1 is nested deeper.

Wait, no. Let me check. If I have 2·(3·(4·(5+1))). So the innermost parentheses are 5+1=6. Then 4·6=24. Then 3·24=72. Then 2·72=144. So same as before.

Alternatively, 2·((3·4)·(5+1)) is 2·(12·6)=2·72=144. So regardless of how we parenthesize the multiplications around the +1, we get 144.

Wait, but is that the only other value? Let's check another possibility.

<prompt_4.6> Verify if there are any other distinct values by considering different parenthesizations. </prompt_4.6>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
First, 4·5=20, then 20+1=21. Then 3·21=63. Then 2·63=126. Wait, no. Wait, the expression is 2·(3·(4·(5+1))). Wait, no, the parentheses are around 4·(5+1). So 4·(5+1)=4*6=24. Then 3·24=72. Then 2·72=144. So same as before. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps if the addition is done earlier. Let me think. For example, if we do (2·3)·4·5 +1. Wait, but that's the same as ((2·3)·4)·5 +1 = 120 +1=121. So that's original.

Alternatively, if we do 2·(3·4)·(5+1). Let's compute: 3·4=12, 5+1=6, then 2·12·6=2*12=24, 24*6=144. Again 144.

Alternatively, 2·3·(4·(5+1)). Let's compute: 5+1=6, 4·6=24, then 2·3=6, 6·24=144. Still 144.
</execution_4.1>

<execution_4.2>
Wait, but (3·4·5) is 60, then +1 is 61, then 2*61=122. That's a different value. So 122 is another possible result.

Wait, so depending on where we place the parentheses, we can get different results.
</execution_4.2>

<execution_4.3>
Wait, 4·5 is multiplication before addition? Wait, no. Wait, in (4·5 +1), the multiplication 4·5 would be done first because of precedence? Wait, no, if we have 4·5 +1, that's 20 +1=21. So yes, 21. Then 6*21=126.
</execution_4.3>

<execution_4.4>
First, 4*5=20, 20+1=21, then 3*21=63, then 2*63=126. Same as above.

Another way: (2·3)·(4·(5+1)). Let's compute: 2*3=6, 5+1=6, 4*6=24, 6*24=144.
</execution_4.4>

<execution_4.5>
Alternatively, (2·(3·4))·(5+1)=144, (2·3)·(4·(5+1))=144, ((2·3·4)·5)+1=121, (2·3·(4·5))+1=2*3*20 +1=120 +1=121, (2·(3·4·5)) +1=2*60 +1=121, ((2·3)·4·5)+1=24*5 +1=121. So all other groupings either result in 121 or 144 or 122 or 126. Wait, let's check another possibility.
</execution_4.5>

<execution_4.6>
What if we do (2+1)·3·4·5? But wait, we can't rearrange terms, only insert parentheses. So addition can't be moved to the front. The original expression has the addition at the end. So all the multiplications are on the left side of the addition. So we can't change the order of the numbers, only where the operations are performed.

Therefore, the +1 is always at the end, and the multiplications are on the left. So the different ways are how we group the multiplications before adding 1.

Another way: (2·3·4·5) +1, which is 120 +1=121.

Wait, seems like the only different results are 121, 122, 126, 144. Let's verify if there are any others.
</execution_5.1>

<execution_5.2>
Since the addition is a single operation at the end, the value depends on when we perform that addition. Wait, but in the given example, they added 1 after multiplying 5 by something. Wait, actually, in the original expression, the addition is at the end. So if we can insert parentheses, we can choose to add 1 at different points in the multiplication sequence. Wait, but how?

Wait, for example, if we have 2·3·4·5 +1, by inserting parentheses, we can make the addition happen earlier in the multiplication sequence. For instance, if we do (2·3·4·(5+1)), but that would require moving the addition to the end of the multiplications. Wait, but the original expression is 2·3·4·5 +1. So the addition is after the multiplications. If we want to add 1 earlier, we need to change the structure. For example, if we do 2·3·(4·5 +1). Let's compute that: 4·5=20, 20+1=21, then 2·3=6, 6·21=126. So here, the addition is after multiplying 4 and 5, then multiplying by 3 and 2. Similarly, 2·(3·4·5 +1): 3·4·5=60, 60+1=61, 2·61=122. Or (2·3·4)·(5+1): 2·3·4=24, 5+1=6, 24·6=144. Or 2·(3·(4·5 +1))=126, as before.

So the different parenthesizations can cause the addition to occur at different points in the multiplication sequence. So depending on where the addition is nested within the multiplications, the result changes.

<Execution_6>
<execution_6.1>
The multiplications are 2,3,4,5. The addition is +1. The different ways to insert parentheses would determine where the +1 is applied. For example:

1. ((2·3)·4)·5 +1 = (6·4)·5 +1 = 24·5 +1 = 120 +1 = 121

2. (2·3)·(4·5) +1 = 6·20 +1 = 120 +1 = 121

3. 2·(3·(4·5)) +1 = 2·(12·5) +1 = 2·60 +1 = 120 +1 = 121

4. (2·3·4)·5 +1 = 24·5 +1 = 120 +1 = 121

5. 2·3·(4·5) +1 = 6·20 +1 = 120 +1 = 121

6. 2·(3·4)·5 +1 = 2·12·5 +1 = 24·5 +1 = 120 +1 = 121

7. ((2·3)·(4·5)) +1 = (6·20) +1 = 120 +1 = 121

All these are the same as the original expression because the multiplication is associative, so different groupings don't change the product. Therefore, if we don't change the order of operations, all groupings result in 120 +1 = 121. However, if we can change the order by inserting parentheses, but the problem states we cannot rearrange terms, only insert parentheses. Wait, but in the given example, they changed the order by grouping differently, but still kept the same order of numbers. So, for example, in the given example: 2·(3·(4·(5+1))). Here, they changed the grouping, but kept the order of multiplication as 2,3,4,5. So the product is still 2*3*4*5, which is 120, then added 1. Wait, but in the example, they did 4·(5+1) first, which is 4*6=24, then 3·24=72, then 2·72=144. Wait, but that's 2·(3·(4·(5+1))) which is ((2)·(3))·(4·(5+1))). Wait, but 2·(3·(4·(5+1))) is different from 2·3·4·5 +1. Wait, actually, if you parse the parentheses, 2·(3·(4·(5+1))) is equivalent to 2 * (3 * (4 * (5 + 1))). So the operations are 5+1 first, then 4*(result), then 3*(result), then 2*(result). So the expression becomes 2*(3*(4*(5+1))). Which is different from the original left-associated expression. So in this case, the result is 144.

Therefore, by changing the grouping, we can change the order in which the additions and multiplications are performed, thus changing the result.

Therefore, the key is to figure out all possible ways to insert parentheses (i.e., different orders of operations) that result in different values when computing 2·3·4·5 +1.

<Plan_7>
Based on execution_6.1:
Since we can't rearrange the terms, only insert parentheses, we need to consider different ways to nest the operations. Let's model this as different binary trees for the multiplication part, with the addition still at the end.

</Plan_7>

<Execution_7>
<execution_7.1>
Each multiplication is binary, so each operation combines two numbers at a time. The addition is a separate operation at the end. So the problem reduces to: how many different ways can we parenthesize the product 2·3·4·5, and then add 1 at the end. Each different parenthesization can lead to a different result if the order of operations changes the product.

Wait, but since multiplication is associative, normally the product is the same regardless of grouping. However, if we have different groupings that effectively change the order of multiplication (which is not allowed here because we can't rearrange terms), but the parentheses can change the association. Wait, but in standard associativity, the product remains the same. For example, (2·3)·4·5 = 2·(3·4)·5 = 2·3·(4·5), etc. So all these should be equal. But in the given example, they have 2·(3·(4·(5+1))), which is different because the addition is inside. So the presence of the addition changes the structure.

Wait, but if we consider the addition as a separate operation, the overall expression is a combination of multiplications and one addition. The key is that the addition can be nested at different levels of the multiplication tree, leading to different results.

= 121

2. (2·3)·(4·5) +1 = 6·20 +1 = 121

3. 2·(3·4·5) +1 = 2·60 +1 = 121

4. (2·3·4)·5 +1 = 24·5 +1 = 121

All these are the same.

But if we change the grouping to delay the multiplication with 5 until after adding 1:

2·(3·(4·(5+1))) = 2·(3·(4·6)) = 2·(3·24) = 2·72 = 144

Similarly, (2·3)·(4·(5+1)) = 6·24 = 144

2·((3·4)·(5+1)) = 2·(12·6) = 2·72 = 144

(2·(3·4·5)) +1 = 2·60 +1 = 121

Wait, but if we do 2·(3·(4·5 +1)) = 2·(3·21) = 2·63 = 126

Similarly, (2·3·4·5 +1) is 121. But if we do (2·3)·(4·5) +1 = 6·20 +1=121. If we do 2·(3·(4·5 +1)) =126.

Alternatively, (2·3·4·(5+1)) =24·6=144. But 5+1 is at the end, so it's multiplication by 6. But if we do 2·3·(4·5 +1) =6·21=126. Similarly, 2·(3·(4·5 +1))=126.

Alternatively, (2·3·(4·5 +1)) =126. Also, 2·(3·(4·(5+1)))=144. So these are different.

Another way: ((2·3·4)·5) +1=120+1=121. If we change the grouping to ((2·3)·(4·5)) +1=6·20 +1=121. But if we do (2·(3·4·5)) +1=2·60 +1=121. Alternatively, (2·3·4·5) +1=121. So all these groupings result in 121. The only different results are when we introduce the addition earlier in the sequence.

So when we have:

- 2·(3·(4·(5+1))) =144

- 2·(3·(4·5 +1))=126

- 2·(3·4·5) +1=121 (but that's same as original)

Wait, no. Wait, 4·5 +1 inside the parentheses: 3·(4·5 +1). So 4·5=20, 20+1=21, then 3·21=63, then 2·63=126.

Similarly, 3·(4·(5+1))=3·24=72, then 2·72=144.

Alternatively, if we do (2·3·4·5) +1=120+1=121. But if we do 2·(3·4·(5+1))=2·(12·6)=2·72=144.

Alternatively, (2·3)·4·(5+1)=6·24=144.

Alternatively, 2·3·(4·5 +1)=6·21=126.

Alternatively, 2·(3·(4·5 +1))=126.

So the different possible results are:

- 121 (all groupings that result in 2*3*4*5 +1)

- 122 (2*(3*(4*5 +1)))

- 126 (2*(3*(4*(5+1))))

- 144 ((2*3)*(4*(5+1)))

So that's four distinct values.

9. 2·(3·4·5 +1) = 2·61 = 122

4. 2·(3·(4·5 +1)) = 2·(3·21) = 2·63 = 126. Correct.

5. (2·3)·(4·(5+1)) = 6·24 = 144. Correct.

6. (2·3·4)·(5+1) = 24·6 = 144. Correct.

7. 2·(3·4·(5+1)) = 2·(12·6) = 2·72 = 144. Correct.

8. (2·3)·4·(5+1) = 6·24 = 144. Correct.

9. 2·(3·4·5 +1) = 2·(60 +1) = 2·61 = 122. Correct.

10. (2·3·4·5) +1 = 120 +1 = 121. Correct.

So yes, the results are 121, 122, 126, and 144. Therefore, the total number of distinct values is 4.

Based on execution_9.1:
But wait, let me check if there are any other possible parenthesizations that could lead to different results. For example, is there a way to get 2·3·4 +5·1? Wait, but that would require changing the order of operations in a way that's not allowed. Since we can only insert parentheses, not rearrange terms.

<prompt_10.1> Consider all possible parenthesizations and verify if they lead to any new results. </prompt_10.1>

But wait, let me check another way. Let's list all possible insertion of parentheses in the expression 2·3·4·5 +1, considering only multiplication and addition, and see how many different ways the addition can be nested.

<prompt_10.2> Summarize the distinct values obtained from different parenthesizations. </prompt_10.2>

<Execution_10>
<execution_10.1>
Let's see. Let's list all possible parenthesizations of the multiplication part (2·3·4·5) and see what results we get:

1. ((2·3)·4)·5 = 120

2. (2·3)·(4·5) = 6·20 = 120

3. 2·(3·4)·5 = 2·12·5 = 120

4. 2·(3·(4·5)) = 2·3·20 = 120

5. (2·3·4)·5 = 24·5 = 120

6. 2·((3·4)·5) = 2·12·5 = 120

All these are 120. So adding 1 gives 121.

But if we change the grouping to include the addition earlier:

1. 2·(3·(4·(5+1))) = 2·(3·24) = 144

2. 2·(3·(4·5 +1)) = 2·63 = 126

3. (2·3)·(4·(5+1)) = 6·24 = 144

4. 2·((3·4)·(5+1)) = 2·(12·6) = 144

5. (2·3·4)·(5+1) = 24·6 = 144

6. (2·3)·(4·(5+1)) = 6·24 = 144

7. 2·(3·4·(5+1)) = 2·72 = 144

8. (2·3·4·5) +1 = 120 +1 = 121

9. 2·(3·(4·5 +1)) = 2·63 = 126

10. (2·3·4·5) +1 = 121

So all possible parenthesizations either result in 121, 122, 126, or 144. Therefore, the distinct values are 121, 122, 126, 144. Thus, total of 4 distinct values.

Therefore, the answer should be 4. But let me check if there are any other possible groupings that might result in different values. For example, if we do 2·(3 + 4)·5 +1, but that would require changing the order of operations by adding parentheses around 3 +4, but since we can't rearrange terms, only insert parentheses, this is not allowed. The problem states that we cannot rearrange terms, only insert parentheses. So we can't create new groupings that change the order of terms, only associate them differently.

Another check: Let's consider all possible ways the +1 can be associated. The +1 is at the end, so it's like adding 1 after some sub-expression. The possible sub-expressions where the +1 can be nested are at different levels of the multiplication tree. So the +1 can be at the same level as the entire product (resulting in 121), one level below (resulting in 122 or 126), or two levels below (resulting in 144). Hence, four distinct association points, leading to four distinct results.

Therefore, the total number of values is 4.

<execution_10.2>
The expression has four multiplications and one addition. The addition can be associated with different levels of the multiplication expressions.

The possible ways to parenthesize are such that the addition can be at the top level, or nested inside one of the multiplication operations.

The possible distinct results occur when the addition is nested at different depths in the multiplication expression tree.

So, the possible distinct values are:

- When the addition is at the deepest level (rightmost): 2·(3·(4·5)) +1 = 2·60 +1 = 121.

- When the addition is one level up: 2·(3·(4·(5+1))) = 144, or 2·((3·4)·(5+1)) = 144, etc.

- When the addition is one level up: 2·(3·(4·5 +1)) = 126.

- When the addition is at the top level: 2·3·4·5 +1 = 121. Wait, but if we can't rearrange terms, how do we get the addition at the top level? Wait, the original expression has the addition at the end. To have the addition at the top level, we need to parenthesize the addition with the multiplications. For example, (2·3·4·5) +1. But that's the original expression. However, if we can nest the addition earlier, but in this case, the only way to have the addition at the top level is if we don't group it with any multiplications. But since we can only insert parentheses, not change the order, the only way is to have the addition as the last operation. So, actually, the addition can't be nested deeper than the multiplications. Wait, but in the given example, they nested the addition inside the multiplications. So the different values come from how deep the addition is nested within the multiplication structure.

Therefore, the possible distinct values are determined by how deep the addition is nested. The possible nesting levels for the addition are:

1. Directly after the multiplications: 121.

2. One level inside: 122, 126, 144.

But according to our calculations, only three distinct values: 122, 126, 144, and 121. So four values in total.

But let me check once more if there are other possibilities. For example, can we have the addition split between two multiplications? For example, (2·3) + (4·5) +1. But that would require two additions, which we aren't allowed to do. The original expression only has one addition. Since we can't rearrange terms or insert operations, only insert parentheses, we can't introduce more additions. Therefore, the addition can only appear once in the expression, either at the deepest level or nested within the multiplications. Therefore, the possible results are as above.

Based on execution_10.2:
Therefore, the answer is 4.

But wait, let me check if there's a possibility of another value. For example, if we do 2·(3 +4)·5 +1, but that would require changing the order of operations by adding parentheses around 3 +4, which isn't allowed here. The problem states we can only insert parentheses, not rearrange terms. So such a grouping is invalid.

Therefore, the only valid groupings are those that maintain the original order of terms, only changing the association. Hence, the four distinct values are confirmed.
