Okay, so I need to find the value of x that makes the equation 2³ · 3ˣ = 72 true. Let me start by breaking down the problem step by step. First, I should probably simplify the left side of the equation as much as possible.

<prompt_1.1> Simplify the left side of the equation 2³ · 3ˣ = 72 by calculating 2³. </prompt_1.1>

I know that 2³ is 8, right? So substituting that in, the equation becomes 8 · 3ˣ = 72. Now, I need to solve for x in this equation. Hmm, let me think. If I divide both sides by 8, that should isolate the term with x. Let me try that: 3ˣ = 72 / 8. Calculating the right side, 72 divided by 8 is 9. So now the equation is 3ˣ = 9.

Based on execution_1.1:
Wait, 3 to the what power is 9? Well, 3 squared is 9 because 3 · 3 = 9. So does that mean x is 2?

Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

<prompt_2.1> Verify the solution by re-evaluating the steps from simplifying 2³ · 3ˣ = 72 to solving for x. </prompt_2.1>

Another way to approach this might be to use logarithms. Taking the natural log of both sides: ln(2³ · 3ˣ) = ln(72). Using logarithm properties, that's ln(2³) + ln(3ˣ) = ln(72).
Which simplifies to 3 ln 2 + x ln 3 = ln 72. Then, solving for x: x ln 3 = ln 72 - 3 ln 2, so x = (ln 72 - 3 ln 2) / ln 3.

Let me compute that numerically to confirm.

<prompt_2.2> Use logarithms to solve the equation 2³ · 3ˣ = 72 and verify if the solution matches x = 2. </prompt_2.2>

Alternatively, I could express 72 as a product of powers of 2 and 3 to compare exponents. Let's factor 72.

<prompt_2.3> Factor 72 into its prime factors and compare exponents with 2³ · 3ˣ to solve for x. </prompt_2.3>

<execution_2.1>
Starting with the original equation: 2³ · 3ˣ = 72. Calculating 2³ gives 8, so 8 · 3ˣ = 72. Dividing both sides by 8: 3ˣ = 9. Since 9 is 3 squared, x must be 2.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
First, calculate ln 72. Let's see, 72 is 8 · 9, which is 2³ · 3². So ln 72 = ln(2³ · 3²) = 3 ln 2 + 2 ln 3. Then, 3 ln 2 is subtracted by 3 ln 2, so those terms cancel out. That leaves x ln 3 = 2 ln 3, so dividing both sides by ln 3 gives x = 2.
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
72 divided by 2 is 36, divided by 2 again is 18, again by 2 is 9, which is 3². So 72 = 2³ · 3². Therefore, the equation 2³ · 3ˣ = 2³ · 3². Since the bases are the same and the exponents must be equal for the equation to hold, x must be 2.

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
But maybe I should check if there's another way to approach this problem or if there's a possibility I overlooked something. For example, could there be a negative exponent or a fractional exponent that also satisfies 3ˣ = 9?

<prompt_3.1> Consider if there are any other possible solutions for 3ˣ = 9, such as negative or fractional exponents. </prompt_3.1>

Based on execution_2.2, execution_2.3:
I think all methods converge to x = 2, so that must be the correct answer.
I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that x = 2 is the solution.

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
Well, 3⁰ is 1, 3⁻¹ is 1/3, and so on, but those aren't going to give 9. So no, x has to be 2.
</execution_3.1>
</Execution_3>

<Final_answer>
Therefore, the value of $x$ for which $2^3\cdot3^x=72$ is $\boxed{2}$.
