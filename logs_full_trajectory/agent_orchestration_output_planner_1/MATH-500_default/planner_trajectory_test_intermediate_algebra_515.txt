Okay, so I need to find the horizontal asymptote for the function y = (4x³ + 2x - 4)/(3x³ - 2x² + 5x - 1). Hmm, horizontal asymptotes... I remember they have something to do with the behavior of the function as x approaches infinity or negative infinity. Let me try to recall the rules for horizontal asymptotes in rational functions.

First, a rational function is a ratio of two polynomials. The degrees of the numerator and the denominator are important here. If the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is y = 0.
If they are the same degree, the horizontal asymptote is the ratio of the leading coefficients. And if the degree of the numerator is higher than the denominator, there's no horizontal asymptote, but there might be an oblique (slant) asymptote.

<prompt_1.1> Identify the degrees of the numerator and denominator and determine the type of asymptote based on their comparison. </prompt_1.1>

Let me check. The numerator is 4x³ + 2x - 4. The leading term is 4x³. The denominator is 3x³ - 2x² + 5x - 1. The leading term here is 3x³. Since both are degree 3, they have the same degree.
Therefore, the horizontal asymptote should be the ratio of the leading coefficients, which is 4/3.

Wait, so is it 4/3? But let me think again. What if there's a mistake in identifying the degrees? Let me confirm.

<prompt_1.2> Reconfirm the identification of the degrees of the numerator and denominator. </prompt_1.2>

Another way to think about it is to take the limit as x approaches infinity of (4x³ + 2x -4)/(3x³ -2x² +5x -1). To evaluate this limit, divide numerator and denominator by the highest power of x in the denominator, which is x³.

<prompt_1.3> Evaluate the limit as x approaches infinity by dividing numerator and denominator by x³. </prompt_1.3>

But let me check with actual numbers. Suppose x is very large, say x = 1000.

<prompt_1.4> Verify the horizontal asymptote by evaluating the function for large values of x. </prompt_1.4>

But just to be thorough, let's also consider the limit as x approaches negative infinity. If x is a large negative number, say x = -1000.

<prompt_1.5> Evaluate the limit as x approaches negative infinity by dividing numerator and denominator by x³. </prompt_1.5>

Wait, in this case, the degrees are both 3. So, the horizontal asymptote would be the ratio of the leading coefficients. That would be 4 divided by 3, so y = 4/3.
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
Numerator: 4x³ + 2x -4. The highest power is x³. Denominator: 3x³ -2x² +5x -1. Highest power is x³. So yes, both are degree 3. Therefore, the horizontal asymptote is the ratio of the leading coefficients: 4 divided by 3, so y = 4/3.
</execution_1.2>

<execution_1.3>
That gives:

Limit = (4 + 2/x² - 4/x³)/(3 - 2/x + 5/x² - 1/x³)

As x approaches infinity, the terms with 1/x, 1/x², etc. , will approach zero. So the limit becomes (4 + 0 - 0)/(3 + 0 + 0 - 0) = 4/3.
</execution_1.3>

<execution_1.4>
Then the numerator is approximately 4*(1000)^3, and the denominator is approximately 3*(1000)^3. So the ratio is roughly 4/3, ignoring the smaller terms. Similarly, for x = -1000, the leading terms are still 4*(-1000)^3 and 3*(-1000)^3, so the ratio is 4/3 again. So regardless of whether x is approaching positive or negative infinity, the horizontal asymptote is 4/3.
</execution_1.4>

<execution_1.5>
The leading terms would still be 4x³ in the numerator and 3x³ in the denominator. So 4*(-1000)^3 / 3*(-1000)^3 = 4/3 as well. So regardless of the direction, the horizontal asymptote is 4/3.

Based on execution_1.1:
Is that right?

Wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. Sometimes there are exceptions or special cases.
For example, if the leading coefficients are zero, but in this case, both leading coefficients are non-zero.

So that's the standard rule. Let me also think about an example. Suppose we have (2x³ + ... )/(5x³ + ... ), then as x gets very large, the ... becomes negligible, so the function behaves like 2x³/5x³ = 2/5. Therefore, y approaches 2/5. So in this problem, it's 4/3.

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Therefore, the horizontal asymptote is y = 4/3. So the answer should be \boxed{\dfrac{4}{3}}.

Therefore, after considering multiple approaches and verifying with examples, I can confidently say the horizontal asymptote is at y = 4/3.
