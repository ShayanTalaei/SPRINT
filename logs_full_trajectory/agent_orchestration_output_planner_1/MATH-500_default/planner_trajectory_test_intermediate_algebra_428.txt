Okay, so I need to find the roots of the equation (x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3. Hmm, let's see. First, I should probably try to simplify this equation step by step. Maybe expanding the cubes would help, but that might get messy. Let me think if there's a smarter way to approach this.

Let me check if there's a pattern here. The left side has two cubes added together, and the right side is another cube. Maybe there's a way to use the identity a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)^3 - 3ab(a + b). Let me recall that identity. Yeah, that's right. So if I apply that here, maybe the equation can be transformed into something more manageable.

Let me set a = x - 3 and b = x - 7. Then the left side is a^3 + b^3. According to the identity, that's equal to (a + b)^3 - 3ab(a + b). Let's compute a + b first. a + b = (x - 3) + (x - 7) = 2x - 10. Wait a minute, that's exactly the expression on the right side of the original equation! So the right side is (2x - 10)^3, which is (a + b)^3. So substituting into the identity, we have:

a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)^3 - 3ab(a + b)

But the original equation says that a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)^3. Therefore, substituting the identity into the equation gives:

(a + b)^3 - 3ab(a + b) = (a + b)^3

Subtracting (a + b)^3 from both sides, we get:

-3ab(a + b) = 0

Based on execution_1.1:
So this equation is satisfied if either a = 0, b = 0, or (a + b) = 0. Let's write that down:

Either:
1. a = 0 ⇒ x - 3 = 0 ⇒ x = 3
2. b = 0 ⇒ x - 7 = 0 ⇒ x = 7
3. a + b = 0 ⇒ 2x - 10 = 0 ⇒ 2x = 10 ⇒ x = 5

So the solutions are x = 3, x = 7, and x = 5. Therefore, the roots of the equation are 3, 5, and 7.

Wait, but let me verify this. Let me plug these values back into the original equation to check if they actually satisfy it.

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this problem. For example, expanding all the terms. Let's try that as a cross-check.

<prompt_2.2> Expand all the terms of the equation (x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3 and solve the resulting equation. </prompt_2.2>

Starting with x = 3:

Left side: (3 - 3)^3 + (3 - 7)^3 = 0^3 + (-4)^3 = 0 + (-64) = -64

Right side: (2*3 - 10)^3 = (6 - 10)^3 = (-4)^3 = -64

Okay, that works.

<execution_2.2>
Left side: (x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3.

Expanding each cube:

(x - 3)^3 = x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27

(x - 7)^3 = x^3 - 21x^2 + 147x - 343

Adding them together:

x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27 + x^3 - 21x^2 + 147x - 343 = 2x^3 - 30x^2 + 174x - 370

Right side: (2x - 10)^3 = 8x^3 - 120x^2 + 600x - 1000

So the equation becomes:

2x^3 - 30x^2 + 174x - 370 = 8x^3 - 120x^2 + 600x - 1000

Bring all terms to the left side:

2x^3 - 30x^2 + 174x - 370 - 8x^3 + 120x^2 - 600x + 1000 = 0

Combine like terms:

(2x^3 - 8x^3) + (-30x^2 + 120x^2) + (174x - 600x) + (-370 + 1000) = 0

-6x^3 + 90x^2 - 426x + 630 = 0

Multiply both sides by -1 to make the leading coefficient positive:

6x^3 - 90x^2 + 426x - 630 = 0

Divide both sides by 6 to simplify:

x^3 - 15x^2 + 71x - 105 = 0

So now we have a cubic equation: x^3 - 15x^2 + 71x - 105 = 0. Let's try to factor this. Maybe using the Rational Root Theorem, possible rational roots are factors of 105 over 1, so ±1, ±3, ±5, ±7, ±15, ±21, ±35, ±105.

Let's test x=3:

3^3 -15*(3)^2 +71*3 -105 = 27 - 135 + 213 -105 = (27 -135) + (213 -105) = (-108) + 108 = 0. So x=3 is a root.

Similarly, test x=5:

5^3 -15*25 +71*5 -105 = 125 - 375 + 355 -105 = (125 -375) + (355 -105) = (-250) + 250 = 0. So x=5 is a root.

Test x=7:

7^3 -15*49 +71*7 -105 = 343 - 735 + 497 -105 = (343 -735) + (497 -105) = (-392) + 392 = 0. So x=7 is a root.

Therefore, the cubic factors as (x - 3)(x -5)(x -7) = 0, which confirms the roots are 3,5,7. So expanding and solving also gives the same result.

Based on execution_2.1:
Let me check x = 7:

<prompt_3.1> Verify the solutions x = 3, x = 7, and x = 5 by plugging them back into the original equation. </prompt_3.1>

Based on execution_2.2:
Therefore, both methods lead to the same conclusion, so the roots are definitely 3, 5, and 7. But wait, just to be thorough, sometimes when you cube terms or manipulate equations, you might introduce extraneous solutions or lose some, but in this case, since we used algebraic identities and verified each solution, they all check out.
Also, when we expanded the equation, we ended up with a cubic that factors exactly into (x -3)(x -5)(x -7), so there are no other roots. Hence, the original equation has three real roots at x=3,5,7.

**Final Answer**
The roots are \boxed{3}, \boxed{5}, and \boxed{7}.
