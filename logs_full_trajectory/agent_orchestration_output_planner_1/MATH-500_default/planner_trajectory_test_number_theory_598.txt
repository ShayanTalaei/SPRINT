Convert $\frac{21}{2^2 \cdot 5^7}$ to a terminating decimal.
</Question>

<think>
<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to convert the fraction 21 divided by (2 squared times 5 to the 7th power) into a terminating decimal. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. 

First, I remember that a fraction will convert to a terminating decimal if the denominator, after simplifying the fraction, has no prime factors other than 2 or 5. Since the denominator here is already in terms of 2s and 5s, that's a good start. But I need to make sure that the denominator is only composed of 2s and 5s when the fraction is in its simplest form. Wait, the numerator is 21, which factors into 3 and 7. Hmm, so the numerator has primes 3 and 7, but the denominator is 2^2 * 5^7. Since there are no common factors between the numerator and the denominator, the fraction is already in its simplest form. So the denominator is still 2^2 * 5^7.

Now, to convert this into a decimal, I think the method is to adjust the denominator so that it becomes a power of 10, since 10 is 2 * 5. But the denominator here has 2^2 and 5^7. To make it a power of 10, I need to have the same number of 2s and 5s in the denominator. Since there are more 5s than 2s, I should multiply both the numerator and denominator by 2^(7) to balance the exponents.

<prompt_1.1> Calculate the necessary power of 10 for the denominator and adjust the numerator accordingly. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
Wait, let me check that. The denominator has 2^2 and 5^7. If I multiply by 2^5, then the denominator's 2s become 2^(2+5) = 2^7, and the 5s are already 5^7, so then the denominator would be (2^7 * 5^7) = (2*5)^7 = 10^7. That makes sense. So I need to multiply numerator and denominator by 2^5 to get the denominator to 10^7.
</execution_1.1>
</Execution_1>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
So, 21 / (2^2 * 5^7) multiplied by (2^5 / 2^5) becomes (21 * 2^5) / (2^7 * 5^7). Then the denominator is 10^7, which is 10,000,000. The numerator is 21 * 32, since 2^5 is 32. Let me compute that: 21 * 32.

<prompt_2.1> Calculate the new numerator after multiplying by 2^5. </prompt_2.1>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
21 * 30 is 630, and 21 * 2 is 42, so 630 + 42 = 672. So the numerator is 672. Therefore, the fraction becomes 672 / 10,000,000.
</execution_2.1>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Now, converting that to a decimal would be moving the decimal point seven places to the left because the denominator is 10^7. So 672 divided by 10,000,000.

<prompt_3.1> Convert the fraction 672/10,000,000 to a decimal. </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
Let me write 672 as 672.0. Then, dividing by 10^7 moves the decimal point seven places to the left. Starting from the right of 672, which is 672.0, moving the decimal seven places left: first place would be 67.20, then 6.720, then 0.6720, then 0.06720, then 0.006720, then 0.0006720, then 0.00006720. Wait, that seems like moving the decimal seven places, but let me count carefully.

Wait, 672 is 672.0. Let's write it as 672.0. To divide by 10^7, we move the decimal point seven places to the left. Since there are only three digits, we will add zeros as placeholders. Starting from 672.0:

1st place: 67.20
2nd: 6.720
3rd: 0.6720
4th: 0.06720
5th: 0.006720
6th: 0.0006720
7th: 0.00006720

So, 0.0000672. But wait, let me check that. Alternatively, 10^7 is 10,000,000. So 672 divided by 10,000,000 is 672/10,000,000. Let's express this as a decimal. 

Another way: 672 ÷ 10,000,000. Since 10,000,000 has 7 zeros, moving the decimal point in 672.0 seven places to the left gives 0.0000672. Let me verify this by another method.

Alternatively, 1/10,000,000 is 0.0000001, so 672 * 0.0000001 is 0.0000672.

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
Therefore, 21/(2^2*5^7) as a decimal is 0.0000672.

Wait, but let me check if I did everything correctly. Let's step back through the steps again.

<prompt_4.1> Verify the entire process to ensure there are no mistakes. </prompt_4.1>

But let me check with another approach. Let's convert the original fraction to a decimal by adjusting the denominator to a power of 10. The original denominator is 2^2 *5^7. To make this 10^n, we need the exponents of 2 and 5 to be equal. Since 5 has a higher exponent, we take the maximum of 2 and 7, which is 7. So we need to multiply numerator and denominator by 2^(7-2)=2^5=32. Then denominator becomes 2^7 *5^7=10^7=10,000,000. Numerator becomes 21*32=672, so 672/10,000,000=0.0000672.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to write this with exponents. Let's see.

<prompt_4.2> Explore alternative methods to confirm the result. </prompt_4.2>

Another way to think about it: The original fraction is 21/(4*78125) since 2^2 is 4 and 5^7 is 78125. Calculating denominator: 4*78125. Let's compute that.

<prompt_4.3> Calculate the denominator and convert the fraction to a decimal using this method. </prompt_4.3>

Wait, but let me check once more with another approach. Let's express the fraction as 21/(2^2*5^7) and separate the factors of 2 and 5. 

We can write this as 21/(2^2*5^7) = 21/(2^2*5^2*5^5) = 21/(10^2*5^5) = (21/10^2) * (1/5^5). Let's compute 21/100 = 0.21. Then 1/5^5. 5^5 is 3125, so 1/3125. Let's compute 1/3125.

<prompt_4.4> Use this method to confirm the result. </prompt_4.4>

Alternatively, maybe using exponent rules. Let's see.

<prompt_4.5> Explore exponent rules to confirm the result. </prompt_4.5>

Alternatively, breaking down the denominator:

<prompt_4.6> Break down the denominator to confirm the result. </prompt_4.6>

But just to be thorough, let's do the division step by step. Let's compute 21 divided by (2^2*5^7). Let's compute denominator: 2^2=4, 5^7=78125, so 4*78125=312500. So 21 divided by 312500. Let's compute that division.

<prompt_4.7> Perform a long division of 21 by 312500 to confirm the result. </prompt_4.7>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
Original fraction: 21/(2^2 * 5^7). 

Multiply numerator and denominator by 2^5 to get the denominator's 2s to 2^(2+5)=2^7, matching the 5^7. So denominator becomes 2^7 * 5^7 = 10^7. Numerator becomes 21 * 2^5. 2^5 is 32, so 21*32. 21*30=630, 21*2=42, so 630+42=672. So yes, 672/10^7 = 672/10,000,000. 

Dividing 672 by 10,000,000: 10,000,000 goes into 672 zero times. Add decimal point, then 10,000,000 goes into 6720 0. times (since 10,000,000 is larger than 6720). Continue adding zeros: 67200 divided by 10,000,000 is 0.00672... Wait, maybe my earlier method was wrong. Let me do this division step by step.

Wait, 672 divided by 10,000,000. Let's write this as 672 ÷ 10^7. Since 10^7 is 1 followed by 7 zeros, moving the decimal point in 672.0 seven places to the left. So starting from the right of 672:

672.0 → 67.20 (1 place)
67.20 → 6.720 (2 places)
6.720 → 0.6720 (3 places)
0.6720 → 0.06720 (4 places)
0.06720 → 0.006720 (5 places)
0.006720 → 0.0006720 (6 places)
0.0006720 → 0.00006720 (7 places)

So after moving the decimal seven places to the left, it's 0.00006720. However, trailing zeros after the decimal can be omitted, so it's 0.0000672.

<execution_4.2>
Original fraction: 21/(2²*5⁷). 

Multiply numerator and denominator by 5^5 to make the denominator have 5^(7+5) and 2^2*5^5*5^5? Wait, no. Wait, the original denominator is 2^2*5^7. If I multiply numerator and denominator by 2^5, then denominator becomes 2^(2+5)*5^7=2^7*5^7=(2*5)^7=10^7. Yes, that's correct. So numerator is 21*2^5=21*32=672. Therefore, 672/10^7=0.0000672. 

Alternatively, maybe express the original fraction as a decimal by adjusting the denominator. Since the denominator has 5s and 2s, we can multiply numerator and denominator by 5s to make it a power of 10. Wait, but since there are more 5s, perhaps multiplying by 2s to balance. 

Wait, another approach: The number of decimal places will be the maximum of the exponents of 2 and 5 in the denominator after simplifying. Wait, no, actually, the number of decimal places needed is the maximum of the exponents once the denominator is expressed as 10^n. Since we have 10^7, we need 7 decimal places.

4 * 78125. Let's compute 78125 * 4. 78125 * 2 is 156,250, so times 4 is 312,500. So denominator is 312,500. Then 21 divided by 312,500. Let's compute that division. 

21 ÷ 312,500. Let's write this as 21/312500. Let's convert this to a decimal. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 21: Wait, no, maybe better to perform the division directly. 21 divided by 312500. 

Since 312500 is larger than 21, the result will be less than 1. Let's express 21 as 21.000000... 

So 312500 goes into 2100000 (by adding decimal and zeros) how many times? Wait, maybe a better approach is to write this as 21 ÷ 312500 = (21 ÷ 100) ÷ 3125 = 0.21 ÷ 3125. Let's compute 0.21 ÷ 3125. 

3125 goes into 21 zero times. Add decimal point, then 3125 into 210 is 0. 3125 into 2100 is 0. 3125 into 21000. Let's see: 3125 * 6 = 18750, which is less than 21000. 3125*6=18750. Subtract from 21000: 21000 - 18750 = 2250. Bring down the next 0: 22500. 3125*7=21875, which is less than 22500. 22500 - 21875 = 625. Bring down a 0: 6250. 3125*2=6250. So that's 2. So putting it all together: 0.00672. Wait, but this is 0.21 ÷ 3125 = 0.0000672. Wait, no, wait. Let me check this again. 

Wait, 0.21 ÷ 3125. Let me do this step by step. 

First, 3125 goes into 21 zero times. Add decimal point, then 3125 into 210 (hundredths place) is 0. 3125 into 2100 (thousandths place) is still 0. 3125 into 21000 (ten-thousandths place). As before, 3125*6=18750. Subtract from 21000: 2250. Bring down a 0: 22500. 3125*7=21875. Subtract: 22500-21875=625. Bring down a 0: 6250. 3125*2=6250. So now we have 6 (thousandths place), 7 (ten-thousandths), 2 (hundred-thousandths). So 0.00672. But wait, 0.21 ÷ 3125 = 0.0000672? That doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe I messed up the decimal places. 

Wait, 0.21 divided by 3125. Let me write this as 0.21 ÷ 3125. Let's convert 3125 to a fraction: 1/3125. So 0.21 * (1/3125) = 0.21 / 3125. Let's compute 0.21 ÷ 3125. 

Alternatively, 0.21 ÷ 3125 = (0.21 ÷ 5) ÷ 625. Let's compute 0.21 ÷ 5 = 0.042. Then 0.042 ÷ 625. 

0.042 ÷ 625. 625 goes into 42 zero times. 625 into 420 (adding decimal) zero times. 625 into 4200. 625*6=3750. 4200-3750=450. Bring down a 0: 4500. 625*7=4375. 4500-4375=125. Bring down a 0: 1250. 625*2=1250. So that's 6,7,2. So 0.042 ÷ 625 = 0.0000672. Therefore, 0.21 ÷ 3125 = 0.0000672. Therefore, 21 ÷ 312500 = 0.0000672. 

So both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.

1 divided by 3125. Let's compute this. 3125 goes into 1.0000... 0.00032. Wait, 3125 * 32 = 100,000. So 1/3125 = 0.00032. Therefore, 0.21 * 0.00032. Multiplying these two: 0.21 * 0.00032. Let's compute 0.2 * 0.00032 = 0.000064 and 0.01 * 0.00032 = 0.0000032. Adding them together: 0.000064 + 0.0000032 = 0.0000672. So that's the same result as before.

<execution_4.5>
1/5^5 = (1/5)^5 = (0.2)^5. Let's compute that: 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04; 0.04 * 0.2 = 0.008; 0.008 * 0.2 = 0.0016; 0.0016 * 0.2 = 0.00032. Wait, so (1/5)^5 = 1/3125 = 0.00032. Then, 21/100 * 1/3125 = 0.21 * 0.00032. Let's compute 0.21 * 0.00032. 

0.2 * 0.00032 = 0.000064, and 0.01 * 0.00032 = 0.0000032. Adding those together: 0.000064 + 0.0000032 = 0.0000672.
</execution_4.5>

<execution_4.6>
2^2*5^7 = 2^2*5^2*5^5 = (2*5)^2 *5^5 = 10^2*5^5. So 10^2 is 100, 5^5 is 3125. So 100*3125=312500. So 21/312500. 

Now, 21 divided by 312500. Let's write this as 21/312500. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 21: Wait, maybe convert to decimal by moving decimal. Let's write 21 ÷ 312500. 

Alternatively, 312500 goes into 21 how many times? Since 312500 is larger than 21, the result will be less than 1. Let's express this as 21.000000 divided by 312500. 

But perhaps it's easier to write 21/312500 as (21 ÷ 100)/(312500 ÷ 100) = 0.21/3125. Then 0.21 divided by 3125. Hmm, maybe. Let's see.

Alternatively, 21/312500. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 21: 21 ÷21 =1, denominator 312500 ÷21 ≈14881.90476. So 1 divided by 14881.90476, which is approximately 0.0000672. Which matches the previous result.

21 ÷ 312500. Since 312500 is larger than 21, this will be less than 1. Let's write it as 21.000000... 

How many times does 312500 go into 2100000? Let's see:

312500 * 6 = 1,875,000

312500 * 6.72 = ?

Wait, maybe a better way is to perform the division step by step.

Alternatively, 21 ÷ 312500 = (21 ÷ 100) ÷ (312500 ÷ 100) = 0.21 ÷ 3125. Let's compute 0.21 ÷ 3125.

3125 goes into 21 zero times. Add a decimal point and zeros: 21.000000... 

3125 goes into 210006 times (3125*6=18750). Subtract 18750 from 21000: 2250. Bring down next 0: 22500. 3125 goes into 22500 seven times (3125*7=21875). Subtract: 22500-21875=625. Bring down next 0: 6250. 3125 goes into 6250 two times (3125*2=6250). Subtract: 0. So so far, we have 0.0000672. 

So that's 0.0000672. So that's the same result as before. So that checks out.
