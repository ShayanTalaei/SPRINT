<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to solve this functional equation problem. The function f satisfies the equation f(x) + f(y) = f(x + y) - xy - 1 for all real numbers x and y. Also, we know that f(1) = 1. The question is asking for all integers n such that f(n) = n. Hmm, functional equations can be tricky, but let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that functional equations often require finding the general form of the function. Once we have the general form, we can then substitute integer values and check where f(n) = n. So, maybe I should start by trying to find an expression for f(x).

The given equation is f(x) + f(y) = f(x + y) - xy - 1. Let me see if I can manipulate this equation to find a recursive relation or something similar.

Let me try setting y = 1, since we know f(1) = 1. That might help. Let's substitute y = 1 into the equation:

<prompt_1.1> Set \( y = 1 \) in the functional equation and simplify to find a relation involving \( f(x+1) \). </prompt_1.1>
-----

Now, let's verify this with the given condition f(1) = 1. If we plug x=1 into f(x) = (1/2)x² - (1/2)x + 1, let's see:

<prompt_1.2> Verify the derived function \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^2 - \frac{1}{2}x + 1 \) satisfies the given condition \( f(1) = 1 \). </prompt_1.2>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
f(x) + f(1) = f(x + 1) - x*1 - 1

Since f(1) = 1, this simplifies to:

f(x) + 1 = f(x + 1) - x - 1

Let me solve for f(x + 1):

f(x + 1) = f(x) + 1 + x + 1

Simplify that:

f(x + 1) = f(x) + x + 2
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
f(1) = (1/2)(1)^2 - (1/2)(1) + 1 = (1/2 - 1/2 + 1) = 1. That's correct. So the function satisfies the given condition.

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Hmm, so this gives a recursive formula for f(x + 1) in terms of f(x). But x is a real number, not necessarily an integer, so recursion might not be straightforward here. However, since we are interested in integer values n where f(n) = n, maybe we can use this recursive relation to express f(n) in terms of f(0) or f(1), and then solve for n.

Wait, but how do we find f(0)? Let me set x = 0 and y = 0 in the original equation to find f(0):

<prompt_2.1> Find \( f(0) \) by setting \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 0 \) in the functional equation. </prompt_2.1>
-----

Based on execution_1.2:
Now, to find all integers n where f(n) = n, let's set up the equation:

(1/2)n² - (1/2)n + 1 = n

<prompt_2.2> Solve the equation \( \frac{1}{2}n^2 - \frac{1}{2}n + 1 = n \) to find all integers \( n \) where \( f(n) = n \). </prompt_2.2>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
f(0) + f(0) = f(0 + 0) - 0*0 - 1

Simplify:

2f(0) = f(0) - 1

Subtract f(0) from both sides:

f(0) = -1
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Let me solve this equation for n. Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate fractions:

n² - n + 2 = 2n

Bring all terms to one side:

n² - n + 2 - 2n = 0

Combine like terms:

n² - 3n + 2 = 0

Factor the quadratic:

(n - 1)(n - 2) = 0

So, the solutions are n = 1 and n = 2. Therefore, the integers n where f(n) = n are 1 and 2.

Based on execution_2.1:
Great. Now, since we have f(0) = -1 and the recursive relation f(x + 1) = f(x) + x + 2, maybe we can use this to express f(n) for integer n. Let's consider integer values. Let's start by computing f(1), f(2), f(3), etc. , using the recursive formula.

<prompt_3.1> Compute \( f(1) \), \( f(2) \), \( f(3) \), and \( f(4) \) using the recursive relation \( f(x+1) = f(x) + x + 2 \). </prompt_3.1>
-----

Based on execution_2.2:
Wait, but let me double-check this. Let me verify the function f(n) = (1/2)n² - (1/2)n + 1 for n = 1, 2, 3, 4 and see if f(1)=1 and f(2)=2, and then check if the functional equation holds for these values.

<prompt_3.2> Verify the solution by checking if \( f(1) = 1 \), \( f(2) = 2 \), and the functional equation holds for these values. </prompt_3.2>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
We know f(1) = 1. Let's compute f(2):

Using x = 1 in the recursive relation:

f(1 + 1) = f(1) + 1 + 2 => f(2) = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4

Now, f(2) = 4. Let's compute f(3):

f(2 + 1) = f(2) + 2 + 2 => f(3) = 4 + 2 + 2 = 8

f(3) = 8. Then f(4) = f(3) + 3 + 2 = 8 + 3 + 2 = 13

Wait, but let's check if this pattern holds. Let me compute f(4) again to be sure:

f(4) = f(3) + 3 + 2 = 8 + 5 = 13. Yes, same result.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
First, f(1) = (1/2)(1) - (1/2)(1) + 1 = (1/2 - 1/2 + 1) = 1. Correct.

f(2) = (1/2)(4) - (1/2)(2) + 1 = 2 - 1 + 1 = 2. Correct.

f(3) = (1/2)(9) - (1/2)(3) + 1 = 4.5 - 1.5 + 1 = 4. So f(3)=4.

f(4) = (1/2)(16) - (1/2)(4) + 1 = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7. So f(4)=7.

Hmm, so f(1)=1, f(2)=2, but f(3)=4, f(4)=7. So only 1 and 2 satisfy f(n)=n. Let's check if there are any others.

Wait, but maybe negative integers? Let's check n=0. f(0)=-1, which is not equal to 0. n=-1: f(-1)=(1/2)(1) - (1/2)(-1) +1= 0.5 +0.5 +1=2. So f(-1)=2, which is not equal to -1. Similarly, n=-2: f(-2)=(1/2)(4) - (1/2)(-2) +1=2 +1 +1=4. So f(-2)=4≠-2. So no negative integers satisfy f(n)=n.

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
But this is only for integer values. However, the recursive relation f(x + 1) = f(x) + x + 2 holds for all real x. If we can find the general solution for f(x), maybe we can confirm whether our initial assumption is correct.

Let me try to find the general form of f(x). The functional equation resembles Cauchy's functional equation, but with additional terms. Let's see if we can transform it into a more familiar form.

<prompt_4.1> Find the general solution for \( f(x) \) by transforming the functional equation into a more familiar form. </prompt_4.1>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
First, let's rearrange the given equation:

f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) + xy + 1

This looks similar to the Cauchy equation f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y), but with extra terms. Maybe we can find a function g(x) such that f(x) = g(x) + something, to eliminate the extra terms.

Let me assume that f(x) can be written as a quadratic function plus some linear term. Let's suppose f(x) = ax² + bx + c. Let's substitute this into the functional equation and see if we can find coefficients a, b, c that satisfy the equation.

Compute f(x) + f(y):

ax² + bx + c + ay² + by + c = a(x² + y²) + b(x + y) + 2c

Compute f(x + y):

a(x + y)² + b(x + y) + c = a(x² + 2xy + y²) + b(x + y) + c

Now, according to the functional equation:

f(x) + f(y) = f(x + y) - xy - 1

So substitute the expressions:

a(x² + y²) + b(x + y) + 2c = a(x² + 2xy + y²) + b(x + y) + c - xy - 1

Simplify the right-hand side:

a(x² + 2xy + y²) + b(x + y) + c - xy - 1 = a(x² + y²) + 2a xy + b(x + y) + c - xy - 1

Now, set the left-hand side equal to the right-hand side:

a(x² + y²) + b(x + y) + 2c = a(x² + y²) + 2a xy + b(x + y) + c - xy - 1

Subtract a(x² + y²) + b(x + y) from both sides:

2c = 2a xy + c - xy - 1

Simplify:

2c - c = (2a xy - xy) - 1

c = (2a - 1)xy - 1

But this must hold for all x and y, which implies that the coefficient of xy must be zero, and the constant term must equal c. So:

Coefficient of xy: 2a - 1 = 0 => 2a = 1 => a = 1/2

Constant term: c = -1

Therefore, a = 1/2, c = -1. Then, the coefficient b is still unknown? Wait, in the equation above, after substituting, the terms involving x and y canceled out except for the constants and the xy term. So the coefficient b can be any value? But wait, in the original substitution, the linear terms b(x + y) on both sides canceled out. So that suggests that b can be arbitrary? But we have the condition f(1) = 1, so maybe that determines b.

Wait, let's check. So our quadratic function is f(x) = (1/2)x² + bx - 1. Now, apply the condition f(1) = 1:

f(1) = (1/2)(1) + b(1) - 1 = 1/2 + b - 1 = b - 1/2 = 1

So, solving for b:

b - 1/2 = 1 => b = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2

Therefore, the function is f(x) = (1/2)x² + (3/2)x - 1. Let's write that as:

f(x) = (1/2)x² + (3/2)x - 1

Alternatively, factor out 1/2:

f(x) = (1/2)(x² + 3x) - 1

But let's check if this function satisfies the original functional equation. Let me verify with x = 1 and y = 1:

Left-hand side: f(1) + f(1) = 1 + 1 = 2

Right-hand side: f(1 + 1) - (1)(1) - 1 = f(2) - 1 - 1 = 4 - 2 = 2. Correct.

Another test: x = 2, y = 3

Left-hand side: f(2) + f(3) = 4 + 8 = 12

Right-hand side: f(5) - (2)(3) -1 = f(5) -6 -1 = f(5) -7

Compute f(5): (1/2)(25) + (3/2)(5) -1 = 12.5 + 7.5 -1 = 19

So, 19 -7 =12. Which matches the left-hand side. So the functional equation holds.

f(n) = n. So set (1/2)n² + (3/2)n -1 = n

Multiply both sides by 2:

n² + 3n - 2 = 2n

Bring all terms to left:

n² + 3n - 2 - 2n = 0 => n² + n - 2 = 0

Factor:

(n + 2)(n - 1) = 0

Solutions n = -2 and n = 1. Wait, but earlier when I computed using the recursive relation, I found f(1)=1, f(2)=4, f(3)=8, etc. , and when solving the quadratic equation, I got n=1 and n=2. Now, there's a discrepancy here. The quadratic equation suggests n=-2 and n=1. But when I computed f(-2) earlier, I got 4, which is not equal to -2. So, what's going on here?

Wait, there must be a mistake in my calculations. Let me check the general form of f(x). Wait, when I assumed f(x) is quadratic, f(x) = ax² + bx + c, and found a=1/2, c=-1, and then found b=3/2. Then f(x) = (1/2)x² + (3/2)x -1. Let's verify f(1):

(1/2)(1) + (3/2)(1) -1 = 0.5 + 1.5 -1 = 2 -1 =1. Correct. f(0) = 0 +0 -1 = -1. Correct. Then f(2) = (1/2)(4) + (3/2)(2) -1 = 2 +3 -1=4. Correct. f(3)= (1/2)(9) + (3/2)(3) -1=4.5 +4.5 -1=8. Correct. So that's correct.

But when solving the equation f(n)=n, we have (1/2)n² + (3/2)n -1 =n. Multiply by 2: n² +3n -2=2n =>n² +n -2=0. Which factors to (n+2)(n-1)=0. So n=1 or n=-2. But when I computed f(-2), I got 4. Let's check again:

f(-2) = (1/2)(4) + (3/2)(-2) -1 = 2 -3 -1 = -2. Wait, that's -2. But earlier I thought f(-2)=4. Wait, maybe I miscalculated earlier.

Wait, let me compute f(-2) again:

f(-2) = (1/2)*(-2)^2 + (3/2)*(-2) -1

= (1/2)(4) + (3/2)(-2) -1

= 2 - 3 -1

= (2 -3) -1

= (-1) -1 = -2.

Wait, so f(-2) = -2. But earlier, when I thought I calculated f(-2)=4, that was my mistake. So actually, f(-2)=-2. So n=-2 is a solution. But earlier, when I computed using the recursive formula, I only computed up to f(4), but if we use the general formula, f(-2)=-2. So that's another solution.

But how come when I used the recursive formula, starting from f(0)=-1, and using f(x+1)=f(x)+x+2, I can't get negative integers? Because the recursive formula f(x+1)=f(x)+x+2 is for increasing x, but if we want to go to negative x, we need a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the function is defined for all real numbers, but the problem is only concerned with integer n. So maybe even though f(x) is defined for all real x, the relation f(x +1)=f(x)+x+2 holds for all real x. So if we consider x being an integer, then we can use this recursive relation to compute f(n) for integer n. But if x is not an integer, we can't directly use the recursion. However, since we have the general formula for f(x), which is valid for all real x, we can just plug in integer values.

So, according to the general formula, f(n)= (1/2)n² + (3/2)n -1. Setting this equal to n gives:

(1/2)n² + (3/2)n -1 = n

Multiply both sides by 2:

n² + 3n - 2 = 2n

Bring all terms to left:

n² + n - 2 = 0

Factor:

(n + 2)(n - 1) = 0

Solutions n = -2 and n = 1. Therefore, both n = -2 and n = 1 are integers where f(n) = n. But earlier, when I computed f(-2) using the general formula, it was -2, which satisfies f(n)=n. However, when I computed f(-1), f(-1)= (1/2)(1) + (3/2)(-1) -1 = 0.5 -1.5 -1 = -2. So f(-1)=-2≠-1. Similarly, f(0)=-1, f(1)=1, f(2)=4, f(3)=8, etc.

Therefore, the solutions are n=-2 and n=1. But the problem states "find all integers n such that f(n)=n". So both -2 and 1 are solutions.

Based on execution_5.1:
Wait, but in my initial computation when I used the recursive relation for positive integers, starting from f(1)=1, I got f(2)=4, f(3)=8, etc. , but according to the general formula, f(2)=4, which matches, f(3)= (1/2)(9) + (3/2)(3) -1 = 4.5 +4.5 -1=8, which matches. So f(3)=8. Then f(4)= (1/2)(16)+(3/2)(4)-1=8 +6 -1=13. Which also matches the earlier calculation. So f(4)=13. So for positive integers, only n=1 satisfies f(n)=n. For negative integers, let's check n=-2: f(-2)=-2, so that works. n=-1: f(-1)= (1/2)(1) + (3/2)(-1) -1=0.5 -1.5 -1= -2, which is not equal to -1. So only n=-2 and n=1.

But wait, let's check if there are any other integer solutions. For example, n=2: f(2)=4≠2. n=3:8≠3. n=4:13≠4. So no. For negative integers beyond -2, let's check n=-3:

f(-3)= (1/2)(9) + (3/2)(-3) -1=4.5 -4.5 -1= -1. So f(-3)=-1. Which is not equal to -3. Similarly, n=-4:

f(-4)= (1/2)(16) + (3/2)(-4) -1=8 -6 -1=1. So f(-4)=1≠-4. So no. So only n=-2 and n=1.

But wait, the problem says "find all integers n such that f(n)=n". So according to our calculations, the solutions are n=-2 and n=1.

Based on execution_6.1:
But let me verify again with the general formula. The general formula is f(n)= (1/2)n² + (3/2)n -1. Let's set this equal to n:

(1/2)n² + (3/2)n -1 =n

Multiply by 2:

n² +3n -2=2n

n² +n -2=0

Solutions:

n = [-1 ± sqrt(1 +8)]/2 = [-1 ±3]/2

Thus, n=(-1+3)/2=1, n=(-1-3)/2=-2. So yes, n=1 and n=-2. Therefore, the integers are -2 and 1.

But wait, earlier when I computed f(-2) using the general formula, I got -2, which is correct. So that's a solution. But why didn't the recursive approach reveal this? Because the recursive approach f(x+1)=f(x)+x+2 is valid for all real x, but if we start from x=1 and go to higher integers, we can't go to negative integers using that recursion. So to find f(-2), we need another approach. Alternatively, since we have the general formula, we can just plug in.

Therefore, the answer should be n=-2 and n=1. But let me check if the problem specifies that n is a positive integer or any integer. The problem says "all integers n", so negative integers are included. Therefore, both -2 and 1 are solutions.

Then f(-2) + f(2) = (-2) +4=2

f(-2 +2)=f(0)=-1. So according to the equation:

f(0) should be equal to f(-2) + f(2) - (-2)(2) -1

So f(0) = (-2) +4 - (-4) -1 = (-2 +4) +4 -1=2 +4 -1=5. But f(0) is given as -1. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, this suggests a contradiction.

Wait, that can't be. If we use x=-2 and y=2, then according to the functional equation:

f(-2) + f(2) = f(0) - (-2)(2) -1

So:

f(-2) + f(2) = f(0) +4 -1 => f(-2) + f(2) = f(0) +3

But if f(-2)=-2, f(2)=4, then left-hand side is -2 +4=2. The right-hand side is f(0) +3=-1 +3=2. So 2=2. Correct. So that works. So my previous calculation was incorrect. Let me check again:

f(-2) + f(2) = (-2) +4=2

f(0) +3= -1 +3=2. Correct. So that's okay. So the functional equation holds. So my mistake earlier was miscalculating the right-hand side. So that's okay.

Therefore, everything checks out. The function f(n) = (1/2)n² + (3/2)n -1 satisfies the functional equation and the condition f(1)=1. The integers n where f(n)=n are n=-2 and n=1.
