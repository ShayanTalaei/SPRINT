<Question>
A Senate committee has 5 Democrats, 5 Republicans, and 1 Independent.  In how many ways can they sit around a circular table if all the members of each party all sit next to each other?  (Two seatings are considered equivalent if one is a rotation of the other.)

Okay, so I need to figure out how many ways the Senate committee can sit around a circular table with the condition that all members of each party sit next to each other. The Senate committee has 5 Democrats, 5 Republicans, and 1 Independent. Hmm, let me start breaking this down.

<prompt_1.1> Identify the key elements of the problem and the condition that all members of each party must sit next to each other. </prompt_1.1>

<execution_1.1>
First, there's a circular table, so rotational arrangements are considered the same. That usually means we fix one person's position to avoid counting rotations multiple times. But here, there's an added condition: all members of each party must sit next to each other. So, the Democrats form a block, Republicans form another block, and the Independent is just a single person, so that's a block of one. So, essentially, there are three blocks: D, R, and I. The problem then becomes arranging these three blocks around the circular table, and then arranging the individuals within each block.

Wait, but since it's a circular table, arranging three blocks around it... Normally, for linear arrangements, the number of permutations of three blocks would be 3! , but for circular arrangements, it's (3-1)! because rotations are considered the same. So, that would be 2! = 2 ways to arrange the blocks around the table. But let me confirm that. If we fix one block's position due to the circular nature, then the other two blocks can be arranged in 2! ways relative to the first block.

Based on execution_1.1:
So, that gives 2 possible arrangements for the blocks.

But then, within each block, the individuals can be arranged among themselves. For the Democrats, there are 5 members, so they can be arranged in 5!
ways. Similarly, Republicans can be arranged in 5! ways. The Independent is just one person, so there's only 1 way to arrange them.

So, combining these, the total number of arrangements should be the number of ways to arrange the blocks (which is 2) multiplied by the number of ways to arrange the people within each block (5! for Democrats, 5! for Republicans, and 1! for the Independent). So, total arrangements = 2 * 5! * 5! * 1!

But wait, hold on. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The key here is that each party must all sit next to each other, so the blocks have to be contiguous.

<prompt_2.1> Verify the calculation of the total number of arrangements by considering the fixed position of blocks and the arrangement within each block. </prompt_2.1>

But let me double-check. Let's think of the blocks as three units: D, R, I. In circular permutations, the number of ways to arrange n distinct objects is (n-1)! .

<prompt_2.2> Re-evaluate the calculation of the total number of arrangements using the formula for circular permutations of distinct objects. </prompt_2.2>

But let me think again. Is there any possibility that the blocks could be arranged in a different way? For example, if the Independent was considered a block of one, but since there's only one person, does that affect anything?

<prompt_2.3> Consider the effect of having a block with a single member (the Independent) on the arrangement. </prompt_2.3>

But wait, another thought: when we fix the position of the blocks, does the order matter? For example, if we fix the Democrat block at a certain position, then the Republican and Independent can be arranged in two ways: Republican next to Democrat and Independent next, or Independent next to Democrat and Republican next.
But since it's a circular table, once we fix one block, the others are relative. So, yes, fixing one block, the other two can be arranged in 2 ways.

Alternatively, if we don't fix any block, the number of circular arrangements for three blocks is (3-1)! = 2, which is the same as before. So, that's consistent.

Alternatively, if we think of linear arrangements, which would be 3! = 6, but since it's circular, we divide by 3 (the number of rotations), so 6/3 = 2.
So that's the same as before.

Therefore, the total number of arrangements is 2 * 5! * 5! * 1!
= 2 * 120 * 120 * 1 = 2 * 14400 = 28,800.

But let me check if there's another way to approach this problem.

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
So, since the table is circular, the blocks have to be placed such that each block is adjacent to the other blocks. Since there are three blocks, they form three consecutive seats each. So, the problem is similar to arranging three groups around a circular table where each group must stay together. 

In that case, the formula I remember is that for circular arrangements with groups, you fix one group's position to eliminate rotational symmetry, then arrange the remaining groups relative to it. So, fixing the Democrat block's position, for example, then the Republican and Independent blocks can be arranged in 2! ways (since there are two blocks left). Then, within each block, you arrange the people. So, that would be 2! * 5! * 5! * 1! . Which is the same as before. So, 2 * 120 * 120 * 1 = 28,800.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
So, for three blocks, it's (3-1)! = 2! = 2. That's correct. So, the blocks can be arranged in 2 ways.

Then, within each block, the individuals can be arranged. For Democrats, 5! , Republicans 5! , and Independent 1! . So, multiplying all these together: 2 * 5! * 5! * 1! = 2 * 120 * 120 * 1 = 28,800.
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
Since the Independent is a single person, their block is just one seat. So, when arranging the blocks, we have three blocks: D (5 people), R (5 people), I (1 person). So, arranging three blocks around a circular table. So, the formula would be (3-1)! = 2! for the blocks, and then multiply by the permutations within each block. So, yes, that seems right.

Alternatively, if we think of the blocks as distinct, then their arrangement would indeed be (3-1)! .
</execution_2.3>

<execution_2.4>
Alternatively, think of the table as having three consecutive blocks. Since all Democrats must sit together, Republicans must sit together, and the Independent is alone. So, first, arrange the blocks. Then, within each block, arrange the members.

But the key is that in circular arrangements, the number of ways to arrange the blocks is (number of blocks -1 )! So, 2! for three blocks. Then, within each block, the permutations.

Yes, so that gives 2! * 5! *5! *1! = 2*120*120=28,800.
</execution_2.4>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.4:
Therefore, after considering different approaches and verifying the calculations, I believe the answer is 28,800 ways.

**Final Answer**
The number of ways is \boxed{28800}.
