Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. The question is asking: For how many positive integers \( n > 1 \) is it true that \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect \( n^{\text{th}} \) power? Hmm, so I need to find all integers \( n \) greater than 1 such that \( 2^{24} \) can be written as some integer raised to the \( n^{\text{th}} \) power.

Let me restate the problem to make sure I understand it. We need to find the number of integers \( n > 1 \) for which there exists an integer \( k \) such that \( k^n = 2^{24} \).
</execution_1.1>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
First, let's recall that a perfect \( n^{\text{th}} \) power means that the number can be expressed as another number raised to the exponent \( n \). So, if \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect \( n^{\text{th}} \) power, then there must be some integer \( k \) where \( k^n = 2^{24} \).

Since \( 2^{24} \) is already a power of 2, maybe \( k \) should also be a power of 2?

Let me test this idea.

<prompt_2.1> Test the idea that \( k \) should be a power of 2 by considering specific values of \( n \). </prompt_2.1>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Suppose \( k = 2^m \) for some integer \( m \). Then substituting into the equation \( k^n = 2^{24} \), we get \( (2^m)^n = 2^{24} \). Simplifying the left side, that's \( 2^{m \cdot n} = 2^{24} \). Since the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal. Therefore, \( m \cdot n = 24 \).

So, this equation tells us that \( n \) must be a divisor of 24. But wait, \( n \) has to be greater than 1, so we need to find all divisors of 24 that are greater than 1.

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Let me list the divisors of 24.

<prompt_3.1> List the divisors of 24 and identify those greater than 1. </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
Starting with 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. But since \( n > 1 \), we exclude 1. So the possible values for \( n \) are 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. That gives us 7 values.
</execution_3.1>
</Execution_3>

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
Wait a second, let me check if this is correct.

<prompt_4.1> Verify the solution by checking if each identified \( n \) satisfies the condition. </prompt_4.1>

But hold on, is there any other possible \( n \) that isn't a divisor of 24 but still makes \( 2^{24} \) a perfect \( n^{\text{th}} \) power? Let me think. Suppose there exists an \( n \) that isn't a divisor of 24, but \( 2^{24} \) is still a perfect \( n^{\text{th}} \) power.
That would mean that \( 24 \) is a multiple of \( n \), right? Wait, no. Let me clarify. If \( k^n = 2^{24} \), then \( k \) must be \( 2^{24/n} \). Therefore, \( 24/n \) must be an integer because the exponent of 2 must be an integer.

<prompt_4.2> Further verify if non-divisors of 24 can satisfy the condition. </prompt_4.2>

Therefore, the number of positive integers \( n > 1 \) is equal to the number of positive divisors of 24 minus 1 (for excluding 1).
Since 24 has prime factorization \( 2^3 \times 3^1 \), the number of divisors is (3+1)(1+1) = 4Ã—2=8.

<prompt_4.3> Calculate the number of divisors of 24 and adjust for \( n > 1 \). </prompt_4.3>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
For each of these \( n \), does \( 2^{24} \) being a perfect \( n^{\text{th}} \) power hold true?

Take \( n = 2 \): \( 2^{24} = (2^{12})^2 \), which is \( 4096^2 \), so that works.

\( n = 3 \): \( 2^{24} = (2^8)^3 = 256^3 \), correct.

\( n = 4 \): \( 2^{24} = (2^6)^4 = 64^4 \), yes.

\( n = 6 \): \( 2^{24} = (2^4)^6 = 16^6 \), right.

\( n = 8 \): \( 2^{24} = (2^3)^8 = 8^8 \), that's true.

\( n = 12 \): \( 2^{24} = (2^2)^{12} = 4^{12} \), correct.

\( n = 24 \): \( 2^{24} = 2^{24} = (2^1)^{24} \), which is just 2 raised to the 24th power, so that's also a perfect 24th power.
</execution_4.1>

<execution_4.2>
So \( n \) must divide 24. Therefore, only the divisors of 24 are possible. So my initial thought was correct.

So, since 24 has divisors 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, and we exclude 1, there are 7 values.
</execution_4.2>

<execution_4.3>
So there are 8 divisors, as listed earlier. Excluding 1, that's 7. So the answer should be 7.

But let me test with an example. Let's take \( n = 2 \). Then \( 2^{24} = (2^{12})^2 \), which is \( 4096^2 \), so that works. For \( n = 3 \), \( 2^{24} = (2^8)^3 = 256^3 \). That's correct. For \( n = 4 \), \( (2^6)^4 = 64^4 \), which is \( 2^{24} \). Okay, that's good. How about \( n = 6 \)? \( 2^{24} = (2^4)^6 = 16^6 \). Yep, that's right. \( n = 8 \): \( 2^{24} = (2^3)^8 = 8^8 \). Correct. \( n = 12 \): \( (2^2)^{12} = 4^{12} \). And \( n = 24 \): \( 2^1^{24} = 2^{24} \). All of these check out.

<Plan_5>
Based on execution_4.3:
Therefore, the number of positive integers \( n > 1 \) is 7. So, the answer is 7.

<prompt_5.1> Provide the final answer and reflect on the solution process. </prompt_5.1>
</Plan_5>

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
But let me just confirm once more. The problem says "perfect nth power". So, for each divisor \( n \) of 24 greater than 1, \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect nth power. Since \( 24/n \) is an integer, then \( 2^{24} = (2^{24/n})^n \). Therefore, \( k = 2^{24/n} \), which is an integer, so yes, this works. Therefore, all such \( n \) are exactly the divisors of 24 greater than 1, which are 7 in number.

Therefore, the answer is 7.

**Final Answer**
The number of positive integers \( n > 1 \) is \boxed{7}.
</execution_5.1>
</Execution_5>

<Final_answer>
Therefore, combining the results from both cases, the total number of positive integers $n > 1$ for which $2^{24}$ is a perfect $n^{\text{th}}$ power is $\boxed{7}$.
