Let $F(z)=\frac{z+i}{z-i}$ for all complex numbers $z\not= i,$ and let $z_n=F(z_{n-1})$ for all positive integers $n.$ Given that $z_0=\frac 1{137}+i,$ find $z_{2002}.$
</Question>

<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to find z_{2002} given that z_n = F(z_{n-1}) where F(z) = (z + i)/(z - i) and z_0 = 1/137 + i. Hmm, let's start by understanding what this function F does. It's a Möbius transformation, right? These transformations have interesting properties, especially when iterated. Maybe there's a cycle or some periodicity here?

First, let me write down the function again: F(z) = (z + i)/(z - i). Let's see what happens if I apply F repeatedly. Maybe compute the first few terms to see if there's a pattern.

Given z_0 = 1/137 + i. Let's compute z_1 = F(z_0).

<prompt_1.1> Compute z_1 = F(z_0) using the function F(z) = (z + i)/(z - i) and z_0 = 1/137 + i. </prompt_1.1>

Now z_1 = i. Let's compute z_2 = F(z_1). But z_1 is i, so F(i) = (i + i)/(i - i) = (2i)/0. Oh, division by zero. That's undefined. But the problem states z ≠ i, so maybe z_1 isn't allowed to be i?
Wait, but z_1 is i, which is excluded from the domain of F. Hmm, that's a problem. But the problem says z_n = F(z_{n-1}) for all positive integers n. So starting from z_0, which is 1/137 + i, then z_1 is F(z_0), which is ( (1/137 + i) + i ) / ( (1/137 + i) - i ) = (1/137 + 2i)/(1/137).

<prompt_1.2> Analyze the domain of F and confirm z_1 = i is excluded. </prompt_1.2>

Wait, but let me check again. Let me compute z_1 again step by step to ensure I didn't make a mistake.

<prompt_1.3> Recompute z_1 step by step to ensure accuracy. </prompt_1.3>

But let me check with another approach. Maybe representing the transformation as a matrix.

<execution_1.1>
So substituting z_0 into F:

Numerator: (1/137 + i) + i = 1/137 + 2i.

Denominator: (1/137 + i) - i = 1/137.

So F(z_0) = (1/137 + 2i)/(1/137) = (1 + 274i)/1 = 1 + 274i. Wait, 2i divided by 1/137 is 2i * 137 = 274i. So z_1 = 1 + 274i.
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
Let's compute that. The numerator is 1/137 + 2i, denominator is 1/137. So dividing term by term: (1/137)/(1/137) + (2i)/(1/137) = 1 + 2i * 137 = 1 + 274i. So z_1 = 1 + 274i.
</execution_1.2>

<execution_1.3>
F(z_0) = (z_0 + i)/(z_0 - i) = ( (1/137 + i) + i ) / ( (1/137 + i) - i ) = numerator: 1/137 + 2i, denominator: 1/137. So dividing these gives (1/137 + 2i) * (137/1) = 1 + 268i.
</execution_1.3>

<execution_1.4>
Möbius transformations can be represented by matrices, and composition corresponds to matrix multiplication. The transformation F(z) = (az + b)/(cz + d) corresponds to the matrix [[a, b], [c, d]]. So here, F(z) = (z + i)/(z - i) corresponds to the matrix [[1, i], [1, -i]]. Let's call this matrix M.

Then, iterating the transformation corresponds to taking powers of the matrix M. So, z_n corresponds to M^n applied to z_0. But matrices can be tricky because they depend on the representative; scalar multiples give the same transformation. However, eigenvalues and eigenvectors might help here.

Let's compute the eigenvalues of M. The characteristic equation is det(M - λI) = 0. So:

|1 - λ    i     |
|1      -i - λ |  = (1 - λ)(-i - λ) - i*1 = (-i - λ + iλ + λ²) - i = λ² - iλ - i - λ + iλ + λ²? Wait, maybe I need to compute it more carefully.

Wait, determinant is (1 - λ)(-i - λ) - (i)(1) = (-i - λ + iλ + λ²) - i = λ² + (-i -1 + iλ) + (-i). Wait, this seems messy.

Alternatively, let's compute it step by step:

(1 - λ)(-i - λ) = (1)(-i) + (1)(-λ) - λ(-i) - λ(λ) = -i - λ + iλ - λ².

Then subtract i*1: so total determinant is (-i - λ + iλ - λ²) - i = -i - λ + iλ - λ² - i = -λ² - λ + iλ - 2i.

Set equal to zero: -λ² - λ + iλ - 2i = 0. Multiply both sides by -1: λ² + λ - iλ + 2i = 0. So λ² + (1 - i)λ + 2i = 0.

Solve quadratic equation: λ = [ -(1 - i) ± sqrt( (1 - i)^2 - 8i ) ] / 2.

Compute discriminant D = (1 - i)^2 - 8i. First, (1 - i)^2 = 1 - 2i + i² = 1 - 2i -1 = -2i. Then D = -2i -8i = -10i.

So sqrt(D) = sqrt(-10i). Hmm, need to compute square roots of -10i. Let me recall that sqrt(-10i) can be expressed as a complex number. Let’s write -10i in polar form.

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Now z_2 = F(z_1). Let's compute that.
F(i) = (i + i)/(i - i) = 2i/0, which is undefined. So z_2 is undefined? But according to the problem statement, z_n is defined for all n, so maybe there's a mistake here?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing z_1. Let me check again.

<prompt_2.1> Re-evaluate the computation of z_1 and confirm the result. </prompt_2.1>
-----

Based on execution_1.3:
Then z_2 = F(z_1) = ( (1 + 268i) + i ) / ( (1 + 268i) - i ) = (1 + 269i)/(1 + 266i).

<prompt_2.2> Confirm z_2 by recomputing and simplifying the expression. </prompt_2.2>
-----

Based on execution_1.4:
The modulus is sqrt( (-10)^2 + 0^2 ) = 10, argument is -π/2 (since it's on the negative imaginary axis). So -10i = 10e^{-iπ/2}. Then sqrt(-10i) = sqrt(10)e^{-iπ/4} = sqrt(10)(cos(-π/4) + i sin(-π/4)) = sqrt(10)(√2/2 - i√2/2) = sqrt(5) - i sqrt(5). Alternatively, the other root would be -sqrt(5) + i sqrt(5).

So sqrt(D) = ±(sqrt(5) - i sqrt(5)). Let's take the principal root, which would be sqrt(10)e^{-iπ/4} = sqrt(5) - i sqrt(5).

Therefore, λ = [ -(1 - i) ± (sqrt(5) - i sqrt(5)) ] / 2.

Let me compute both roots:

<execution_2.1>
Wait, z_0 is 1/137 + i. Then z_1 = F(z_0) = (z_0 + i)/(z_0 - i). Let's compute numerator and denominator again:

Numerator: z_0 + i = (1/137 + i) + i = 1/137 + 2i.

Denominator: z_0 - i = (1/137 + i) - i = 1/137. So yes, z_1 = (1/137 + 2i)/(1/137) = 1 + 274i. Wait, 2i divided by 1/137 is 2i * 137 = 274i. So numerator is 1 + 274i.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Wait, 268i + i is 269i, and denominator is 1 + 266i. To simplify, multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:

(1 + 269i)(1 - 266i) / [ (1 + 266i)(1 - 266i) ].

Denominator: 1^2 - (266i)^2 = 1 - (266^2)(i^2) = 1 - (69636)(-1) = 1 + 69636 = 69637.

Numerator: 1*1 + 1*(-266i) + 269i*1 + 269i*(-266i) = 1 - 266i + 269i - 269*266 i^2.

Simplify numerator:

1 + ( -266i + 269i ) + ( -269*266 i^2 ).

Which is 1 + 3i + ( -269*266*(-1) ) since i^2 = -1.

So 1 + 3i + 269*266.

Compute 269*266. Let's calculate:

200*266 = 53,200

60*266 = 15,960

9*266 = 2,394

Adding these: 53,200 + 15,960 = 69,160; 69,160 + 2,394 = 71,554.

So numerator is 1 + 3i + 71,554 = 71,555 + 3i.

Therefore, z_2 = (71,555 + 3i)/69,637. Let me divide both terms:

71,555 / 69,637 ≈ 1.027... Hmm, but let's see if this simplifies. Let me check if 71,555 and 69,637 have a common factor.

Compute 71,555 - 69,637 = 1,918. Then check GCD(69,637, 1,918). Let's divide 69,637 by 1,918:

1,918*36 = 69,048. 69,637 - 69,048 = 589. Then GCD(1,918, 589). 1,918 ÷ 589 = 3 with remainder 1,918 - 3*589 = 1,918 - 1,767 = 151. Then GCD(589,151). 589 ÷ 151 = 3, remainder 136. Then GCD(151,136). 151 - 136 = 15. GCD(136,15). 136 ÷15=9, remainder 1. GCD(15,1)=1. So no common factors. Therefore, z_2 = (71555 + 3i)/69637.

First root with plus sign:

- (1 - i) + sqrt(5) - i sqrt(5) = (-1 + sqrt(5)) + i( -1 - sqrt(5) )

Second root with minus sign:

- (1 - i) - sqrt(5) + i sqrt(5) = (-1 - sqrt(5)) + i(1 + sqrt(5))

Divided by 2: [ (-1 - sqrt(5)) + i(1 + sqrt(5)) ] / 2.

Hmm, these eigenvalues look complicated. Maybe this approach isn't the most efficient.

But then z_2 = F(z_1) = F(i). But F(i) is (i + i)/(i - i) = 2i/0, which is undefined. That's a problem. But the problem states that z_n is defined for all positive integers n. Did I make a mistake here?

Wait, maybe I miscalculated z_1. Let me check z_0 again.

z_0 is given as 1/137 + i. So z_0 is a complex number with real part 1/137 and imaginary part 1. Then z_1 = F(z_0) = (z_0 + i)/(z_0 - i). Let's compute numerator and denominator again:

Numerator: z_0 + i = (1/137 + i) + i = 1/137 + 2i.

Denominator: z_0 - i = (1/137 + i) - i = 1/137.

Therefore, z_1 = (1/137 + 2i)/(1/137) = (1 + 274i)/1 = 1 + 274i.

Alternatively, perhaps we can represent complex numbers as points on the Riemann sphere or use inversion, but that might be overcomplicating.

Alternatively, note that F(z) = (z + i)/(z - i). Let's write this as F(z) = 1 - (2i)/(z - i). Hmm, maybe that's useful? Not sure.

Alternatively, consider that Möbius transformations can have periodic points. Let's see if F has finite order, i.e., F^k(z) = z for some k. If that's the case, then the transformation is periodic with period k, and we can use that to find z_{2002}.

So let's check if F composed with itself gives the identity or some other transformation.

Compute F(F(z)):

Let me compute F(F(z)):

F(z) = (z + i)/(z - i).

So F(F(z)) = F( (z + i)/(z - i) ) = [ ( (z + i)/(z - i) ) + i ] / [ ( (z + i)/(z - i) ) - i ].

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: [ (z + i) + i(z - i) ] / (z - i) = [ z + i + i z - i^2 ] / (z - i) = [ z + i + i z + 1 ] / (z - i ) = [ z + 1 + i z + i ] / (z - i ) = [ z(1 + i) + i(1 + 1) ] Wait, let's factor:

Wait, z + i z = z(1 + i), and i + 1 = 1 + i. Wait, no:

Wait, numerator after expanding:

z + i + i z - i^2 = z + i z + i + 1 (since i^2 = -1, so -i^2 = 1). So z(1 + i) + (i + 1). So factor (1 + i):

(1 + i)(z + 1). Therefore, numerator is (1 + i)(z + 1)/(z - i).

Denominator: [ (z + i) - i(z - i) ] / (z - i) = [ z + i - i z + i^2 ] / (z - i ) = [ z + i - i z - 1 ] / (z - i ) = [ z - i z + i - 1 ] = z(1 - i) + (i - 1). Factor (1 - i):

(1 - i)(z) + (i - 1) = (1 - i)z - (1 - i) = (1 - i)(z - 1). Therefore, denominator is (1 - i)(z - 1)/(z - i).

Therefore, F(F(z)) = [ (1 + i)(z + 1)/(z - i) ] / [ (1 - i)(z - 1)/(z - i) ] = [ (1 + i)(z + 1) ] / [ (1 - i)(z - 1) ].

Simplify the constants: (1 + i)/(1 - i) = [ (1 + i)^2 ] / [ (1 - i)(1 + i) ] = (1 + 2i + i²)/(1 - i²) = (1 + 2i -1)/(1 - (-1)) = (2i)/2 = i. Therefore, (1 + i)/(1 - i) = i.

Therefore, F(F(z)) = i(z + 1)/(z - 1).

Hmm, so F^2(z) = i(z + 1)/(z - 1). Let's compute F^3(z) = F(F^2(z)).
</execution_3.2>

<execution_3.3>
Wait, the discriminant was D = -10i. Then sqrt(-10i) was calculated as sqrt(10)e^{-iπ/4} = sqrt(5) - i sqrt(5). Let me verify that. If we square sqrt(5) - i sqrt(5), we get (sqrt(5))^2 - 2 sqrt(5) i sqrt(5) + (i sqrt(5))^2 = 5 - 10i + (-5) = 0 -10i. Yes, that's correct. So sqrt(-10i) is indeed sqrt(5) - i sqrt(5). So the roots are [ -(1 - i) ± (sqrt(5) - i sqrt(5)) ] / 2.

So first root: [ -1 + i + sqrt(5) - i sqrt(5) ] / 2 = [ (sqrt(5) - 1) + i(1 - sqrt(5)) ] / 2.

Second root: [ -1 + i - sqrt(5) + i sqrt(5) ] / 2 = [ (-1 - sqrt(5)) + i(1 + sqrt(5)) ] / 2. Hmm, these eigenvalues are complex numbers, but maybe they have modulus 1? Let's check the modulus of the first eigenvalue:

sqrt( [ (sqrt(5) - 1)/2 ]^2 + [ (1 - sqrt(5))/2 ]^2 ) = sqrt( ( (sqrt(5)-1)^2 + (1 - sqrt(5))^2 ) / 4 ).

But (sqrt(5)-1)^2 = (1 - sqrt(5))^2, so it's 2*(sqrt(5)-1)^2 /4 = (sqrt(5)-1)^2 /2.

Compute (sqrt(5)-1)^2 = 5 - 2 sqrt(5) +1 = 6 - 2 sqrt(5). So modulus squared is (6 - 2 sqrt(5))/2 = 3 - sqrt(5). Therefore modulus is sqrt(3 - sqrt(5)) ≈ sqrt(3 - 2.236) ≈ sqrt(0.764) ≈ 0.874. So less than 1. Therefore, the eigenvalues have modulus less than 1 and greater than 0.874. Hmm, not sure if this helps.

Alternatively, maybe there's a periodicity in the iterations. Let's see. If we can find that applying F four times brings us back to the original value, then the sequence cycles every 4. Let's test this.

Suppose we start with z_0, compute z_1 = F(z_0), z_2 = F(z_1), etc. If after four steps we return to z_0, then it's periodic with period 4. But in our earlier computation, z_0 = 1/137 + i, z_1 = 1 + 274i, z_2 is some complicated fraction, z_3 would be F(z_2), and so on. It might be tedious, but perhaps we can check if F(F(z)) has a simpler form.

Alternatively, perhaps F is an involution, meaning F(F(z)) = z. Let's check that.

Suppose F(F(z)) = z for all z ≠ i. Let's verify this.

Wait, wait, let me recheck:

Wait, F(F(z)) = [ (1 + i)(z + 1) ] / [ (1 - i)(z - 1) ].

But we found earlier that (1 + i)/(1 - i) = i. Therefore, F(F(z)) = i*(z + 1)/(z - 1).

So F^2(z) = i*(z + 1)/(z - 1). Let's compute F^3(z) = F(F^2(z)) = F( i*(z + 1)/(z - 1) ).

F(F(z)) = [ ( (z + i)/(z - i) ) + i ] / [ ( (z + i)/(z - i) ) - i ].

Multiply numerator and denominator by (z - i):

Numerator: (z + i) + i(z - i) = z + i + i z - i² = z + i + i z + 1 (since i² = -1).

F(w) = (w + i)/(w - i) = [ i*(z + 1)/(z - 1) + i ] / [ i*(z + 1)/(z - 1) - i ].

Factor i in numerator and denominator:

Numerator: i [ (z + 1)/(z - 1) + 1 ] = i [ (z + 1 + z - 1)/(z - 1) ] = i [ (2z)/(z - 1) ].

Denominator: i [ (z + 1)/(z - 1) - 1 ] = i [ (z + 1 - (z - 1))/(z - 1) ] = i [ (2)/(z - 1) ].

Therefore, F(w) = [ i*(2z)/(z - 1) ] / [ i*(2)/(z - 1) ] = [ 2i z / (z - 1) ] / [ 2i / (z - 1) ] = z. So F^3(z) = z.

= z + 1 + i z + i.

Denominator: (z + i) - i(z - i) = z + i - i z + i² = z + i - i z - 1 (since i² = -1).

So denominator: z - i z + i - 1 = z(1 - i) + (i - 1).

So numerator: z(1 + i) + (1 + i) = (1 + i)(z + 1).

Denominator: (1 - i)z + (i - 1) = (1 - i)z - (1 - i) = (1 - i)(z - 1).

Therefore, F(F(z)) = [ (1 + i)(z + 1) ] / [ (1 - i)(z - 1) ].

Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + i)/(1 - i):

Wait, but we can simplify (1 + i)/(1 - i) as i, as done before. So:

(1 + i)/(1 - i) = [ (1 + i)^2 ] / [ (1 - i)(1 + i) ] = (1 + 2i -1)/ (1 - i²) = (2i)/2 = i. So yes, (1 + i)/(1 - i) = i.

Therefore, F(F(z)) = i*(z + 1)/(z - 1).

Let's compute F(z) = (z + i)/(z - i). Let's plug in z0 = 1/137 + i:

F(z0) = ( (1/137 + i) + i ) / ( (1/137 + i) - i ) = (1/137 + 2i)/(1/137). That's correct. Then z1 = 1 + 274i.

Then F(z1) = ( (1 + 274i) + i ) / ( (1 + 274i) - i ) = (1 + 275i)/(1 + 273i). Hmm, but that's different from my previous calculation. Wait, wait, in the initial step, when I computed z1, I think I made a mistake.

Wait, z0 is 1/137 + i. Then z1 = F(z0) = (z0 + i)/(z0 - i). Let's compute numerator and denominator again:

Numerator: z0 + i = (1/137 + i) + i = 1/137 + 2i.

Denominator: z0 - i = (1/137 + i) - i = 1/137.

Therefore, z1 = (1/137 + 2i) / (1/137) = (1 + 274i)/1 = 1 + 274i. Wait, yes, that's correct. Then z1 is 1 + 274i. Then z2 = F(z1) = ( (1 + 274i) + i ) / ( (1 + 274i) - i ) = (1 + 275i)/(1 + 273i). Wait, but in my initial calculation, I had 269i, but here it's 275i over 273i. Wait, this discrepancy suggests I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let's recalculate z1. If z0 = 1/137 + i, then z1 = F(z0) = (z0 + i)/(z0 - i). So:

z0 + i = (1/137 + i) + i = 1/137 + 2i.

z0 - i = (1/137 + i) - i = 1/137.

Therefore, z1 = (1/137 + 2i)/(1/137) = (1 + 274i)/1 = 1 + 274i. Therefore, z1 is 1 + 274i. Then z2 = F(z1) = (1 + 274i + i)/(1 + 274i - i) = (1 + 275i)/(1 + 273i). So numerator is 1 + 275i, denominator is 1 + 273i. Then z2 = (1 + 275i)/(1 + 273i). Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 - 273i):

Wait, denominator becomes (1 + 273i)(1 - 273i) = 1 + (273)^2. Because (a + b)(a - b) = a² - b²i² = a² + b². So 1 + (273)^2 = 1 + 74529 = 74530.

Numerator: (1 + 275i)(1 - 273i) = 1*1 + 1*(-273i) + 275i*1 + 275i*(-273i) = 1 - 273i + 275i - 275*273 i².

Simplify:

1 + ( -273i + 275i ) + ( -275*273*(-1) ) since i² = -1.

So 1 + 2i + 275*273.

Compute 275*273: Let's compute 275*200 = 55,000; 275*73 = 275*70 + 275*3 = 19,250 + 825 = 20,075. So total 55,000 + 20,075 = 75,075. Therefore, numerator is 1 + 2i + 75,075 = 75,076 + 2i.

Therefore, z2 = (75,076 + 2i)/74,530. Simplify:

75,076 / 74,530 ≈ 1.0073, but let's see if we can reduce the fraction. Let's check GCD(75,076, 74,530). Compute 75,076 - 74,530 = 546. Then GCD(74,530, 546). 74,530 ÷ 546 = 136 with remainder 74,530 - 546*136. Compute 546*100=54,600; 546*36=19,656. So 54,600 +19,656=74,256. Then 74,530 -74,256=274. So GCD(546,274). Then 546 ÷274=2 with remainder 546-548= -2? Wait, 274*2=548, which is more than 546. So 274*1=274, remainder 546-274=272. Then GCD(274,272). Then 274-272=2. GCD(272,2). 272 ÷2=136, remainder 0. So GCD is 2. Therefore, divide numerator and denominator by 2:

75,076 ÷2=37,538; 74,530 ÷2=37,265. So z2=37,538 +2i /37,265. Check GCD(37,538,37,265). 37,538 -37,265=273. Then GCD(37,265,273). 37,265 ÷273=136 with remainder 37,265 -273*136. 273*100=27,300; 273*36=9,828. So 27,300 +9,828=37,128. Then 37,265 -37,128=137. GCD(273,137). 273 ÷137=2 with remainder -1. Then GCD(137,1)=1. So no further reduction. Therefore, z2=(37,538 +2i)/37,265.

Wait, but this seems very messy. Maybe there's a different approach here.

Let me compute numerator and denominator:

Numerator: [ i(z + 1)/(z - 1) + i ] = i(z + 1)/(z - 1) + i = i [ (z + 1)/(z - 1) + 1 ] = i [ (z + 1 + z - 1)/(z - 1) ] = i [ (2z)/(z - 1) ] = 2i z / (z - 1).

Denominator: [ i(z + 1)/(z - 1) - i ] = i(z + 1)/(z - 1) - i = i [ (z + 1)/(z - 1) - 1 ] = i [ (z + 1 - (z - 1))/(z - 1) ] = i [ (2)/(z - 1) ] = 2i / (z - 1).

Therefore, F^3(z) = [2i z / (z - 1)] / [2i / (z - 1)] = [2i z / (z - 1)] * [(z - 1)/2i] = z. So F^3(z) = z. Wait, that's interesting! So applying F three times brings us back to z. Therefore, F is cyclic with period 3. That means F^3(z) = z, so the transformation has order 3.

Based on execution_4.4:
Therefore, the sequence z_n is periodic with period 3. That is, z_0, z_1, z_2, z_3 = z_0, z_4 = z_1, etc. So to find z_{2002}, we can compute 2002 modulo 3.

Based on execution_4.3:
Let's verify:

F^3(z) = z.

Let's check this.

Take z_0 = 1/137 + i.

<execution_5.1>
Let's compute 2002 divided by 3. 3*667=2001, so 2002 = 3*667 +1. Therefore, 2002 ≡ 1 mod 3. Therefore, z_{2002} = z_1.

But wait, let's confirm:

n | z_n

0 | z_0

1 | z_1

2 | z_2

3 | z_3 = F(z_2) = F(F(F(z_0))) = F^3(z_0) = z_0

4 | z_4 = F(z_3) = F(z_0) = z_1

5 | z_5 = F(z_4) = z_2

6 | z_6 = F(z_5) = z_3 = z_0

So the cycle is every 3 steps. Therefore, z_{3k} = z_0, z_{3k+1}=z_1, z_{3k+2}=z_2. Therefore, to find z_{2002}, we compute 2002 mod 3. As 2002 = 3*667 +1, so 2002 ≡1 mod3. Therefore, z_{2002}=z_1.

But wait, let's check:

If n=0: 0 mod3=0 → z0

n=1:1 mod3=1 → z1

n=2:2 mod3=2 → z2

n=3:3 mod3=0 → z0

Yes, so 2002 mod3=1, so z_{2002}=z1. Therefore, the answer is z1, which is 1 +274i. But wait, let's confirm with the earlier calculation where z2 was (75,076 +2i)/74,530. If we apply F to z2, we should get back z0.

Compute F(z2) = (z2 +i)/(z2 -i). Let's substitute z2:

Numerator: z2 +i = [ (75,076 +2i)/74,530 + i ] = (75,076 +2i +74,530i)/74,530 = (75,076 +74,532i)/74,530.

Denominator: z2 -i = [ (75,076 +2i)/74,530 -i ] = (75,076 +2i -74,530i)/74,530 = (75,076 -74,528i)/74,530.

Therefore, F(z2) = [75,076 +74,532i]/[75,076 -74,528i]. Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:

[75,076 +74,532i][75,076 +74,528i] / [ (75,076)^2 + (74,528)^2 ].

But this seems tedious. Alternatively, note that if F^3(z)=z, then applying F three times brings us back to the original z. Therefore, if we accept that F^3(z)=z, then z3 = z0, z4 = z1, etc. Therefore, the sequence cycles every 3 steps.
</execution_5.1>

<execution_5.2>
Then z_1 = F(z0) = 1 + 274i.

Then z_2 = F(z1) = (1 + 275i)/(1 + 273i). Then z_3 = F(z2) should be z0 again. Let's check:

Compute z_3 = F(z2) = F( (1 + 275i)/(1 + 273i) ).

Let me compute numerator and denominator:

Numerator: ( (1 + 275i)/(1 + 273i) ) + i = [ (1 + 275i) + i*(1 + 273i) ] / (1 + 273i).

Compute numerator:

1 + 275i + i + 273i² = 1 + 276i + 273(-1) = 1 + 276i - 273 = -272 + 276i.

Denominator: (1 + 273i).

Then, numerator is (-272 + 276i)/(1 + 273i). Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 - 273i):

Denominator: (1 + 273i)(1 - 273i) = 1 + (273)^2 = 1 + 74529 = 74530.

Numerator: (-272 + 276i)(1 - 273i) = -272*1 + 272*273i + 276i*1 - 276i*273i.

Compute each term:

-272 + (272*273)i + 276i - 276*273 i².

Simplify:

-272 + (272*273 + 276)i + 276*273*1 (since i² = -1, so -276*273*(-1) = +276*273).

Compute constants:

First, -272 + 276*273.

Compute 276*273: Let's compute 200*273=54,600; 70*273=19,110; 6*273=1,638. So total 54,600 +19,110=73,710 +1,638=75,348. Then -272 +75,348=75,076.

Now the i term: 272*273 +276.

Compute 272*273: As before, 272*200=54,400; 272*73=19,756. So 54,400 +19,756=74,156. Then add 276: 74,156 +276=74,432.

Therefore, numerator is 75,076 +74,432i.

Therefore, z_3 = (75,076 +74,432i)/74,530. Simplify:

75,076 /74,530 ≈ 1.0073, but let's see if this simplifies. Let's check if numerator and denominator have a common factor. Let's compute GCD(75,076,74,530). 75,076 -74,530=546. Then GCD(74,530,546). 74,530 ÷546=136 with remainder 74,530 -546*136. Compute 546*100=54,600; 546*36=19,656. So 54,600 +19,656=74,256. Then 74,530 -74,256=274. So GCD(546,274). Then 546 ÷274=2 with remainder 546 -548= -2, but absolute value 2. Then GCD(274,2)=2. Therefore, divide numerator and denominator by 2:

75,076 ÷2=37,538; 74,530 ÷2=37,265. So z_3=37,538 +74,432i /37,265. Check GCD(37,538,37,265). 37,538 -37,265=273. Then GCD(37,265,273). 37,265 ÷273=136 with remainder 37,265 -273*136. 273*100=27,300; 273*36=9,828. So 27,300 +9,828=37,128. Then 37,265 -37,128=137. GCD(273,137). 273 ÷137=2 with remainder -1. Then GCD(137,1)=1. So no further reduction. Therefore, z_3=(37,538 +74,432i)/37,265.

But z_0 was 1/137 + i, which is approximately 0.0073 + 1i. However, z_3 is a different complex number. Wait, this contradicts the earlier conclusion that F^3(z) = z. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, earlier when I assumed F^3(z) = z, but when I computed z_3, it didn't return to z0. Therefore, my earlier conclusion was incorrect. Let me retrace the steps.

Earlier, I tried to compute F^3(z) symbolically and concluded it equals z, but when plugging in z0, it didn't work. Therefore, there must be an error in the symbolic computation. Let me re-examine the symbolic computation.

Earlier, I had:

F^2(z) = i(z + 1)/(z - 1).

Then F^3(z) = F(F^2(z)) = [ (i(z + 1)/(z - 1) ) + i ] / [ (i(z + 1)/(z - 1) ) - i ].

Let me recompute this step carefully.

Compute F(0) = (0 + i)/(0 - i) = i / (-i) = -1. Then F(-1) = (-1 + i)/(-1 - i). Multiply numerator and denominator by (-1 + i):

Numerator: (-1 + i)(-1 + i) = 1 - 2i + i² = 1 - 2i -1 = -2i.

Denominator: (-1 - i)(-1 + i) = 1 - i² = 1 - (-1) = 2.

Therefore, F(-1) = -2i / 2 = -i. Then F(-i) = (-i + i)/(-i - i) = 0/(-2i) = 0. So starting from 0, the sequence is 0 → -1 → -i → 0 → ... which is a cycle of length 3. Wait, but in our case, the initial term is z0 = 1/137 + i, which is different from 0. However, if the cycle length is 3, then regardless of the starting point, the sequence cycles every 3 steps. But in our case, the initial transformation might not follow the same cycle. Wait, no, the function F is the same, so regardless of the starting point (as long as it's not i), the transformations should follow the same cycle structure. Therefore, if F^3(z) = z, then indeed the sequence is periodic with period 3. But in our numerical example starting at 0, we saw that 0 → -1 → -i → 0, which is a cycle of length 3. Therefore, the general case should also have period 3. Therefore, z_{n+3} = z_n for all n. Hence, z_{2002} = z_{2002 mod 3}. Since 2002 divided by 3 is 667*3=2001, remainder 1. Therefore, 2002 ≡1 mod3. Therefore, z_{2002}=z_1=1 +274i. Therefore, the answer is 1 +274i.
