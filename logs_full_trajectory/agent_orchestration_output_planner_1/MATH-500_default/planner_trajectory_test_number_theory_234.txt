Okay, so I have this problem here: When the two-digit integer "AB" is cubed, the value is 912,673. What is A + B? Alright, let me try to figure this out step by step. First, I need to understand what the problem is asking. AB is a two-digit number, right? So A is the tens digit and B is the units digit. When we cube this two-digit number, we get 912673. The question is asking for the sum of A and B.

Hmm, so essentially, we need to find the two-digit number AB such that (AB)^3 = 912673. Then, once we find AB, we can just add its digits A and B to get the answer.

The first thought that comes to my mind is to take the cube root of 912673 to find the original number AB. Since AB is a two-digit number, its cube should be somewhere between 100000 (which is 47^3, because 40^3 is 64000, 50^3 is 125000) and 999999 (which is 99^3, since 100^3 is 1,000,000). Wait, but 912673 is less than 1,000,000, so the cube root should be less than 100. But AB is a two-digit number, so it's between 10 and 99. Therefore, the cube root of 912673 should be a two-digit number.

So, let me calculate the cube root of 912673. Let me see. Maybe I can estimate it.

Let's start by figuring out what number cubed gives 912,673. Let me think of some numbers. Let's start with 100: 100^3 is 1,000,000, which is higher than 912,673. So the number we're looking for is less than 100. Let's try 90: 90^3 is 729,000. That's lower than 912,673. So the cube root is between 90 and 100. Let's try 95: 95^3.

Wait, but maybe there's a mistake here. Let me double-check my calculations because 95^3 is definitely not 912,673. Let me recalculate 95 cubed.

<prompt_1.2> Recalculate 95 cubed to verify the result. </prompt_1.2>

But wait, let me make sure there isn't another two-digit number whose cube is 912673. Maybe I miscalculated the cube?

<prompt_1.3> Confirm that 95 is the only two-digit number whose cube is 912,673. </prompt_1.3>

<execution_1.1>
Let's calculate 95^3. 95 squared is 9025, then 9025 multiplied by 95. Let's do that step by step. 9025 * 95. Break it down: 9025 * 90 = 812,250 and 9025 * 5 = 45,125. Adding those together: 812,250 + 45,125 = 857,375. So 95^3 is 857,375. That's still less than 912,673. So the number is higher than 95.
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
95 times 95 is 9025. Then 9025 times 95. Let's break that down. 9025 * 95 = 9025*(100 - 5) = 9025*100 - 9025*5 = 902500 - 45125 = 857,375.
</execution_1.2>

<execution_1.3>
Let me check 95 again. 95*95: 90*90=8100, 90*5=450, 5*90=450, 5*5=25. So 8100 + 450 + 450 +25 = 9025. Then 9025*95. Let me break this down: 9025*95 = 9025*(100 -5) = 9025*100 - 9025*5 = 902500 - 45125 = 857,375. Wait, that's 857,375. Hmm, which is different from 912,673. So that's not matching.

Based on execution_1.1:
Next, try 97: 97^3. Let's compute 97 squared: 9409. Then 9409 * 97. Let's do this multiplication.

<prompt_2.1> Calculate 97 cubed and determine if it equals 912,673. </prompt_2.1>

Based on execution_1.3:
Wait, but the original problem says that AB cubed is 912,673, so AB must be 97, but 97^3 is 912,673. Wait, but my calculation of 97^3 was 912,673. Wait, but when I calculated 97^3, I got 912,673.

<prompt_2.2> Confirm that 97 is the correct two-digit number and its cube is 912,673. </prompt_2.2>

Based on execution_1.3:
Wait, but let me check another way. Let me compute 97^3 step by step.

<prompt_2.3> Recalculate 97 cubed step by step to confirm the result. </prompt_2.3>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
9409 * 100 = 940,900. Subtract 9409*3 = 28,227. So 940,900 - 28,227 = 912,673. Wait a minute, that's exactly the number we have! So 97^3 is 912,673.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
But earlier, when I tried 95, I got 857,375. Then 97: 97 squared is 9409. Then 9409 * 97. Let me compute that. 9409 * 100 = 940,900. Then subtract 9409 * 3 (since 100 - 97 = 3). So 940,900 - 28,227 = 912,673. Wait, that's exactly the number! So 97^3 is 912,673.
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
97 squared is 9409. Then 9409 * 97. Let's compute 9409 * 100 = 940900. Then subtract 9409 * 3 = 28,227. So 940900 - 28,227 = 912,673. Yes, that's correct. So 97^3 is indeed 912,673.

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Wait, so AB is 97? Then A is 9 and B is 7, so A + B is 16.

But let me confirm. Let me check 97 cubed again to make sure.

<prompt_3.1> Verify that 97 is the correct two-digit number and confirm the result. </prompt_3.1>

Based on execution_2.2:
So AB is 97, so A is 9 and B is 7, so A + B = 16.

But wait, let me check once more to be absolutely sure. Let me compute 97 cubed manually.

<prompt_3.2> Manually recompute 97 cubed to ensure accuracy. </prompt_3.2>

Based on execution_2.3:
Therefore, the two-digit number AB is 97, so A = 9 and B = 7. Therefore, A + B = 9 + 7 = 16.

Based on execution_1.3:
Wait, but just to make sure there's no other two-digit number close to 97 that might cube to 912,673. Let's check 96^3.

<prompt_3.3> Check if any other two-digit numbers close to 97 could cube to 912,673. </prompt_3.3>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
First, 97 * 97. 97*90 = 8730, 97*7 = 679. So 8730 + 679 = 9409. Then 9409 * 97. Let's do 9409*100 = 940900, subtract 9409*3 = 28227. So 940900 - 28227 = 912,673.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
First, 97 * 97. 90*90 = 8100, 90*7 = 630, 7*90 = 630, 7*7 = 49. So adding them up: 8100 + 630 + 630 + 49 = 8100 + 1260 + 49 = 9409. Then 9409 * 97. Let's do this as (9409 * 100) - (9409 * 3) = 940900 - 28227 = 912,673.
</execution_3.2>

<execution_3.3>
96^3: 96 squared is 9216. Then 9216 * 96. Let's compute that. 9216 * 100 = 921,600. Subtract 9216 * 4 = 36,864. So 921,600 - 36,864 = 884,736. That's less than 912,673. So 96^3 is 884,736. Then 97^3 is 912,673, and 98^3 would be higher. Let's check 98^3. 98^3 is 941,192. Which is higher than 912,673. So 97 is the only two-digit number whose cube is 912,673.

Based on execution_3.3:
Therefore, A is 9 and B is 7, so A + B is 16.
I think that's solid.
