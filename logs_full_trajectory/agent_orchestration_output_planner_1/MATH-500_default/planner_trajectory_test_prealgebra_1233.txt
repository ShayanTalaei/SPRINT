Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, we have a square, and we're supposed to decrease the length of two opposite sides by 40% and increase the other two sides by 50%. Then, this forms a rectangle, and we need to find by what percent the square's area decreases. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

<prompt_1.1> Define the side length of the square and calculate the new dimensions of the rectangle after applying the given percentage changes. </prompt_1.1>

<execution_1.1>
First, let's recall that all sides of a square are equal. Let's denote the original side length of the square as, say, 's'. Then, the original area of the square would be s multiplied by s, which is s². That's straightforward.

Now, according to the problem, two opposite sides are decreased by 40%. If the original length is 's', decreasing it by 40% means we take 40% of 's' and subtract that from 's'. So, 40% of s is 0.4s. Therefore, the new length for those sides would be s - 0.4s = 0.6s. Got that. So, two sides become 0.6s each.

Then, the other two opposite sides are increased by 50%. Again, starting from the original length 's', increasing it by 50% means adding 50% of 's' to 's'. 50% of s is 0.5s, so the new length here would be s + 0.5s = 1.5s. Okay, so the other two sides become 1.5s each.

So now, the rectangle formed has sides of 0.6s and 1.5s. Therefore, the area of the rectangle is the product of these two dimensions, which is 0.6s * 1.5s. Let me compute that. 0.6 multiplied by 1.5 is... let's see. 0.6 times 1 is 0.6, and 0.6 times 0.5 is 0.3, so adding those together gives 0.6 + 0.3 = 0.9. So, 0.9s². Therefore, the area of the rectangle is 0.9s².

Based on execution_1.1:
Wait, the original area was s², and the new area is 0.9s², so the area has decreased. To find the percentage decrease, we need to compare the decrease in area to the original area.

<prompt_2.1> Calculate the percentage decrease in area based on the original area. </prompt_2.1>

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me verify again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

First, confirming the new side lengths.

<prompt_2.2> Verify the calculations of the new side lengths and the area decrease. </prompt_2.2>

But let me think again. The problem says "the lengths of two opposite sides are decreased by 40% while the lengths of the other two sides are increased by 50% to form a rectangle". So, in a square, all sides are equal, so when we modify two opposite sides, we are essentially changing the length and width of the square into a rectangle. So, the original square has length and width both equal to 's'.

<prompt_2.3> Re-evaluate the problem statement and confirm the solution using different approaches. </prompt_2.3>

But let me try plugging in a real number to see if this works. Let's take a square with side length 10 units.

<prompt_2.4> Use a real number example to verify the solution and confirm the area decrease. </prompt_2.4>

But wait, sometimes when dealing with percentage changes, especially when increasing and decreasing, people might get confused about whether the operations are multiplicative or additive. But in this case, since it's a square, the operations are straightforward: two sides are decreased by 40%, and the other two are increased by 50%. Since a square has four sides, but when forming a rectangle, the sides are in pairs.

<prompt_2.5> Discuss potential confusion with percentage changes and finalize the solution. </prompt_2.5>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
The decrease in area is s² - 0.9s² = 0.1s². Then, the percentage decrease is (0.1s² / s²) * 100% = 0.1 * 100% = 10%. So, the area decreases by 10%.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
The original side is 's'. Decreasing by 40%: 1 - 0.4 = 0.6, so 0.6s. Correct. Increasing by 50%: 1 + 0.5 = 1.5, so 1.5s. Correct. Then, area of rectangle is 0.6s * 1.5s = 0.9s². Original area was s², so the difference is s² - 0.9s² = 0.1s². Therefore, the area has decreased by 0.1s². To find the percentage decrease, we take (0.1s² / s²) * 100% = 10%. So, the area decreases by 10%.
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
So, if we decrease two opposite sides by 40%, those sides become 0.6s, and the other two sides become 1.5s. So, the rectangle now has dimensions 0.6s by 1.5s. The area is then 0.6s * 1.5s = 0.9s². So, the original area was s², the new area is 0.9s², so the area has decreased by 0.1s². Therefore, the percentage decrease is (0.1s² / s²) * 100% = 10%. So, the area decreases by 10%.
</execution_2.3>

<execution_2.4>
Decreasing two opposite sides by 40% would make those sides 10 - 40% of 10 = 10 - 4 = 6 units. Then increasing the other two sides by 50% would make them 10 + 5 = 15 units. So, the rectangle has dimensions 6x15. The area of the original square is 10*10 = 100. The area of the rectangle is 6*15 = 90. So, the area decreased by 10 units. The percentage decrease is (10/100)*100 = 10%.
</execution_2.4>

<execution_2.5>
So, in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So, if we decrease two opposite sides by 40%, those become 0.6s, and the other two opposite sides are increased by 50%, becoming 1.5s. Therefore, the rectangle has dimensions 0.6s by 1.5s. The area is then 0.6s * 1.5s = 0.9s², as before. So, the area is 0.9 times the original area, which is a 10% decrease. So, the answer should be 10% decrease.

But let me check with actual numbers. Let's take s = 10, as before. Then original area is 10*10=100. After the change, two sides are 0.6*10=6, and the other two sides are 1.5*10=15. So, the rectangle is 6 by 15. Area is 6*15=90. So, original area 100, new area 90. The difference is 10, which is a 10% decrease. So that's 10% decrease. So, that seems correct.

But wait, let me make sure there isn't a common mistake here. For example, sometimes people might think that increasing by 50% and decreasing by 40% would offset each other, but since one is length and the other is width, the percentage changes multiply. However, in this case, since the operations are on different sides, the area is affected by both changes. So, the area scaling factor is 0.6 * 1.5 = 0.9, which is a 10% decrease. So, that seems right.

Alternatively, if you have a square and you change two adjacent sides, the area would be different, but here we are changing opposite sides. Wait, but in a square, all sides are adjacent as well. Wait, no, in a square, all sides are adjacent. Wait, but when we talk about opposite sides, in a square, opposite sides are parallel but not adjacent. So, when you change two opposite sides, you are effectively changing the length of the rectangle, and the other two opposite sides are the width. So, for example, if you have a square, and you shrink two opposite sides (length) and expand the other two opposite sides (width), you get a rectangle with adjusted length and width.

So, in terms of area, original area is s². New area is (0.6s)*(1.5s) = 0.9s². So, the ratio of new area to old area is 0.9, which is a 90% of the original area, so a 10% decrease. Therefore, the answer is 10%.

But let me just consider another perspective. Suppose we don't set the original side as 's', but assign a numerical value. Let's take s = 20. Then, decreasing two sides by 40%: 20 - 0.4*20 = 20 - 8 = 12. Increasing the other two sides by 50%: 20 + 0.5*20 = 20 + 10 = 30. Then, area is 12*30 = 360. Original area was 20*20 = 400. 360/400 = 0.9, so 10% decrease. Yep, same result. So, regardless of the side length, the percentage decrease is 10%.

Therefore, I think the answer is 10% decrease.
