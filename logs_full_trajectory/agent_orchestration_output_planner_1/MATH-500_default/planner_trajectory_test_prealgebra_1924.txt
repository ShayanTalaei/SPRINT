Okay, let's see. I need to simplify the expression (-k + 4) + (-2 + 3k). Hmm, right. So, first, I remember that simplifying such expressions involves combining like terms. Like terms are terms with the same variable raised to the same power, so the terms with 'k' and the constant numbers separately.

Let me start by writing down the expression again to make sure I have it right: (-k + 4) + (-2 + 3k). Alright, so there are two parts here: the first part is (-k + 4) and the second part is (-2 + 3k). When we add them together, we need to remove the parentheses first, right? So, just remove the parentheses without changing the signs of the terms inside. Let me check that. Since there's a plus sign before the second parenthesis, the signs of the terms inside the second parenthesis stay the same. So, removing the parentheses, it becomes -k + 4 - 2 + 3k.

Based on execution_1.1:
Now, let's rearrange the terms to group the like terms together.
So, the terms with 'k' are -k and +3k. The constant terms are +4 and -2. Let me write that out: (-k + 3k) + (4 - 2). 

Now, combining the like terms. For the 'k' terms: -k + 3k.
Hmm, that's like adding -1k and 3k. So, (-1 + 3)k = 2k. Okay, that seems right. Then for the constants: 4 - 2 is 2. So, putting it all together, we have 2k + 2.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any signs. The original expression is (-k + 4) + (-2 + 3k). So when I remove the parentheses, it's -k + 4 - 2 + 3k.
Yes, that's correct. Then combining -k and 3k gives 2k, and 4 - 2 is indeed 2. So the simplified form should be 2k + 2.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as combining all terms in one go. Let's see: -k + 4 -2 +3k. So, coefficients of k: -1 +3 =2.

<prompt_2.1> Use the alternative method to combine terms and verify the result as per the above plan. </prompt_2.1>

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to approach it. Let's distribute the addition across both binomials. So, (-k +4) + (-2 +3k) can be thought of as (-k +4) + (-2) +3k.
Then, combining the constants first: 4 + (-2) =2. Then the variables: -k +3k=2k. So again, 2k +2.

<execution_2.1>
Constants:4 -2=2. So, 2k +2.
</execution_2.1>
</Execution_2>

<Final_answer>
Therefore, the simplified expression is $\boxed{2k+2}$.
