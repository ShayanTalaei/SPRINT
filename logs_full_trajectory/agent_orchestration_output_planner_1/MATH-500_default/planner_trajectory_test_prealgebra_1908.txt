</Question>

<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to figure out how many positive two-digit integers are factors of both 100 and 150. Hmm, let's start by understanding what the problem is asking. 

First, a two-digit integer is any number from 10 to 99. The question is asking how many of these numbers are factors of both 100 and 150. In other words, we need to find the common factors of 100 and 150 that are two-digit numbers. Then count how many there are.

Let me recall that the common factors of two numbers are the factors of their greatest common divisor (GCD). So, if I find the GCD of 100 and 150, then the factors of that GCD which are two-digit numbers will be the answer.

First step: Find GCD(100, 150). 

To find the GCD, I can use the prime factorization method.

Let's factorize both numbers:

<prompt_1.1> Use the prime factorization method to find the GCD of 100 and 150. </prompt_1.1>

But wait, just to be thorough, let's list all factors of 50 and check which are two-digit. Factors of 50: 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50. So two-digit ones are 10,25,50. That's three numbers.

But just to ensure that there isn't a mistake in the GCD calculation. Let me verify GCD(100,150) again.

Alternatively, using the Euclidean algorithm:

<prompt_1.2> Verify the GCD of 100 and 150 using the Euclidean algorithm. </prompt_1.2>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
100: The prime factors are 2^2 * 5^2. Because 100 = 2*2 * 5*5.

150: Let's break it down. 150 = 15*10 = (3*5) * (2*5) = 2 * 3 * 5^2. So prime factors are 2^1 * 3^1 * 5^2.

The GCD is the product of the smallest powers of the common prime factors. So the common primes are 2 and 5.

For prime 2: the smallest exponent is 1 (from 150) compared to 2 (from 100), so 2^1.

For prime 5: the smallest exponent is 2 (both have 5^2), so 5^2.

Therefore, GCD(100, 150) = 2^1 * 5^2 = 2 * 25 = 50.
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
GCD(100,150). Since 150 divided by 100 is 1 with remainder 50. Then GCD(100,50). 100 divided by 50 is 2 with remainder 0. So GCD is 50.

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
So the common factors of 100 and 150 are the factors of 50.
The factors of 50 are 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50. But we need the two-digit ones. So from this list, the two-digit numbers are 10, 25, and 50.

Wait, that's three numbers.
So does that mean the answer is 3?

Hold on, let me make sure I didn't miss any factors.

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's list all the factors of 100 and all the factors of 150, then find their intersection, and count the two-digit ones.

<prompt_2.1> List all factors of 100 and 150, find their intersection, and count the two-digit common factors. </prompt_2.1>

But let me check again. Maybe there's a mistake in the factors.

Wait, let's list the factors of 100:

<prompt_2.2> Recheck the factors of 100 and 150 and confirm the two-digit common factors. </prompt_2.2>

But wait, hold on. Let me make sure that factors like 25 and 50 are indeed factors of both 100 and 150.

<prompt_2.3> Verify that 25 and 50 are indeed factors of both 100 and 150. </prompt_2.3>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Factors of 100: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100.

Factors of 150: Let's see. 150 is 15*10, so factors are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 25, 30, 50, 75, 150.

Now, the common factors would be the numbers that appear in both lists. Let's compare:

Factors of 100: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100.

Factors of 150: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 25, 30, 50, 75, 150.

Intersection of these sets: 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50. 

Wait, that's six numbers. Wait, did I miss some? Let's check each number:

1 is in both.

2 is in both.

4 is only in 100.

5 is in both.

10 is in both.

20 only in 100.

25 is in both.

50 is in both.

100 only in 100.

For 150's factors: 1,2,3,5,6,10,15,25,30,50,75,150. So the common ones are indeed 1,2,5,10,25,50. So six numbers. Then the two-digit ones are 10,25,50. So three numbers.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100. 

Factors of 150:
1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 25, 30, 50, 75, 150.

Now, find the common factors. Comparing the two lists:

From 100: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100.

From 150: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 25, 30, 50, 75, 150.

The common factors are: 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50. 

So again, the common factors are 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50. From these, the two-digit numbers are 10, 25, 50. So three numbers.
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
25 divides 100 (100 ÷25=4) and 150 ÷25=6. Yes, that's an integer. 50 divides 100 (100 ÷50=2) and 150 ÷50=3. Also an integer. 10 divides both (100 ÷10=10, 150 ÷10=15). So yes, those three numbers are common factors. 

So the answer should be 3.
</execution_2.3>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_1.1, execution_2.1:
Wait, but earlier when I calculated the GCD, I thought the GCD is 50, whose factors are 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50.
Which matches the intersection. So the two-digit ones are 10, 25, 50. So three numbers.

So the answer should be 3.

But just to ensure, let's think if there's any other two-digit number that divides both 100 and 150.

<prompt_3.1> Verify that there are no other two-digit common factors by checking divisibility. </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
Let's take 25: 100 ÷25=4, 150 ÷25=6. Both integers. 50: 100 ÷50=2, 150 ÷50=3. Integers. 10: 100 ÷10=10, 150 ÷10=15. Integers. Any others? Let's see. For example, 15: divides 150 but 150 ÷15=10, but 100 ÷15 is not an integer. 20: divides 100 but not 150. 30: divides 150 but not 100. 75: divides 150 but not 100. 100: too big. So no, there are no other two-digit numbers.

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
1. Find GCD(100,150) = 50.

3. Alternatively, list factors of both numbers and find the intersection, then count two-digit ones. Same result.

Therefore, the answer is 3.
