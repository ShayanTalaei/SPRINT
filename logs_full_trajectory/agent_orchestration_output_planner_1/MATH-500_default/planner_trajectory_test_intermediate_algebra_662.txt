Okay, so I need to find the real roots of this equation. Let me write it down again to make sure I have it right:

\[
\frac{(x + 1)(x - 3)}{5(x + 2)(x - 4)} + \frac{(x + 3)(x - 5)}{9(x + 4)(x - 6)} - \frac{2(x + 5)(x - 7)}{13(x + 6)(x - 8)} = \frac{92}{585}.
\]

Hmm, this looks pretty complicated. It's a rational equation with three terms on the left side, each involving quadratic numerators and quadratic denominators, and then a constant on the right. The denominators have linear factors, so I should note the values of x that make the denominators zero, as those would be excluded from the domain.

<prompt_1.1> Identify the excluded values from the domain of the given rational equation. </prompt_1.1>

The equation is a sum of three fractions equal to 92/585. Since each term is a rational function, solving this might involve combining the fractions over a common denominator, but that could get very messy given the denominators are all different and factorized. Let me check the denominators:

<prompt_1.2> Analyze the denominators of the given rational equation to determine the complexity of solving it. </prompt_1.2>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
Specifically, the denominators are 5(x + 2)(x - 4), 9(x + 4)(x - 6), and 13(x + 6)(x - 8). So, x cannot be -2, 4, -4, 6, -6, or 8. These are vertical asymptotes or points where the function is undefined.
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
First term's denominator: 5(x + 2)(x - 4)

Second term's denominator: 9(x + 4)(x - 6)

Third term's denominator: 13(x + 6)(x - 8)

So each denominator is a product of three linear factors (with coefficients 1 except for the constants 5, 9, 13). The denominators are all different and don't share any common factors. Therefore, the common denominator would be 5*9*13*(x + 2)(x - 4)(x + 4)(x - 6)(x + 6)(x - 8). That's a lot of factors. Expanding all that would be extremely tedious and probably error-prone. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this problem.

Alternatively, since the equation is equal to a constant, maybe we can move everything to one side and set it to zero, then combine the fractions. Let me try that.

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.2:
So:

First term + Second term - Third term - 92/585 = 0.

But combining these fractions would require a common denominator as mentioned before. Let me denote the denominators as D1, D2, D3 for simplicity:

<prompt_2.1> Calculate the common denominator and simplify the equation. </prompt_2.1>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
D1 = 5(x + 2)(x - 4)

D2 = 9(x + 4)(x - 6)

D3 = 13(x + 6)(x - 8)

So the common denominator is D1*D2*D3. Therefore, each term needs to be multiplied by the other denominators.

But this seems very algebraically intensive. Let me see if there's another approach. Maybe substituting variables or noticing a pattern?

Alternatively, since the equation is a sum of three rational functions equal to a constant, perhaps each term is evaluated at specific x values that simplify the equation. For example, if we can find x values that make two of the denominators zero, but since x can't be those values, maybe there's a symmetry or specific x that simplifies the equation.

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Looking at the numerators:

First term's numerator: (x + 1)(x - 3)

Second term's numerator: (x + 3)(x - 5)

Third term's numerator: 2(x + 5)(x - 7)

Not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe trying to plug in some integer values for x that aren't excluded (i.e., not in {-6, -4, -2, 4, 6, 8}) and see if they satisfy the equation. Since the denominators are zero at those points, but maybe some integers could simplify the equation.

Let me try x = 0.

Plugging x = 0:

First term: (0 + 1)(0 - 3)/(5*(0 + 2)(0 - 4)) = (1*(-3))/(5*2*(-4)) = (-3)/(-40) = 3/40

Second term: (0 + 3)(0 - 5)/(9*(0 + 4)(0 - 6)) = (3*(-5))/(9*4*(-6)) = (-15)/(-216) = 15/216 = 5/72

Third term: -2*(0 + 5)(0 - 7)/(13*(0 + 6)(0 - 8)) = -2*(5*(-7))/(13*6*(-8)) = -2*(-35)/(-624) = -2*(-35)/(-624) = -70/624 = -35/312

Adding them up: 3/40 + 5/72 - 35/312. Let's compute this.

Convert to common denominator. Let's see, 40, 72, 312. Prime factors:

40 = 2^3 *5

72 = 2^3 *3^2

312 = 8*39 = 8*3*13 = 2^3 *3*13

So LCM is 2^3 *3^2 *5 *13 = 8*9*5*13 = 8*9=72; 72*5=360; 360*13=4680.

So convert each fraction:

3/40 = (3*117)/(40*117) = 351/4680

5/72 = (5*65)/(72*65) = 325/4680

-35/312 = (-35*15)/(312*15) = -525/4680

Adding: 351 + 325 - 525 = (351 + 325) = 676; 676 -525 = 151. So 151/4680 ≈ 0.0322. The right side is 92/585 ≈ 0.157. Not equal. So x=0 not a root.

<execution_3.2>
First term: ( -3 )( -1 ) / [5*(-2)(-6)] = (3)/[5*12] = 3/60 = 1/20

Second term: (4)(-2)/[9*(1)(-5)] = (-8)/(-45) = 8/45

Third term: -2*(8)(-2)/[13*(-1)(-7)] = -2*(-16)/[13*7] = 32/91

Adding them up: 1/20 + 8/45 + 32/91

Let's compute this. Convert to common denominator. Let's see, denominators 20, 45, 91. Prime factors:

20: 2^2, 5

45: 3^2, 5

91: 7, 13

So LCD is 2^2 * 3^2 * 5 * 7 * 13. That's 4*9*5*7*13. Let me compute that:

4*9 = 36; 36*5 = 180; 180*7 = 1260; 1260*13 = 16380.

So convert each fraction:

1/20 = 819/16380

8/45 = (8*364)/16380 = 2912/16380

32/91 = (32*180)/16380 = 5760/16380

Adding them: 819 + 2912 + 5760 = 819 + 2912 is 3731; 3731 + 5760 = 9491

So total is 9491/16380 ≈ 0.577. The right-hand side is 92/585 ≈ 0.157. Not equal. So x=1 is not a root.

<execution_3.3>
First term: ( -1 * -3 ) / (5*(2)*(-4)) = 3 / (5*2*(-4)) = 3 / (-40) = -3/40

Second term: (4 * -2) / (9*(5)*(-5)) = (-8) / (9*5*(-5)) = (-8)/(-225) = 8/225

Third term: 2*(8*(-2)) / (13*(1)*(-7)) = 2*(-16)/(-91) = (-32)/(-91) = 32/91

So total left side: -3/40 + 8/225 - 32/91 ≈ Let's compute this. Let me convert to decimals:

-3/40 = -0.075

8/225 ≈ 0.035555...

32/91 ≈ 0.351646...

So sum: -0.075 + 0.035555 - 0.351646 ≈ -0.075 + 0.035555 = -0.039445; then -0.039445 -0.351646 ≈ -0.391091

Third term: -2(0 +5)(0 -7)/(13(0 +6)(0 -8)) = -2*(5)(-7)/(13*6*(-8)) = -2*(-35)/(13*-48) = 70/( -624) = -70/624 = -35/312

Adding them up: 3/40 + 5/72 - 35/312. Let's convert to common denominator. Let's see, 40, 72, 312. LCM of 40 and 72 is 360. Then LCM of 360 and 312. Let's see: 360 factors into 2^3*3^2*5, 312 is 8*39=8*3*13, so LCM is 2^3*3^2*5*13= 8*9*5*13= 360*65=23400. That's big. Alternatively, compute decimal approx:

3/40 = 0.075

5/72 ≈ 0.0694

35/312 ≈ 0.1121

So total: 0.075 + 0.0694 - 0.1121 ≈ 0.0323. 92/585 ≈ 0.157. Not close. So x=1 not a root.

x = 0: Let's check again.

First term: (0 +1)(0 -3)/(5*(0 +2)(0 -4)) = (1)(-3)/(5*2*(-4)) = -3 / (-40) = 3/40 = 0.075

Second term: (0 +3)(0 -5)/(9*(0 +4)(0 -6)) = (3)(-5)/(9*4*(-6)) = -15 / (-216) = 15/216 ≈ 0.0694

Third term: -2*(0 +5)(0 -7)/(13*(0 +6)(0 -8)) = -2*(5)(-7)/(13*6*(-8)) = -2*(-35)/(13*-48) = 70 / (-624) ≈ -0.1121

Sum: 0.075 + 0.0694 - 0.1121 ≈ 0.0323, which is about 0.0323, and 92/585 ≈ 0.157. Not equal.

First, x=0:

First term: (0+1)(0-3)/(5(0+2)(0-4)) = (1)(-3)/(5*2*(-4)) = (-3)/(-40) = 3/40

Second term: (0+3)(0-5)/(9(0+4)(0-6)) = (3)(-5)/(9*4*(-6)) = (-15)/(-216) = 15/216 = 5/72

Third term: -2(0+5)(0-7)/(13(0+6)(0-8)) = -2(5)(-7)/(13*6*(-8)) = -2*(-35)/(13*(-48)) = 70/(-624) = -35/312

Adding them up: 3/40 + 5/72 - 35/312. Let's convert to common denominator, which is 780 perhaps? Wait, 40=8*5, 72=8*9, 312=8*39. Maybe 240? Let's see:

3/40 = 18/240

5/72 = (5*2.777)/240 ≈ 13.888/240

But exact calculation:

Convert all to denominator 780:

3/40 = (3*19.5)/780 = 58.5/780

5/72 = (5*10.833...)/780 ≈ 54.166.../780

-35/312 = (-35*2.5)/780 = -87.5/780

Adding up: 58.5 + 54.166... -87.5 ≈ 25.166.../780 ≈ 0.0324. 92/585 ≈ 0.157. So not equal. So x=0 not a root.

x=1:

First term: (1+1)(1-3)/(5(1+2)(1-4)) = (2)(-2)/(5*3*(-3)) = (-4)/(-45) = 4/45 ≈ 0.0889

Second term: (1+3)(1-5)/(9(1+4)(1-6)) = (4)(-4)/(9*5*(-5)) = (-16)/(-225) = 16/225 ≈ 0.0711

Total: 4/45 + 16/225 - 72/637. Let's convert to decimals:

4/45 ≈ 0.0889, 16/225 ≈ 0.0711, -72/637 ≈ -0.1125. Sum ≈ 0.0889 + 0.0711 - 0.1125 ≈ 0.0475. Not equal to 92/585 ≈ 0.157. Not a solution.

Let me try x = 0, which is allowed (since denominators are 5*2*(-4), 9*4*(-6), 13*6*(-8), none of which are zero). Plugging x = 0 into the equation:

First term: (0 + 1)(0 - 3)/(5*(0 + 2)(0 - 4)) = (1*(-3))/(5*2*(-4)) = (-3)/(5*2*(-4)) = (-3)/(-40) = 3/40

Convert to common denominator. Let's see, 40, 72, 312. Prime factors:

40 = 2^3 * 5

72 = 2^3 * 3^2

312 = 8 * 39 = 8 * 3 * 13 = 2^3 * 3 * 13

So LCM would be 2^3 * 3^2 * 5 * 13 = 8 * 9 * 5 * 13 = 8*9=72; 72*5=360; 360*13=4680.

So convert each fraction:

3/40 = (3*117)/(40*117) = 351/4680

5/72 = (5*65)/(72*65) = 325/4680

-35/312 = (-35*15)/(312*15) = -525/4680

Adding them: 351 + 325 - 525 = (351 + 325) = 676; 676 - 525 = 151. So total is 151/4680 ≈ 0.0323. The right side is 92/585 ≈ 0.157. Not equal.

Sum: 351 + 325 -525 = (351 + 325) = 676; 676 -525 = 151. So 151/4680 ≈ 0.0323.

Wait, x=-5 is excluded because the third term's denominator is 13(x +6)(x -8). At x=-5, denominator is 13(1)(-13) = -169. Wait, no, x=-5 is not excluded. Wait, denominators are:

First term: 5(x +2)(x -4). At x=-5: 5(-3)(-9)=135.

Second term: 9(x +4)(x -6). At x=-5: 9(-1)(-11)=99.

Third term: 13(x +6)(x -8). At x=-5: 13(1)(-13)=-169.

So x=-5 is allowed. Let me check x=-5:

First term: (-5 +1)(-5 -3)/[5(-5 +2)(-5 -4)] = (-4)(-8)/(5*(-3)(-9)) = 32/(5*27) = 32/135 ≈ 0.237

Second term: (-5 +3)(-5 -5)/[9(-5 +4)(-5 -6)] = (-2)(-10)/(9*(-1)(-11)) = 20/(9*11) = 20/99 ≈ 0.202

Third term: -2(-5 +5)(-5 -7)/[13(-5 +6)(-5 -8)] = -2(0)(-12)/[13*(1)(-13)] = 0.

So total left side: 0.237 + 0.202 - 0 = 0.439. 92/585 ≈ 0.157, so not equal. So x=-5 is not a root.

How about x= -7:

First term: (-7 +1)(-7 -3)/[5*(-7 +2)(-7 -4)] = (-6)(-10)/(5*(-5)(-11)) = 60/(5*55) = 60/275 ≈ 0.218

Second term: (-7 +3)(-7 -5)/[9*(-7 +4)(-7 -6)] = (-4)(-12)/(9*(-3)(-13)) = 48/(9*39) = 48/351 ≈ 0.137

Third term: -2*(-7 +5)(-7 -7)/[13*(-7 +6)(-7 -8)] = -2*(-2)(-14)/[13*(-1)(-15)] = -2*(28)/(13*15) = -56/195 ≈ -0.288

Total left side: 0.218 + 0.137 - 0.288 ≈ 0.067. Not equal to 0.157. Close, but not quite.

Hmm. Maybe x= -1:

First term: (-1 +1)(-1 -3)/[5*(-1 +2)(-1 -4)] = (0)(-4)/[5*(1)(-5)] = 0.

Second term: (-1 +3)(-1 -5)/[9*(-1 +4)(-1 -6)] = (2)(-6)/[9*(3)(-7)] = (-12)/(-189) = 4/63 ≈ 0.063

Third term: -2*(-1 +5)(-1 -7)/[13*(-1 +6)(-1 -8)] = -2*(4)(-8)/[13*(5)(-9)] = -2*(-32)/(-585) = 64/(-585) ≈ -0.110

Total left side: 0 + 0.063 -0.110 ≈ -0.047. Not equal.

x= -2 is excluded. x=4 excluded. x=6 excluded. x=8 excluded. So maybe trying other integers.

How about x=10:

First term: (11)(7)/(5*12*6) = 77/(5*72) = 77/360 ≈ 0.214

Second term: (13)(5)/(9*14*16) = 65/(9*224) ≈ 65/2016 ≈ 0.032

Third term: -2*(15)(3)/(13*16*18) = -2*45/(13*288) = -90/3744 ≈ -0.024

Total left side: 0.214 + 0.032 -0.024 ≈ 0.222. 92/585 ≈ 0.157. Not equal.

Hmm. Maybe x= -9:

First term: (-8)(-12)/(5*(-11)(-13)) = 96/(5*143) ≈ 96/715 ≈ 0.134

Second term: (-6)(-14)/(9*(-10)(-15)) = 84/(9*150) = 84/1350 ≈ 0.062

Third term: -2*(-4)(-16)/(13*(-3)(-17)) = -2*(64)/(13*51) = -128/663 ≈ -0.193

Total left side: 0.134 + 0.062 -0.193 ≈ 0.003. That's very close to zero, but not 92/585. Maybe x= -9 is a root? Wait, 0.003 is approximately 0.003, but 92/585 ≈ 0.157. So no, not close enough.

Alternatively, maybe x= -10:

First term: (-9)(-13)/(5*(-12)(-14)) = 117/(5*168) = 117/840 ≈ 0.139

Second term: (-7)(-15)/(9*(-11)(-16)) = 105/(9*176) ≈ 105/1584 ≈ 0.066

Third term: -2*(-5)(-17)/(13*(-4)(-18)) = -2*(85)/(13*72) = -170/936 ≈ -0.182

Total left side: 0.139 + 0.066 -0.182 ≈ 0.023. Still not close.

This trial and error method is tedious. Maybe there's a better way. Let me think.

Looking at the equation, maybe cross-multiplying to eliminate denominators. Let's try that.
</execution_3.9>
</Execution_3>

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3:
Let's try to simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by the common denominator. But first, let's write the equation again:

\[
\frac{(x+1)(x-3)}{5(x+2)(x-4)} + \frac{(x+3)(x-5)}{9(x+4)(x-6)} - \frac{2(x+5)(x-7)}{13(x+6)(x-8)} = \frac{92}{585}
\]

Multiply both sides by 5*9*13*(x+2)(x-4)(x+4)(x-6)(x+6)(x-8). That's a huge expression, but let's do it step by step.

First term: [ (x+1)(x-3) / (5(x+2)(x-4)) ] * [5*9*13*(x+2)(x-4)(x+4)(x-6)(x+2)(x-4)(x+6)(x-8) ]

The 5 in the denominator cancels with the 5 in the numerator. Similarly, (x+2)(x-4) cancels. What remains is:

(x+1)(x-3) * 9*13*(x+4)(x-6)(x+2)(x-4)(x+6)(x-8)

Similarly for the second term:

[ (x+3)(x-5) / (9(x+4)(x-6)) ] * [5*9*13*(x+2)(x-4)(x+4)(x-6)(x+6)(x-8) ]

The 9 cancels with 9, and (x+4)(x-6) cancels. What remains:

(x+3)(x-5) *5*13*(x+2)(x-4)(x+6)(x-8)

Third term:

[ -2(x+5)(x-7) / (13(x+6)(x-8)) ] * [5*9*13*(x+2)(x-4)(x+6)(x-6)(x+6)(x-8) ]

The 13 cancels, and (x+6)(x-8) cancels. What remains:

-2(x+5)(x-7) *5*9*(x+2)(x-4)(x+6)(x-8)

<Plan_5>
Based on execution_4:
This seems very complex, but let's proceed step by step.
So after expanding all terms and moving 92/585 to the left side, we have:

[ (x+1)(x-3) * 117 * (x+4)(x-6)(x+2)(x-4)(x+6)(x-8) ] + [ (x+3)(x-5) * 65 * (x+2)(x-4)(x+6)(x-8) ] - [ 2*45*(x+5)(x-7) ] - 92/585 = 0

But this is still a very high-degree equation. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this. Alternatively, perhaps there's a substitution or factorization that can simplify the equation.

Alternatively, maybe the left-hand side can be combined into a single fraction by finding a common denominator, even though it's tedious. Let's attempt that.

The denominators are:

First term: 5(x + 2)(x - 4)

Second term: 9(x + 4)(x - 6)

Third term: 13(x + 6)(x - 8)

The denominators are all different, so the common denominator would be the product of all three denominators: 5*9*13*(x + 2)(x - 4)(x + 4)(x - 6)(x + 6)(x - 8). That's a very high-degree polynomial, but perhaps necessary.

So, to combine the fractions:

Multiply each term by the common denominator divided by their respective denominators:

First term: (x + 1)(x - 3) * 9*13*(x + 4)(x - 6)(x + 2)(x - 4)(x + 6)(x - 8)

Second term: (x + 3)(x - 5) *5*13*(x + 2)(x - 4)(x + 6)(x - 8)

Third term: -2(x + 5)(x - 7)*5*9*(x + 2)(x - 4)(x + 6)(x - 8)

= 92/585

Wait, but this seems very complicated. Maybe there's a better approach. Let me check if the equation can be transformed in some way.

Alternatively, perhaps cross-multiplying step by step. Let me try to combine the first two terms first, then combine with the third term.

First, combine the first two terms:

[ (x + 1)(x - 3) / (5(x + 2)(x - 4)) ] + [ (x + 3)(x - 5) / (9(x + 4)(x - 6)) ] = 92/585 + [ 2(x + 5)(x - 7) / (13(x + 6)(x - 8)) ]

But this might not help much. Alternatively, perhaps moving all terms to one side and combining:

[First term] + [Second term] - [Third term] - 92/585 = 0

But again, this leads back to the previous approach.

Alternatively, maybe factor each numerator and denominator to see if there's any cancellation or simplification.

First term numerator: (x + 1)(x - 3)

Denominator: 5(x + 2)(x - 4)

Second term numerator: (x + 3)(x - 5)

Denominator: 9(x + 4)(x - 6)

Third term numerator: -2(x + 5)(x - 7)

Denominator: 13(x + 6)(x - 8)

None of these factorizations seem to overlap, so no cancellation occurs. Therefore, combining them would require a common denominator.

Alternatively, maybe there's a symmetry or substitution that can simplify the equation. Let me check if substituting y = x + something could help, but it's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps noticing that the denominators are structured as (x + a)(x + b). Maybe substituting t = x + something, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps considering that the equation is a rational function set to a constant. The left-hand side is a sum of three rational functions. The right-hand side is a constant. Therefore, the left-hand side minus the right-hand side equals zero. So, if we can express the left-hand side as a single rational function, then set numerator equal to zero.

But given the complexity, maybe there's a trick here. Let me check the problem again. The equation is:

\[
\frac{(x+1)(x-3)}{5(x+2)(x-4)} + \frac{(x+3)(x-5)}{9(x+4)(x-6)} - \frac{2(x+5)(x-7)}{13(x+6)(x-8)} = \frac{92}{585}.
\]

Maybe there's a common substitution. Let me check if substituting y = x + k for some k would simplify the terms. Alternatively, perhaps noticing that the denominators have pairs of terms: (x+2)(x-4), (x+4)(x-6), (x+6)(x-8). These are consecutive even numbers shifted by 2 each time. Maybe substituting z = x +6? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps considering that each denominator is of the form (x + 2n)(x + 2n - 2) for n=1,2,3. So maybe a substitution like t = x +6? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe noticing that each numerator is (x + a)(x + b) where a and b are odd and even numbers. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps multiplying both sides by 585 to eliminate denominators on the right. Wait, the right-hand side is 92/585. So if I multiply both sides by 585, I get:

585*[ left side ] = 92.

So:

585*[ first term + second term - third term ] = 92.

But even so, this would require expanding each term as before.

Alternatively, maybe the left-hand side simplifies to a constant function. Let me check. Suppose we assume that the left-hand side is a constant. Let me test with x=0 and x=1 and see if the left-hand side is the same.

At x=0, we found approximately 0.0323. At x=1, approximately 0.0475. So no, it's not a constant. Therefore, the equation is non-trivial.
