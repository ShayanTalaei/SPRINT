Okay, so I need to find the value of c that makes the radius of the circle given by the equation x² - 10x + y² + 6y + c = 0 equal to 1. Hmm, let me remember how to do this. I think the general equation of a circle is something like (x - h)² + (y - k)² = r², where (h, k) is the center and r is the radius. The given equation doesn't look like that standard form, so I probably need to complete the squares for both x and y terms to rewrite it in the standard form.

Let me start by rearranging the equation.
First, group the x terms and y terms together.

So, x² - 10x + y² + 6y = -c. That way, I can complete the square for x and y separately.

Starting with the x terms: x² - 10x.
To complete the square, I take the coefficient of x, which is -10, divide by 2 to get -5, and then square it, which gives 25. So, x² - 10x can be written as (x - 5)² - 25.

Similarly, for the y terms: y² + 6y.
The coefficient of y is 6. Dividing by 2 gives 3, squaring it gives 9. So, y² + 6y can be written as (y + 3)² - 9. Wait, because it's y² + 6y, so actually, it's (y + 3)² - 9. Right.

So substituting these back into the equation:

Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by using the general form of the circle equation: x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F = 0, where the center is (-D/2, -E/2) and the radius is √[(D/2)² + (E/2)² - F]. Let's try that method to cross-verify.

<execution_1.1>
(x - 5)² - 25 + (y + 3)² - 9 = -c

Combine the constants on the left side: -25 - 9 is -34. So,

(x - 5)² + (y + 3)² - 34 = -c

Move the -34 to the other side:

(x - 5)² + (y + 3)² = -c + 34

But in the standard form, the right side is r². So, comparing to (x - h)² + (y - k)² = r², we have r² = 34 - c.

But we want the radius r to be 1. Therefore, r² = 1² = 1. So,

34 - c = 1

Solving for c:

c = 34 - 1 = 33

Wait, is that right? Let me check my steps again.

<execution_1.2>
Comparing the given equation x² -10x + y² +6y +c =0 with the general form, we have D = -10, E = 6, and F = c.

The radius formula is √[(D/2)² + (E/2)² - F]. Plugging in the values:

Radius = √[(-10/2)² + (6/2)² - c] = √[(-5)² + (3)² - c] = √[25 +9 -c] = √[34 -c].

We want the radius to be 1, so:

√[34 - c] = 1.

Squaring both sides:

34 - c = 1.

Therefore, -c = 1 -34 => -c = -33 => c =33.

Based on execution_1.1:
Original equation: x² -10x + y² +6y +c =0.

Completing the squares:

<prompt_2.1> Re-evaluate the steps to ensure the solution for c is correct. </prompt_2.1>

Based on execution_1.2:
Wait, so both methods lead to the same answer. That's reassuring.
So I think c=33 is correct. Let me just make sure there's no sign errors or arithmetic mistakes. Let's redo the completing the square method once again:

<prompt_2.2> Reconfirm the solution for c using both methods and ensure no errors were made. </prompt_2.2>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
For x: coefficient is -10, half of that is -5, square is 25. So (x -5)² -25.

For y: coefficient is 6, half is 3, square is 9. So (y +3)² -9. Wait, because it's y² +6y, which is (y +3)^2 -9.

So substituting:

(x -5)² -25 + (y +3)² -9 + c =0.

Wait, hold on. The original equation is x² -10x + y² +6y +c=0. After completing the squares, we have (x -5)² -25 + (y +3)² -9 +c=0. Then, combining constants: -25 -9 +c = -34 +c. So the equation becomes (x -5)² + (y +3)² + (c -34) =0. Moving the constant to the other side: (x -5)² + (y +3)² = 34 - c.

Yes, so the right-hand side is 34 - c, which equals r². Since r=1, 34 - c =1, so c=33.

x² -10x + y² +6y +c =0.

Group x and y terms:

x² -10x + y² +6y = -c.

Complete the square for x: x² -10x. Take half of -10, get -5. Square it, 25. So add and subtract 25:

(x² -10x +25 -25) + (y² +6y) = -c.

Similarly for y: y² +6y. Half of 6 is 3. Square is 9. So add and subtract 9:

(x² -10x +25) -25 + (y² +6y +9) -9 = -c.

Which becomes:

(x -5)^2 -25 + (y +3)^2 -9 = -c.

Combine constants: -25 -9 = -34.

So (x -5)^2 + (y +3)^2 -34 = -c.

Bring -34 to the other side:

(x -5)^2 + (y +3)^2 = 34 -c.

So right-hand side is 34 -c, which equals r². Given r=1, so 34 -c=1, hence c=33.
