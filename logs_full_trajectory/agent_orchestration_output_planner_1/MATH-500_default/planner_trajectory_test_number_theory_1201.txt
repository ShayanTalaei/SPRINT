Okay, let's try to figure out how many of the first 100 positive integers are divisible by 3, 4, and 5. Hmm, so the question is asking for numbers that are divisible by all three of these numbers. Divisible by 3, 4, and 5. 

First, I remember that if a number is divisible by multiple numbers, we can find the least common multiple (LCM) of those numbers, and then count how many multiples of the LCM are there up to 100. That makes sense because the LCM is the smallest number that is divisible by each of the numbers, and then every multiple of the LCM after that will also be divisible by all of them.

So, let's start by finding the LCM of 3, 4, and 5.

<prompt_1.1> Use the above plan to find the LCM of 3, 4, and 5. </prompt_1.1>

<execution_1.1>
To find the LCM, I can break each number down into its prime factors:

- 3 is already a prime number, so its prime factorization is 3.
- 4 can be broken down into 2 x 2, which is 2².
- 5 is also a prime number, so its prime factorization is 5.

The LCM is the product of the highest power of each prime number present in the factorizations. So, the primes here are 2, 3, and 5. The highest power of 2 is 2² from 4, the highest power of 3 is 3¹ from 3, and the highest power of 5 is 5¹ from 5. Therefore, the LCM should be 2² x 3 x 5.

Based on execution_1.1:
Let me calculate that: 2² is 4, 4 x 3 is 12, and 12 x 5 is 60. So, the LCM of 3, 4, and 5 is 60.

That means 60 is the smallest number divisible by 3, 4, and 5. Then, the next numbers would be 60 x 2 = 120, 60 x 3 = 180, and so on. But since we're only looking at the first 100 positive integers, which are from 1 to 100, let's see how many multiples of 60 are in this range.

<prompt_2.1> Determine how many multiples of 60 are within the range of 1 to 100. </prompt_2.1>

Alternatively, maybe I can check by listing the numbers divisible by 3, 4, and 5 within 1-100. Let's see.

<prompt_2.2> List numbers between 1 and 100 that are divisible by 3, 4, and 5. </prompt_2.2>

<execution_2.1>
The multiples of 60 are 60, 120, 180, etc. But 120 is already larger than 100, so the only multiple of 60 in the first 100 numbers is 60 itself.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Numbers divisible by 3 between 1-100: 3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24,27,30,....,99.

Numbers divisible by 4: 4,8,12,16,20,....,100.

Numbers divisible by 5: 5,10,15,20,....,100.

The common numbers would need to be divisible by 3, 4, and 5. So, looking for numbers that appear in all three lists. But listing all of them would take time. Alternatively, since we know that the LCM is 60, the numbers should be 60 and 120, but 120 is beyond 100, so only 60. Hence, confirming again, there's only one number.

Based on execution_2.1:
Wait, but let me double-check. Let me verify if 60 is indeed divisible by 3, 4, and 5.

<prompt_3.1> Verify if 60 is divisible by 3, 4, and 5. </prompt_3.1>

Based on execution_2.2:
Alternatively, maybe there's another way. Let's think about the problem again. If a number is divisible by 3, 4, and 5, then it must be divisible by each of them. So, for a number to be divisible by 4 and 2 (since 3 and 5 are coprime, but 4 is 2²), but wait, maybe that's complicating.

<prompt_3.2> Consider and compare different methods to confirm the solution. </prompt_3.2>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
Dividing 60 by 3 gives 20, which is an integer. 60 divided by 4 is 15, also an integer. 60 divided by 5 is 12, which is an integer. So yes, 60 is divisible by all three. Then the next multiple would be 60 x 2 = 120, which is outside the range. Therefore, only 60 is in the first 100 numbers.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
Wait, actually, since 4 is 2², and 3 and 5 are primes, the LCM is indeed 2² x 3 x 5 = 60. So, any number divisible by 60 is divisible by 3, 4, and 5. Therefore, in the first 100 numbers, only 60 and 120, but 120 is out of range. So, only one number.
</execution_3.2>

<Final_answer>
Therefore, the number of the first one hundred positive integers that are divisible by $3$, $4$, and $5$ is $\boxed{1}$.
