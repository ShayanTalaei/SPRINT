Okay, so I need to find the product CD where C and D are integers that satisfy the equation:

C/(x - 3) + D/(x + 8) = (4x - 23)/(x² + 5x - 24)

Alright, let me start by understanding what this equation is saying. On the left side, there are two fractions with denominators (x - 3) and (x + 8). The right side is a single rational expression. The denominators on the left and right must be related. Let me check the denominator on the right: x² + 5x - 24.

Hmm, maybe that factors into (x - 3)(x + 8)?

Let me verify.
If I expand (x - 3)(x + 8), I get x² + 8x - 3x - 24 = x² + 5x - 24.

Yes, that's correct. So the denominator on the right factors into (x - 3)(x + 8), which are the same denominators as on the left. That makes sense. So this is a case of partial fractions, where we can express the right-hand side as a sum of two fractions with linear denominators.

The original equation is:

C/(x - 3) + D/(x + 8) = (4x - 23)/[(x - 3)(x + 8)]

To combine the left side into a single fraction, we need a common denominator, which is (x - 3)(x + 8). So:

<prompt_1.1> Combine the left side into a single fraction and equate it to the right side. </prompt_1.1>

Maybe I should check if there's another method, just to confirm.

Alternatively, we can use the method of equating coefficients. Let me try that.

<prompt_1.2> Use the method of equating coefficients to solve for C and D. </prompt_1.2>

Alternatively, another method is to plug in specific values for x to compute C and D. For example, if we set x = 3, then the term with D becomes undefined, but the equation becomes:

Similarly, setting x = -8:

<execution_1.1>
C(x + 8) + D(x - 3) all over (x - 3)(x + 8) equals (4x - 23)/[(x - 3)(x + 8)]

Since the denominators are the same, the numerators must be equal:

C(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = 4x - 23
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
Starting from:

C/(x - 3) + D/(x + 8) = (4x -23)/[(x -3)(x +8)]

Multiply both sides by (x -3)(x +8):

C(x +8) + D(x -3) = 4x -23

Expand the left side:

C x + 8C + D x -3D = (C + D)x + (8C -3D)

This must equal 4x -23. Therefore, we can set up a system of equations by equating the coefficients:

1. Coefficient of x: C + D = 4
2. Constant term: 8C -3D = -23

So now we have:

C + D = 4

8C -3D = -23

Let me solve this system. From the first equation, D = 4 - C. Substitute into the second equation:

8C -3(4 - C) = -23

8C -12 +3C = -23

11C -12 = -23

11C = -11

C = -1

Then D = 4 - (-1) = 5. So same result. Therefore, CD = (-1)(5) = -5.

<execution_1.3>
C/(3 - 3) + D/(3 + 8) = (4*3 - 23)/[(3 - 3)(3 + 8)]

But the left side has C/0, which is undefined, but the right side numerator is 12 - 23 = -11, and denominator is 0*11 = 0. So, actually, the original equation is not defined at x = 3 or x = -8, but if we take the limit as x approaches 3, we can find C by substituting x = 3 into the numerator after multiplying both sides by (x - 3)(x + 8):

Original equation:

C/(x - 3) + D/(x + 8) = (4x -23)/[(x - 3)(x + 8)]

Multiply both sides by (x - 3)(x + 8):

C(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = 4x -23

Now, substitute x = 3:

C(3 + 8) + D(3 - 3) = 4*3 -23

So, 11C + 0 = 12 -23 = -11

Therefore, 11C = -11 => C = -1
</execution_1.3>

<execution_1.4>
Left side: D/(-8 + 8) is undefined, but the original equation would have:

C/0 + D/(-8 +8) = something, but that's not helpful. However, if we consider the original equation:

Multiply both sides by (x - 3)(x + 8):

C(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = 4x -23

Then, if we substitute x = 3:

C(3 + 8) + D(3 -3) = 4*3 -23

So, 11C + 0 = 12 -23 = -11 => 11C = -11 => C = -1

Similarly, substitute x = -8:

C(-8 +8) + D(-8 -3) = 4*(-8) -23

So, 0 + D*(-11) = -32 -23 = -55

Thus, -11D = -55 => D = 5

Based on execution_1.1:
Now, we need to find constants C and D such that this equation holds for all x except 3 and -8. To find C and D, we can expand the left side and equate coefficients, or we can choose specific values for x to simplify the equation.

Let me try both methods.

<prompt_2.1> Solve for C and D by choosing specific values for x and verify the solution. </prompt_2.1>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
First, expanding the left side:

C(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = Cx + 8C + Dx - 3D

Combine like terms:

(C + D)x + (8C - 3D)

Set this equal to 4x - 23.

So, the coefficients of like terms must be equal. That gives us a system of equations:

1. Coefficient of x: C + D = 4

2. Constant term: 8C - 3D = -23

Alternatively, we can choose specific values for x to create equations for C and D. Since the equation must hold for all x except 3 and -8, we can pick convenient values for x that simplify the equation.

For example, if we let x = 3, then the term with (x - 3) becomes zero, which might simplify the equation. Let's try x = 3:

Substitute x = 3 into the equation C(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = 4x - 23:

C(3 + 8) + D(3 - 3) = 4*3 - 23

Simplify:

C(11) + D(0) = 12 - 23

So, 11C = -11

Divide both sides by 11:

C = -1

Now that we have C = -1, we can substitute back into the first equation (C + D = 4):

-1 + D = 4

So, D = 4 + 1 = 5

Therefore, C = -1 and D = 5. The product CD is (-1)(5) = -5.

Based on execution_2.1:
Wait, let me check if this is correct by substituting back into the original equation.

<prompt_3.1> Substitute C and D back into the original equation to verify the solution. </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
Let's verify that C = -1 and D = 5 satisfy the equation:

Left side: (-1)/(x - 3) + 5/(x + 8)

Combine these fractions:

[ -1(x + 8) + 5(x - 3) ] / [(x - 3)(x + 8)]

Expand the numerator:

-1*x -1*8 + 5*x -5*3 = (-x -8) + (5x -15) = (-x + 5x) + (-8 -15) = 4x -23

Which matches the right side numerator: 4x -23.
