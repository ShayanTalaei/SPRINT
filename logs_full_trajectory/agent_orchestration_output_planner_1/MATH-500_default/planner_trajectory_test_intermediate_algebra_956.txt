Okay, so I need to find the ordered triple (p, q, r) such that the polynomial x³ - 3x² + 4x - 1 is a factor of x⁹ + p x⁶ + q x³ + r. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

<prompt_1.1> Determine the relationship between the given polynomial and the polynomial x⁹ + px⁶ + qx³ + r. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
First, if x³ - 3x² + 4x - 1 is a factor of the given polynomial, then any root of x³ - 3x² + 4x - 1 = 0 must also be a root of x⁹ + p x⁶ + q x³ + r = 0. That means if α is a root of the cubic, then it should satisfy the equation x⁹ + p x⁶ + q x³ + r = 0. So, maybe I can use the fact that x⁹ can be expressed in terms of lower powers of x using the original cubic equation. Since α³ - 3α² + 4α - 1 = 0, we can write α³ = 3α² - 4α + 1. Then, higher powers of α can be reduced using this relation. So perhaps I can express α⁹ in terms of α² and α, and then substitute back into the equation α⁹ + p α⁶ + q α³ + r = 0, which should equal zero. Then, equate coefficients to find p, q, r.

Alternatively, since the given polynomial is a ninth-degree polynomial with only x⁹, x⁶, x³, and constant terms, and the cubic is a factor, maybe there's a way to factor the ninth-degree polynomial as (x³ - 3x² + 4x - 1) times some sixth-degree polynomial, and then compare coefficients. But that might be more involved. The first approach using reduction of powers seems more manageable.

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Let me try the first approach. Let α be a root of x³ - 3x² + 4x - 1 = 0.

<prompt_2.1> Use the relation α³ = 3α² - 4α + 1 to express higher powers of α in terms of lower powers. </prompt_2.1>
-----

But let me check if this is correct. Let's verify by substituting α into the polynomial.

<prompt_2.2> Verify the solution by substituting α into the polynomial x⁹ + p x⁶ + q x³ + r and checking if it equals zero. </prompt_2.2>

But wait, let me check if there's another way to approach this problem. For example, using polynomial division.

<prompt_2.3> Consider using polynomial division as an alternative method to verify the solution. </prompt_2.3>

Alternatively, if we consider that the given polynomial x⁹ + p x⁶ + q x³ + r can be written as (x³)^3 + p (x³)^2 + q (x³) + r. Let me denote y = x³.
Then the polynomial becomes y³ + p y² + q y + r. If x³ - 3x² + 4x -1 is a factor of this polynomial, then perhaps y³ + p y² + q y + r is divisible by y - (3x² -4x +1)? Wait, not sure. Wait, since y = x³, maybe there's a substitution here.

Alternatively, since x³ = 3x² -4x +1, then x⁹ = (x³)^3 = (3x² -4x +1)^3. Let's compute that.

<prompt_2.4> Expand (3x² - 4x + 1)^3 and express x⁹ in terms of x² and x. </prompt_2.4>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Then, α³ = 3α² - 4α + 1. I need to compute α⁹ and express it in terms of α² and α. Let's start by computing powers of α step by step:

First, α³ = 3α² - 4α + 1.

Then, α⁴ = α * α³ = α*(3α² - 4α + 1) = 3α³ - 4α² + α. But we can substitute α³ here:

= 3*(3α² - 4α + 1) - 4α² + α
= 9α² - 12α + 3 - 4α² + α
= (9α² - 4α²) + (-12α + α) + 3
= 5α² - 11α + 3

Similarly, α⁵ = α * α⁴ = α*(5α² - 11α + 3) = 5α³ - 11α² + 3α. Substitute α³ again:

= 5*(3α² - 4α + 1) - 11α² + 3α
= 15α² - 20α + 5 - 11α² + 3α
= (15α² - 11α²) + (-20α + 3α) + 5
= 4α² - 17α + 5

Next, α⁶ = α * α⁵ = α*(4α² - 17α + 5) = 4α³ - 17α² + 5α. Substitute α³:

= 4*(3α² - 4α + 1) - 17α² + 5α
= 12α² - 16α + 4 - 17α² + 5α
= (12α² - 17α²) + (-16α + 5α) + 4
= -5α² - 11α + 4

Continuing, α⁷ = α * α⁶ = α*(-5α² - 11α + 4) = -5α³ - 11α² + 4α. Substitute α³:

= -5*(3α² - 4α + 1) - 11α² + 4α
= -15α² + 20α - 5 - 11α² + 4α
= (-15α² - 11α²) + (20α + 4α) -5
= -26α² + 24α -5

α⁸ = α * α⁷ = α*(-26α² + 24α -5) = -26α³ + 24α² -5α. Substitute α³:

= -26*(3α² -4α +1) +24α² -5α
= -78α² + 104α -26 +24α² -5α
= (-78α² +24α²) + (104α -5α) -26
= -54α² +99α -26

α⁹ = α * α⁸ = α*(-54α² +99α -26) = -54α³ +99α² -26α. Substitute α³:

= -54*(3α² -4α +1) +99α² -26α
= -162α² +216α -54 +99α² -26α
= (-162α² +99α²) + (216α -26α) -54
= -63α² +190α -54

So, α⁹ + p α⁶ + q α³ + r = 0. Let's substitute the expressions we found:

α⁹ = -63α² +190α -54

p α⁶ = p*(-5α² -11α +4)

q α³ = q*(3α² -4α +1)

Adding these together with r:

(-63α² +190α -54) + p*(-5α² -11α +4) + q*(3α² -4α +1) + r = 0

Now, let's combine like terms. First, collect the α² terms:

(-63 -5p +3q) α²

Then the α terms:

(190 -11p -4q) α

Then the constant terms:

(-54 +4p + q + r)

So, the entire expression is:

[(-63 -5p +3q) α² + (190 -11p -4q) α + (-54 +4p + q + r)] = 0

Since α is a root of the cubic x³ -3x² +4x -1 =0, which is irreducible over the rationals (I think), so the minimal polynomial of α is the cubic itself. Therefore, the coefficients of α², α, and the constant term must each be zero for this equation to hold. Therefore, we have a system of equations:

1. Coefficient of α²: -63 -5p +3q = 0

2. Coefficient of α: 190 -11p -4q = 0

3. Constant term: -54 +4p + q + r = 0

So now, we have three equations with three variables p, q, r. Let me write them down:

Equation 1: -5p + 3q = 63

Equation 2: -11p -4q = -190

Equation 3: 4p + q = 54 - r

Wait, but equation 3 can be rearranged as 4p + q + r = 54. So, if we solve equations 1 and 2 for p and q, then we can substitute into equation 3 to find r.

Let me solve equations 1 and 2 first.

Equation 1: -5p + 3q = 63

Equation 2: -11p -4q = -190

Let me use the method of elimination. Let's multiply equation 1 by 4 and equation 2 by 3 to eliminate q:

Equation 1 *4: -20p +12q = 252

Equation 2 *3: -33p -12q = -570

Now, add these two equations:

(-20p -33p) + (12q -12q) = 252 -570

-53p = -318

Therefore, p = (-318)/(-53) = 318/53. Let me divide 318 by 53.

53*6 = 318, so p = 6.

Now, substitute p =6 into equation 1:

-5*6 +3q =63

-30 +3q =63

3q = 93

q =31

Now, substitute p=6 and q=31 into equation 3:

4*6 +31 + r =54

24 +31 + r =54

55 + r =54

r =54 -55 = -1

Therefore, the ordered triple is (6,31,-1).

<execution_2.2>
Then, α⁹ + p α⁶ + q α³ + r should equal zero. Let's compute each term:

First, α³ = 3α² -4α +1.

α⁴ = α * α³ = α(3α² -4α +1) = 3α³ -4α² +α. But substitute α³ again: 3(3α² -4α +1) -4α² +α = 9α² -12α +3 -4α² +α = (9α² -4α²) + (-12α +α) +3 = 5α² -11α +3.

α⁵ = α * α⁴ = α(5α² -11α +3) =5α³ -11α² +3α. Substitute α³: 5(3α² -4α +1) -11α² +3α =15α² -20α +5 -11α² +3α = (15α² -11α²) + (-20α +3α) +5 =4α² -17α +5.

α⁶ = α * α⁵ = α(4α² -17α +5) =4α³ -17α² +5α. Substitute α³:4(3α² -4α +1) -17α² +5α =12α² -16α +4 -17α² +5α = (12α² -17α²) + (-16α +5α) +4 =-5α² -11α +4.

α⁷ = α * α⁶ = α(-5α² -11α +4) =-5α³ -11α² +4α. Substitute α³: -5(3α² -4α +1) -11α² +4α =-15α² +20α -5 -11α² +4α = (-15α² -11α²) + (20α +4α) -5 =-26α² +24α -5.

α⁸ = α * α⁷ = α(-26α² +24α -5) =-26α³ +24α² -5α. Substitute α³: -26(3α² -4α +1) +24α² -5α =-78α² +104α -26 +24α² -5α = (-78α² +24α²) + (104α -5α) -26 =-54α² +99α -26.

α⁹ = α * α⁸ = α(-54α² +99α -26) =-54α³ +99α² -26α. Substitute α³: -54(3α² -4α +1) +99α² -26α =-162α² +216α -54 +99α² -26α = (-162α² +99α²) + (216α -26α) -54 =-63α² +190α -54.

So, α⁹ + p α⁶ + q α³ + r = (-63α² +190α -54) + p(-5α² -11α +4) + q(3α² -4α +1) + r.

Let's expand this:

First, expand each term:

-63α² +190α -54

+ p*(-5α² -11α +4) = -5p α² -11p α +4p

+ q*(3α² -4α +1) = 3q α² -4q α +q

+ r.

Now, combine like terms:

α² terms: (-63 -5p +3q) α²

α terms: (190 -11p -4q) α

constants: (-54 +4p +q +r)

Since this must equal zero for all α that are roots of the cubic, the coefficients of α², α, and the constant term must each be zero. Therefore, we have the system of equations:

1. -63 -5p +3q = 0

2. 190 -11p -4q = 0

3. -54 +4p +q +r = 0

So now, we need to solve this system for p, q, r.

Let me write the equations again:

Equation 1: -5p +3q = 63

Equation 2: -11p -4q = -190

Equation 3: 4p + q = 54 - r

Wait, equation 3 can be rearranged as 4p + q + r = 54, so r = 54 -4p -q.

So first, solve equations 1 and 2 for p and q, then substitute into equation 3 to find r.

Let's solve equations 1 and 2:

Equation 1: -5p +3q = 63

Equation 2: -11p -4q = -190

Let me use the method of elimination. Multiply equation 1 by 4 and equation 2 by 3 to eliminate q:

Equation 1 *4: -20p +12q = 252

Equation 2 *3: -33p -12q = -570

Now add these two equations:

(-20p -33p) + (12q -12q) = 252 -570

-53p = -318

Therefore, p = (-318)/(-53) = 318/53. Let's divide 318 by 53.

53*6 = 318, so p = 6.

Now substitute p =6 into equation 1:

-5*6 +3q =63 => -30 +3q =63 => 3q =93 => q=31.

So p=6, q=31. Then, substitute into equation 3:

4*6 +31 +r =54 =>24 +31 +r =54 =>55 +r=54 =>r=54 -55= -1.

Therefore, the ordered triple is (6,31,-1).

If x³ - 3x² + 4x -1 is a factor of x⁹ + p x⁶ + q x³ + r, then when we divide the ninth-degree polynomial by the cubic, the quotient should be a sixth-degree polynomial, and the remainder should be zero. But performing polynomial long division might be tedious. Alternatively, using the fact that if α is a root of the cubic, then substituting α into the ninth-degree polynomial should yield zero. Which is what I did earlier.
</execution_2.3>

<execution_2.4>
Hmm, that might be a way. Let's try expanding (3x² -4x +1)^3.

First, (a + b + c)^3 = a³ + b³ + c³ + 3a²b + 3a²c + 3b²a + 3b²c + 3c²a + 3c²b + 6abc. But maybe it's easier to do step by step.

Let me compute (3x² -4x +1)*(3x² -4x +1) first.

Multiply term by term:

First multiply 3x² by each term of the second polynomial: 3x²*3x² = 9x⁴, 3x²*(-4x) = -12x³, 3x²*1 = 3x².

Next, multiply -4x by each term: -4x*3x² = -12x³, -4x*(-4x) = 16x², -4x*1 = -4x.

Then multiply 1 by each term: 1*3x² = 3x², 1*(-4x) = -4x, 1*1 = 1.

Now, add all those up:

9x⁴ -12x³ +3x² -12x³ +16x² -4x +3x² -4x +1.

Combine like terms:

x⁴: 9x⁴

x³: -12x³ -12x³ = -24x³

x²: 3x² +16x² +3x² = 22x²

x: -4x -4x = -8x

Constants: 1

So, (3x² -4x +1)^2 = 9x⁴ -24x³ +22x² -8x +1.

Now, multiply this by (3x² -4x +1) to get (3x² -4x +1)^3.

So, multiply each term in 9x⁴ -24x³ +22x² -8x +1 by each term in 3x² -4x +1.

Let's do this step by step.

First, multiply 9x⁴ by each term in the second polynomial:

9x⁴ *3x² = 27x⁶

9x⁴*(-4x) = -36x⁵

9x⁴*1 = 9x⁴

Next, multiply -24x³ by each term:

-24x³*3x² = -72x⁵

-24x³*(-4x) = 96x⁴

-24x³*1 = -24x³

Next, multiply 22x² by each term:

22x²*3x² = 66x⁴

22x²*(-4x) = -88x³

22x²*1 = 22x²

Next, multiply -8x by each term:

-8x*3x² = -24x³

-8x*(-4x) = 32x²

-8x*1 = -8x

Finally, multiply 1 by each term:

1*3x² = 3x²

1*(-4x) = -4x

1*1 = 1

Now, collect all the terms:

x⁶: 27x⁶

x⁵: -36x⁵ -72x⁵ = -108x⁵

x⁴: 9x⁴ +96x⁴ +66x⁴ = 171x⁴

x³: -24x³ -88x³ -24x³ = -136x³

x²: 22x² +32x² +3x² = 57x²

x: -8x -4x = -12x

Constants: 1

So, (3x² -4x +1)^3 = 27x⁶ -108x⁵ +171x⁴ -136x³ +57x² -12x +1.

Therefore, x⁹ = 27x⁶ -108x⁵ +171x⁴ -136x³ +57x² -12x +1.

But in the given polynomial x⁹ + p x⁶ + q x³ + r, the coefficients for x⁵, x⁴, x², x are all zero. So substituting x⁹ from above into the given polynomial:

x⁹ + p x⁶ + q x³ + r = (27x⁶ -108x⁵ +171x⁴ -136x³ +57x² -12x +1) + p x⁶ + q x³ + r.

Combine like terms:

x⁵: -108x⁵

x⁴: 171x⁴

x³: -136x³ + q x³

x²: 57x²

x: -12x

Constants: 1 + r

But since the original polynomial is supposed to be divisible by x³ -3x² +4x -1, which means that for any root α of the cubic, α⁹ + p α⁶ + q α³ + r = 0. However, when we reduced α⁹, we found that it's equal to 27α⁶ -108α⁵ +171α⁴ -136α³ +57α² -12α +1. Then, substituting into the polynomial, we get the expression above. But since α is a root of the cubic, we can reduce higher powers of α (like α⁵, α⁴) in terms of lower powers. So maybe we need to express α⁵ and α⁴ in terms of α² and α.

Wait, maybe this approach is getting too complicated. Let me check if my initial approach was correct.

Alternatively, perhaps since the cubic divides the ninth-degree polynomial, then the ninth-degree polynomial can be written as (x³ -3x² +4x -1) times some sixth-degree polynomial. Let's denote the sixth-degree polynomial as ax⁶ + bx⁵ + cx⁴ + dx³ + ex² + fx + g. Then, multiplying out, we can equate coefficients with x⁹ + p x⁶ + q x³ + r. But this might take a while, but let's try.

Based on execution_2.1, execution_2.2:
But let me verify once more to be sure. Let's compute α⁹ +6α⁶ +31α³ -1.

Given that α³ =3α² -4α +1.

First, compute α⁶: we found earlier that α⁶ = -5α² +4.

Compute α⁹: we found α⁹ = -63α² +190α -54.

So, α⁹ +6α⁶ +31α³ -1 = (-63α² +190α -54) +6*(-5α² +4) +31*(3α² -4α +1) -1

Let's compute each term:

First term: -63α² +190α -54

Second term: 6*(-5α² +4) = -30α² +24

Third term: 31*(3α² -4α +1) =93α² -124α +31

Now, combine all terms:

α² terms: -63α² -30α² +93α² = 0α²

α terms:190α -124α =66α

Constants: -54 +24 +31 -1 = (-54 +24) + (31 -1) = (-30) +30 =0

So, total expression is 0α² +66α +0 =66α. Wait, that's not zero. Hmm, this is a problem. Did I make a mistake here?

Wait, but we had earlier that α⁹ +p α⁶ +q α³ +r =0, which after substitution gave us the coefficients for α², α, and constants. But according to this calculation, when p=6, q=31, r=-1, we get α⁹ +6α⁶ +31α³ -1 =66α, which is not zero. That suggests an error in our approach.

But this contradicts the previous result where we set coefficients to zero. What's the issue here?
