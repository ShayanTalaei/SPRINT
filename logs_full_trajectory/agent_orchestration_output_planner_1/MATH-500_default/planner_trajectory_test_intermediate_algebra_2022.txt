Let $(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n)$ be a sequence of positive real numbers, such that
\[\sum_{i = 1}^n a_i = 96, \quad \sum_{i = 1}^n a_i^2 = 144, \quad \sum_{i = 1}^n a_i^3 = 216.\]Find the sum of all possible values of $n.$

<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to find the sum of all possible values of n given the three conditions on the sequence of positive real numbers. Let me start by writing down the given information:

We have a sequence (a₁, a₂, …, aₙ) where each a_i is a positive real number. The three sums are:

1. The sum of the numbers: ∑a_i = 96
2. The sum of their squares: ∑a_i² = 144
3. The sum of their cubes: ∑a_i³ = 216

And we need to find all possible values of n and then sum them up.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe using inequalities like Cauchy-Schwarz or Hölder's inequality? Or perhaps considering the case where all a_i are equal? Let me check that first.

<prompt_1.1> Consider the case where all a_i are equal and find the possible value of n. </prompt_1.1>
-----

But wait, maybe there are other possible n? For example, maybe not all a_i are equal, but some are different. Let me check if that's possible.

Suppose that not all a_i are equal. Then, the inequalities would be strict. Let's see.

<prompt_1.2> Consider the possibility of non-equal a_i and verify if other values of n are possible. </prompt_1.2>

<execution_1.1>
If all a_i are equal, then each a_i would be 96/n. Then, the sum of squares would be n*(96/n)² = 96² / n. According to the given, this should equal 144. So:

96² / n = 144

Solving for n: n = 96² / 144. Let's compute that.

96 squared is 9216, so 9216 / 144 = 64. So n = 64. Similarly, let's check the sum of cubes. If all a_i are equal, then the sum of cubes would be n*(96/n)³ = 96³ / n². Let's compute that:

96³ = 96*96*96. Let me compute 96*96 first: 96*96 = 9216. Then 9216*96. Let me do that step by step: 9216*100 = 921600, subtract 9216*4 = 36864, so 921600 - 36864 = 884736. So 96³ = 884736. Then, 884736 / (64)² = 884736 / 4096. Let's divide: 884736 ÷ 4096. 4096*200 = 819200. Subtract that from 884736: 884736 - 819200 = 65536. 4096*16 = 65536. So total is 200 + 16 = 216. Which matches the given sum of cubes.
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
If the a_i are not all equal, then the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality would give:

(∑a_i)² < n∑a_i²

So, 96² < n*144 ⇒ 9216 < 144n ⇒ n > 64.

Similarly, Hölder's inequality would give:

(∑a_i)³ < (∑1)(∑a_i²)(∑a_i³) = n*144*216

So, 96³ < n*144*216

Calculate 96³: 96*96=9216, 9216*96=884736

144*216=31104

So, 884736 < 31104n ⇒ n > 884736 / 31104 ≈ 28.444...

So, if not all a_i are equal, n must be greater than 28.444... But since n must be an integer, n ≥ 29. But earlier, if all a_i are equal, n=64. So, if not all equal, n must be greater than 64? Wait, no. Wait, the Cauchy-Schwarz gives n > 64 if not all equal. Wait, no, hold on. Wait, when all a_i are equal, the inequalities become equalities? Wait, no.

Wait, if all a_i are equal, then ∑a_i = n*a, so a = 96/n. Then ∑a_i² = n*(96/n)^2 = 96² / n. Given that ∑a_i² = 144, so 96² / n = 144 ⇒ n = 96² / 144 = (9216)/144 = 64. So, n=64 is possible when all a_i are equal to 96/64=1.5.

If not all a_i are equal, then ∑a_i² would be greater than 96² / n (by Cauchy-Schwarz inequality). But in our case, ∑a_i² =144. So, 144 = 96² /n if and only if n=64. If n≠64, then 144 > 96² /n or 144 < 96² /n?

Wait, Cauchy-Schwarz says that (∑a_i)² ≤ n∑a_i². So, 96² ≤ n*144. Therefore, n ≥ 96² /144 = 64. So, n must be at least 64. So, n=64 is possible, and for n>64, can we have other n?

But then, if n>64, then the sum of squares would have to be at least 96² /n, which is less than 96² /64 = 144. So, if n>64, then ∑a_i² ≥ 96² /n <144. But in our problem, ∑a_i²=144. So, the only possible n is 64. Because if n>64, then the minimum possible sum of squares would be less than 144, but our sum of squares is exactly 144. Wait, but if n>64, the minimum sum of squares is 96² /n, which is less than 144, so 144 could be achieved if the numbers are not all equal. But how?

Wait, maybe there's a contradiction here. Let me think again.

If n=64, then the sum of squares is exactly 144 when all a_i are equal to 1.5. If n>64, then the minimal sum of squares would be 96² /n, which is 9216/n. If n=65, then 9216/65 ≈ 141.8, which is less than 144. So, 144 is greater than the minimal sum of squares for n=65. So, maybe with n=65, we can have some numbers larger than 1.5 and some smaller, such that the sum of squares becomes 144. Similarly for other n>64.

But then, does the sum of cubes also come into play? The sum of cubes is 216. If all a_i are equal to 96/n, then the sum of cubes would be n*(96/n)^3 = 96³ /n². Given that the sum of cubes is 216, so 96³ /n² =216 ⇒ n² =96³ /216.

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
But wait, the problem says "sum of all possible values of n". So, is 64 the only possible value? Or are there other possible n?

But before jumping to conclusions, let's verify.

Let me check if there could be other values of n.

Suppose that not all a_i are equal. Then, the inequalities would be strict.

<prompt_2.1> Verify if there could be other values of n by considering non-equal a_i. </prompt_2.1>

Based on execution_1.2:
Let's compute that.

<prompt_2.2> Compute the value of n using the equation n² = 96³ / 216 and check if it is an integer. </prompt_2.2>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
For example, Cauchy-Schwarz would become strict: (∑a_i)² < n∑a_i². Similarly, other inequalities would be strict. Let's check with our numbers.

If n=64, and all a_i are 1.5, then indeed, the sums are 96, 144, 216. But if n≠64, can we have other configurations?

Suppose n=1. Then, we have a single number a₁=96. Then, a₁²=96²=9216≠144. So n=1 is impossible.

n=2: Let's see. Suppose n=2. Then, we have two numbers a and b such that a + b =96, a² + b²=144, a³ + b³=216.

Let me check if this is possible.

From a + b =96, we have b=96 -a. Then, a² + (96 -a)² =144.

Compute (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b² =96²=9216. But a² + b²=144, so 144 + 2ab=9216 ⇒ 2ab=9216 -144=9072 ⇒ ab=4536.

Then, a³ + b³ = (a + b)^3 - 3ab(a + b) =96³ -3*4536*96.

Compute 96³=884736. Then, 3*4536*96=3*435456=1306368. So, a³ + b³=884736 -1306368= -421632. But the given sum is 216. So, impossible. Therefore, n=2 is impossible.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
First, 96³ is 96*96*96 = 884736 as before. 884736 divided by 216: 884736 ÷ 216. Let's compute that.

216*4000 = 864000. Subtract that from 884736: 884736 - 864000 = 20736. Now, 216*96 = 20736. So total is 4000 + 96 = 4096. Therefore, n² = 4096 ⇒ n = √4096 = 64. So, even if we assume all a_i equal, we get n=64. But this is under the assumption that all a_i are equal. If they are not all equal, can we have different n?

Similarly, n=64 is possible. Let's try n=3.

Based on execution_2.2:
But wait, earlier we saw that for n>64, the minimal sum of squares would be less than 144, but here, if n=64, sum of squares is exactly 144.

Let a, b, c be the numbers. Wait, no, n=3. Let a, b be the two numbers. Then, a + b =96, a² + b²=144, a³ + b³=216. Wait, similar to n=2. Let's see.

From a + b =96, ab=(96² -144)/2=(9216 -144)/2=9072/2=4536. Then, a³ + b³=(a + b)^3 -3ab(a + b)=96³ -3*4536*96. As before, this would be 884736 -1306368= -421632≠216. So, impossible. So n=3 is impossible.

n=64 is possible. How about n=24? Wait, why 24? Hmm, maybe another approach.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
But if we have n>64, say n=65, then the minimal sum of squares would be 96² /65 ≈141.8, which is less than 144. So, perhaps by having some variables larger than 1.5 and some smaller, we can achieve the sum of squares 144, and the sum of cubes 216. But is that possible?

But wait, if all variables are equal, we have a unique solution. If variables are not equal, the sum of cubes might not match. Let's check.

Suppose that not all a_i are equal. Then, the sum of cubes would be different. Let me consider two variables again. For example, n=2. But we saw that it's impossible. What about n=3?

Suppose n=3. Then, we have a + b + c =96, a² + b² + c²=144, a³ + b³ + c³=216. Let's see if this is possible.

Let me denote S1 = a + b + c =96, S2 = ab + bc + ca, S3 = abc.

We know that (a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca). So, 96² =144 + 2S2 ⇒ 9216 =144 + 2S2 ⇒ 2S2=9216 -144=9072 ⇒ S2=4536.

Then, the sum of cubes: a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc. So, 216 =96³ -3*96*4536 +3S3.

Compute 96³=884736. Then, 3*96*4536=3*435456=1306368. So, 216=884736 -1306368 +3S3 ⇒ 216= -421632 +3S3 ⇒ 3S3=216 +421632=421848 ⇒ S3=140616.

So, if n=3, we would have a cubic equation whose roots are a, b, c: x³ -S1x² + S2x -S3=0 ⇒ x³ -96x² +4536x -140616=0. Let's check if this cubic has positive real roots.

But solving a cubic is complicated. Alternatively, let's check if such numbers exist. Let's suppose two variables are equal. Let me assume a = b, then c=96 -2a.

Then, sum of squares: 2a² + (96 -2a)² =144. Let's compute that:

2a² + (96 -2a)² =2a² + 96² -4*96*a +4a²=6a² -384a +9216=144.

So, 6a² -384a +9216=144 ⇒6a² -384a +8972=0. Divide by 2:3a² -192a +4486=0.

Discriminant: 192² -4*3*4486=36864 -12*4486=36864 -53832= -16968. Negative discriminant, so no real solutions. Therefore, no real roots when two variables are equal. Hence, n=3 is impossible.

Similarly, trying n=4. Let's see. Let me check if n=64 is the only possible value.

Wait, but how?

Suppose that there exists another n≠64. Then, even if some a_i are different, the sums still have to satisfy the given conditions. But given that the sum of cubes is exactly 216, which is (96/64)^3 *64= (1.5)^3*64=3.375*64=216. So, if all a_i are 1.5, then the sum of cubes is 216. If we have different numbers, the sum of cubes would be different. For example, if one number is larger and another is smaller, how does the sum of cubes behave?

The function f(x)=x³ is convex, so by Jensen's inequality, if we have a deviation from the mean, the sum of cubes would increase. Wait, but the sum of cubes here is fixed at 216, which is exactly the sum if all a_i are equal. So, if we have some a_i larger and some smaller, the sum of cubes would be greater than 216 due to convexity. But in our problem, the sum of cubes is exactly 216, which is the minimal possible sum of cubes given the sum and sum of squares. Therefore, this implies that all a_i must be equal. Because if they are not all equal, the sum of cubes would be higher. Hence, the only possible n is 64.

Wait, this seems like a key insight. Let me verify.

</Execution_3>

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.2:
If all a_i are equal, then n=64. If they are not all equal, then the sum of cubes would be greater than 216. But in our case, the sum of cubes is exactly 216, so all a_i must be equal. Therefore, n must be 64.

But wait, let me confirm with another approach.

Suppose that we use the Cauchy-Schwarz and Hölder's inequalities.

<prompt_4.1> Use Hölder's inequality to confirm the sum of all possible values of n. </prompt_4.1>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
Hölder's inequality states that for positive real numbers, (∑a_i)^3 ≤ (∑a_i)(∑a_i²)(∑a_i^3). Wait, let me recall the exact form. Hölder's inequality for three sequences says that ∑|a_i b_i c_i| ≤ (∑|a_i|^p)^{1/p} (∑|b_i|^q)^{1/q} (∑|c_i|^r)^{1/r} } where 1/p +1/q +1/r =1. But maybe a different approach.

Alternatively, the inequality that relates the sums of powers. For positive real numbers, the relationship between the sums of different powers can be given by the Power Mean inequality. The Power Mean inequality states that for exponents r > s, (∑a_i^r /n)^{1/r} ≥ (∑a_i^s /n)^{1/s}. In our case, we have three sums: sum a_i =96, sum a_i²=144, sum a_i³=216. Let's compute the means:

For r=1: (96/n)

For r=2: (144/n)^{1/2}

For r=3: (216/n)^{1/3}

According to the Power Mean inequality, we should have:

(216/n)^{1/3} ≥ (144/n)^{1/2} ≥ (96/n)

Let me check if this holds.

First, (216/n)^{1/3} = (216)^{1/3} / n^{1/3} = 6/n^{1/3}.

Second, (144/n)^{1/2} = 12/n^{1/2}.

Third, 96/n.

So, according to Power Mean:

6/n^{1/3} ≥12/n^{1/2} ≥96/n.

Let's check the middle inequality: 12/n^{1/2} ≥96/n ⇒ Multiply both sides by n: 12n^{1/2} ≥96 ⇒n^{1/2} ≥8 ⇒n≥64.

Similarly, the first inequality: 6/n^{1/3} ≥12/n^{1/2} ⇒ Multiply both sides by n^{1/2}:6n^{1/6} ≥12 ⇒n^{1/6} ≥2 ⇒n≥64.

Therefore, both inequalities give n≥64. So, n must be at least 64. But in our problem, we have equality in all the Hölder/Power Mean inequalities. Equality holds in Power Mean if and only if all a_i are equal. Therefore, the only possible n is 64. Hence, the sum of all possible values of n is 64.

Therefore, the answer is \boxed{64}.
</execution_4.1>
</Execution_4>

<Plan_5>
Based on execution_4.1:
Wait, but the problem says "sum of all possible values of n". So, if n must be 64, then the sum is 64.
However, in the initial consideration, I thought maybe other n could exist, but with the Power Mean inequality, it seems that n must be 64.

But let me check again.

<prompt_5.1> Re-evaluate the possibility of other values of n using the Power Mean inequality. </prompt_5.1>
</Plan_5>

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
If n=64, then all the inequalities become equalities. For example, Cauchy-Schwarz becomes equality when all a_i are equal. Similarly, the Power Mean inequality becomes equality when all a_i are equal. Therefore, n must be 64.

But wait, if n>64, then according to the Power Mean inequality, the mean of the cubes should be greater than or equal to the mean of the squares, but in our case, the mean of the cubes is 216/n, and the mean of the squares is 144/n. So, 216/n ≥144/n ⇒216≥144, which is true. But the Power Mean inequality says that the higher mean should be greater than or equal. Since 216/n is the mean of cubes and 144/n is the mean of squares, and since 216/n ≥144/n, this holds. But equality holds only when all a_i are equal. So, if n>64, but we have the sum of cubes equal to 216, which is the same as when all a_i are equal. But if n>64, then 216/n <144/n, which contradicts the Power Mean inequality. Wait, 216/n must be greater than or equal to 144/n, which it is, but if n>64, then 216/n <144/n. Wait, no, 216/n and 144/n: 216 is greater than 144, so if n is the same, 216/n >144/n. But if n increases, both 216/n and 144/n decrease. But the Power Mean inequality says that the mean of the cubes is greater than or equal to the mean of the squares, which is true here because 216/n ≥144/n. So, even if n>64, as long as 216/n ≥144/n, which is equivalent to 216≥144, which is true, the inequality holds. Therefore, the Power Mean inequality does not impose a strict lower bound on n, except that n must be at least 1. But we already have n≥64 from Cauchy-Schwarz. Wait, this is getting confusing.

Wait, let's re-express the Power Mean inequality. The Power Mean inequality for r=3 and r=2 says that:

( (∑a_i³)/n )^{1/3} ≥ (∑a_i²/n )^{1/2} ≥ (∑a_i/n )

Which translates to:

(216/n)^{1/3} ≥ (144/n)^{1/2} ≥96/n.

Compute each term:

Left inequality: (216/n)^{1/3} = 6/n^{1/3} ≥12/n^{1/2} (since (144/n)^{1/2}=12/n^{1/2})

So, 6/n^{1/3} ≥12/n^{1/2} ⇒ Multiply both sides by n^{1/2}/6: n^{1/6} ≥2 ⇒n≥64.

Similarly, the right inequality: (144/n)^{1/2} ≥96/n ⇒12/n^{1/2} ≥96/n ⇒Multiply both sides by n:12n^{1/2} ≥96 ⇒n^{1/2} ≥8 ⇒n≥64.

Therefore, both inequalities give n≥64. Hence, equality holds when all a_i are equal. Therefore, the only possible n is 64. Therefore, the sum of all possible values of n is 64.

Based on execution_5.1:
But let me check if there's a case where even if the inequalities are strict, the sum of cubes remains 216. Suppose that two numbers are equal and the third is different. For example, n=3. Wait, we tried n=3 earlier and found no solution. Similarly, for n=4.

Let me test n=4. Let’s assume n=4. Then, sum a_i=96, sum a_i²=144, sum a_i³=216. Let's see if this is possible.

If all a_i=24, then sum a_i=96, sum a_i²=4*576=2304, which is way more than 144. So, not possible. If some are larger and some are smaller. Let's suppose two numbers are x and two are y. Then:

2x + 2y =96 ⇒x + y=48.

Sum of squares:2x² +2y²=144 ⇒x² + y²=72.

Sum of cubes:2x³ +2y³=216 ⇒x³ + y³=108.

From x + y=48 and x² + y²=72.

Compute (x + y)^2 =x² + 2xy + y²=48²=2304. But x² + y²=72, so 72 +2xy=2304 ⇒2xy=2304 -72=2232 ⇒xy=1116.

Then, x³ + y³=(x + y)(x² -xy + y²)=48*(72 -1116)=48*(-1044)= -50112≠108. So, impossible. Therefore, n=4 is impossible.

Hence, it seems that only n=64 works. Therefore, the sum of all possible values of n is 64.
