Okay, so I need to solve the equation x equals the square root of (11 minus 2x) plus 4. Let me write that down first to make sure I have it right: x = √(11 - 2x) + 4. Alright, the goal is to find all real values of x that satisfy this equation. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.

Since there's a square root involved, I remember that one common strategy is to isolate the square root term and then square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root. But before I can do that, maybe I should rearrange the equation to get the square root by itself. Let me try subtracting 4 from both sides. That would give me x - 4 = √(11 - 2x). Okay, now the square root is isolated. 

But wait, before squaring both sides, I should consider the domain of the original equation because the expression under the square root, which is 11 - 2x, must be non-negative. So 11 - 2x ≥ 0.

Alternatively, maybe I can try another approach to confirm. Let's suppose I let y = √(11 - 2x). Then the equation becomes x = y + 4. So x - 4 = y. Since y is the square root, y must be ≥ 0. So x - 4 ≥ 0, which implies x ≥ 4. But from the original equation, the domain was x ≤ 11/2, which is 5.5. So x must be between 4 and 5.5 inclusive.

<prompt_1.2> Explore an alternative method by substituting \( y = \sqrt{11 - 2x} \) and solve the resulting system of equations. </prompt_1.2>

Solving that, I get -2x ≥ -11, and dividing both sides by -2 (remembering to reverse the inequality sign when dividing by a negative) gives x ≤ 11/2. So x has to be less than or equal to 5.5. Got that. So whatever solutions we find, they have to satisfy x ≤ 5.5.

<execution_1.2>
So substituting y = x - 4 into the expression under the square root: 11 - 2x must be equal to y². So 11 - 2x = (x - 4)². Let's expand the right side: (x - 4)² = x² - 8x + 16. So 11 - 2x = x² - 8x + 16. Bringing all terms to one side: 0 = x² - 8x + 16 - 11 + 2x. Simplify: x² - 6x + 5 = 0. Which is the same quadratic as before. So factoring gives (x - 5)(x - 1) = 0, so x = 5 or x = 1. Then, checking in the original equation. For x =5: 5 = sqrt(11 -10) +4 → sqrt(1) +4 =1 +4=5, which works. For x=1: 1 = sqrt(11 -2) +4 → sqrt(9)+4=3+4=7≠1. So x=1 is invalid. So same result.

Based on execution_1.1:
Now, back to the equation: x - 4 = √(11 - 2x). To eliminate the square root, I'll square both sides. That gives (x - 4)² = (√(11 - 2x))². Simplifying both sides: left side becomes x² - 8x + 16, and the right side is just 11 - 2x. So now the equation is x² - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x.

<prompt_2.1> Square both sides of the equation \( x - 4 = \sqrt{11 - 2x} \) and simplify to form a quadratic equation. </prompt_2.1>

Based on execution_1.2:
Therefore, the solution is x=5.

But let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any mistakes. The original equation is x = sqrt(11 - 2x) + 4. We first determined the domain, which is x ≤ 5.5.
Then, by rearranging and squaring, we obtained a quadratic equation. Solving that gave two roots, but one was extraneous. So the only solution is 5. Also, checking in the domain: 5 is indeed less than 5.5, so that's okay.

Is there any other possible solution that we might have missed? Let's think.
Suppose there was another solution. Let's test x = 1. If x =1, then the right-hand side would be sqrt(11 - 2*1) +4 = sqrt(9) +4 = 3 +4 =7, which is not equal to 1. So that's not a solution. How about x=5.5?

<prompt_2.2> Test the boundary value \( x = 5.5 \) to see if it is a solution to the original equation. </prompt_2.2>

Another test: suppose x=3. Then RHS would be sqrt(11 -6) +4 = sqrt(5) +4 ≈2.236 +4≈6.236≠3. So nope.
So seems like only x=5 works.

Alternatively, maybe graph the functions y=x and y= sqrt(11 -2x)+4 and see where they intersect. The points of intersection would be the solutions. Since sqrt(11 -2x) is a decreasing function (as x increases, the value inside the sqrt decreases, so sqrt decreases), and y=x is a straight line. They might intersect at one or two points. But from our algebra, only one intersection point.

**Final Answer**
The solution is \boxed{5}.
