Okay, let's see. I need to solve this equation: 441 plus 2 times 21 times 19 plus 361 equals x. Hmm, so x is the sum of those three terms. Let me write it down step by step to make sure I don't make any mistakes.

First, let's break down the problem. The equation is 441 + 2*(21)*(19) + 361 = x. I need to compute each part separately and then add them up.

Starting with the first term, which is 441. That's straightforward. Then the second term is 2 multiplied by 21 multiplied by 19. Let me calculate that. So 2*21 is 42, right? Then 42*19. Hmm, 42 times 20 would be 840, but since it's 42 times 19, that's 840 minus 42, which is 798. So the second term is 798.
Then the third term is 361. So adding all three together: 441 + 798 + 361. Let me add 441 and 798 first. 441 + 700 is 1141, then plus 98 gives 1239. Then add 361 to that.

Wait, 1239 + 361. Let's see, 1239 + 300 is 1539, then plus 61 is 1600. So x equals 1600.

But let me check again to make sure I didn't miscalculate anywhere. Maybe there's a different way to approach this. Let me verify each step.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. The numbers 441 and 361 stand out. Let me check if they're perfect squares.

First term: 441. Correct. Second term: 2*21*19. 21*19. Let me calculate that another way. 21*20 is 420, minus 21 is 399. Then 399*2 is 798. Yep, that's the same as before. Third term: 361. That's 19 squared, right? 19*19 is 361. Interesting. So 21 squared is 441. Wait, 21*21 is 441, yes. So 21 squared plus 2*21*19 plus 19 squared. That's the expansion of (21 + 19)^2. Because (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2. So 21 + 19 is 40. 40 squared is 1600. So that's another way to see it. That's a quicker method. Instead of calculating each term separately, recognizing the formula for the square of a sum. So 21 squared plus 2*21*19 plus 19 squared equals (21 + 19)^2, which is 40 squared, which is 1600.

441 is 21 squared because 21*21 is 441. And 361 is 19 squared, since 19*19 is 361. Oh, interesting! So the equation can be rewritten as (21)^2 + 2*21*19 + (19)^2. Wait, that looks like the expansion of a square of a binomial. The formula is (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2. But here, we have a^2 + 2ab + b^2, which is exactly the expansion. So does that mean this expression is equal to (21 + 19)^2?

Based on execution_1.2:
Let me check: 21 + 19 is 40, and 40 squared is 1600, which matches the result I got earlier by direct calculation. So that's a smarter way, using algebraic identities to simplify the computation.

So both methods lead to x = 1600. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. But just to be thorough, let me go through the original calculation again without using the algebraic identity.

<execution_2.1>
441 plus 2*21*19 plus 361. Let's compute 2*21 first, which is 42. Then 42*19. Let me compute 42*20 again, which is 840, minus 42 gives 798. Then add 441 + 798. 441 + 700 is 1141, plus 98 is 1239. Then 1239 + 361. 1239 + 300 is 1539, plus 61 is 1600.

Based on execution_2.1, execution_1.2:
Either way, the answer is 1600. It's always good to check with different methods to ensure there's no mistake. Especially when dealing with exponents and multiplication, it's easy to mix up numbers, but in this case, both methods concur.
So I think that's solid. No mistakes detected in the process.

**Final Answer**
The value of \( x \) is \boxed{1600}.
