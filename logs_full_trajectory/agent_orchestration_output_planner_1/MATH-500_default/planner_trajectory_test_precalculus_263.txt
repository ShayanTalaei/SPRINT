Okay, so I need to find the matrix A such that when it acts on the vectors (3,1,0) and (-5,2,2), it produces (2,4,-3) and (0,-5,-5) respectively. Then, using that matrix A, I have to compute its action on the vector (-13,3,4). Hmm, let me think step by step.

First, I remember that if a matrix is multiplied by a vector, the result is a linear combination of the columns of the matrix. So, if I can express the given vectors as linear combinations of the standard basis vectors, then maybe I can figure out the columns of A. Wait, but the vectors given here are (3,1,0) and (-5,2,2). These are not the standard basis vectors. So, perhaps A is a 3x3 matrix because the outputs are in R^3. Let me confirm: the inputs are 3-dimensional vectors, and the outputs are also 3-dimensional. So A must be a 3x3 matrix.

But how do I find A? Since A acts on two different vectors and gives two results, maybe I can set up a system of equations. Let me denote A as a 3x3 matrix with columns a1, a2, a3.

<prompt_1.1> Set up a system of equations to represent the action of matrix A on the given vectors. </prompt_1.1>

Alternatively, perhaps there's another way to approach this problem. For example, if we consider that the vectors (3,1,0) and (-5,2,2) are in R^3, and we have their images under A. But since we only have two vectors, and A is a 3x3 matrix, we don't have enough information to uniquely determine A. Because in order to define a linear transformation (or matrix) in R^3, we need to know how it acts on a basis of R^3. Since two vectors might not form a basis, we might need more information.

Wait, no, actually, the columns of A are the images of the standard basis vectors. But here, we are given images of other vectors. So maybe I can express the given vectors in terms of the standard basis and then relate that to the columns of A.

Let me clarify. Let’s denote the standard basis vectors as e1 = (1,0,0), e2 = (0,1,0), e3 = (0,0,1). Then, any vector can be written as a linear combination of e1, e2, e3. The matrix A is defined by its action on these basis vectors: A*e1 = a1, A*e2 = a2, A*e3 = a3. So if I can express the given vectors (3,1,0) and (-5,2,2) in terms of e1, e2, e3, then their images under A would be linear combinations of a1, a2, a3.

For example, the first vector is (3,1,0) = 3e1 + 1e2 + 0e3. Therefore, A*(3e1 + e2) = 3Ae1 + Ae2 = 3a1 + a2. And this is equal to the vector (2,4,-3). Similarly, the second vector is (-5,2,2) = -5e1 + 2e2 + 2e3, so A*(-5e1 + 2e2 + 2e3) = -5Ae1 + 2Ae2 + 2Ae3 = -5a1 + 2a2 + 2a3, which equals (0,-5,-5).

So, putting this together, we have two equations:

1) 3a1 + a2 = (2,4,-3)

2) -5a1 + 2a2 + 2a3 = (0,-5,-5)

But we have three unknowns here: a1, a2, a3. Each of these is a 3-dimensional vector. So, we have a system of linear equations where the variables are the columns of A.

Hmm, so how do we solve this? Since we have two equations but three unknowns, it seems underdetermined. But maybe there's a third equation we can get? Wait, no. The problem only gives us two vectors and their images. So unless there's some assumption we can make, like A is a specific type of matrix (e.g., symmetric, etc. ), we might not be able to determine A uniquely. But the problem is asking us to compute A times another vector, so perhaps even with two equations, we can express the result in terms of the given information?

<execution_1.2>
Wait, but in this problem, they are giving two vectors and their images, and then asking for the image of another vector. Maybe there's a way to express the third vector needed to complete the basis? Wait, but maybe the third vector is redundant? Let me check if the given vectors (3,1,0) and (-5,2,2) are linearly independent.

Calculating the determinant of the matrix formed by these vectors as columns. Wait, but since they are in R^3, to check linear independence, we can form a matrix with these vectors and see if they are linearly independent. Let's see:

Let me form a matrix with columns (3,1,0) and (-5,2,2). To check if they are linearly independent, we can see if one is a scalar multiple of the other. Let's check:

Is there a scalar k such that (-5,2,2) = k*(3,1,0)?

Looking at the first component: -5 = 3k ⇒ k = -5/3.

Then check the second component: 2 = 1*k ⇒ k = 2. But -5/3 ≠ 2. So they are linearly independent. Therefore, these two vectors form a linearly independent set in R^3. However, since R^3 requires three linearly independent vectors to form a basis, we don't have a full basis here. Therefore, the matrix A is not uniquely determined by just these two vectors. Wait, but in the problem statement, they are giving two equations and asking for one output. So maybe even without knowing the entire matrix A, we can compute the desired output by expressing the vector (-13,3,4) as a linear combination of the given input vectors and then applying A?

Based on execution_1.1:
Wait, but how?

Let me think. Let’s denote the two given vectors as v1 = (3,1,0) and v2 = (-5,2,2). Their images under A are Av1 = (2,4,-3) and Av2 = (0,-5,-5). We need to compute A*v3 where v3 = (-13,3,4).

If we can express v3 as a linear combination of v1 and v2, then A*v3 would be the same linear combination of Av1 and Av2. However, since v1 and v2 are in R^3, and we are trying to express v3 as a combination of v1 and v2, we need to solve the equation:

<prompt_2.1> Determine if the vector (-13,3,4) can be expressed as a linear combination of the vectors (3,1,0) and (-5,2,2). </prompt_2.1>

Based on execution_1.2:
But how to do that? Let me try.

Suppose we want to express (-13,3,4) as a linear combination of (3,1,0) and (-5,2,2). Let’s set up the equation:

<prompt_2.2> Express the vector (-13,3,4) as a linear combination of the vectors (3,1,0) and (-5,2,2) and verify the result. </prompt_2.2>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
c1*v1 + c2*v2 = v3

Which is:

c1*(3,1,0) + c2*(-5,2,2) = (-13,3,4)

This gives a system of equations:

3c1 -5c2 = -13

1c1 + 2c2 = 3

0c1 + 2c2 = 4

So, let's solve this system. The third equation is 2c2 = 4 ⇒ c2 = 2. Then substitute c2 = 2 into the second equation: c1 + 4 = 3 ⇒ c1 = -1. Then check the first equation: 3*(-1) -5*(2) = -3 -10 = -13, which matches.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
a*(3,1,0) + b*(-5,2,2) = (-13,3,4)

This gives us a system of equations:

3a -5b = -13

a*1 + b*2 = 3

0*a + b*2 = 4

Wait, the third component: 0*a + 2b = 4. So from the third equation: 2b = 4 ⇒ b = 2.

Then substitute b = 2 into the second equation: a + 2*2 = 3 ⇒ a + 4 = 3 ⇒ a = -1.

Now check the first equation: 3*(-1) -5*(2) = -3 -10 = -13. Which matches. So yes, (-13,3,4) = -1*(3,1,0) + 2*(-5,2,2).
</execution_2.2>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Therefore, since A is a linear transformation (because matrix multiplication is linear), we can apply A to both sides:

A*(-1*v1 + 2*v2) = -1*A*v1 + 2*A*v2

Which is:

-1*(2,4,-3) + 2*(0,-5,-5) = (-2, -4, 3) + (0, -10, -10) = (-2 + 0, -4 -10, 3 -10) = (-2, -14, -7)

Therefore, A*(-13,3,4) = (-2, -14, -7).

Wait, but hold on. Is this correct?

<prompt_3.1> Verify the approach and calculation to ensure the solution is correct. </prompt_3.1>
-----

Based on execution_2.2:
Therefore, using the linearity of A, we can compute A*(-13,3,4) as:

A*(-13,3,4) = -1*A*(3,1,0) + 2*A*(-5,2,2) = -1*(2,4,-3) + 2*(0,-5,-5) = (-2, -4, 3) + (0, -10, -10) = (-2, -14, -7).
So the answer is (-2, -14, -7).

But wait, in the previous approach, I tried to express (-13,3,4) as a combination of v1 and v2, but in reality, in R^3, any vector can be expressed as a linear combination of any two linearly independent vectors plus a third vector orthogonal to them. Wait, but since we only have two vectors, maybe the third component is not expressible? Wait, but in this case, we were able to express (-13,3,4) as a combination of v1 and v2. So that's why it worked.

But the key here is that the original vectors (3,1,0) and (-5,2,2) are in R^3, and the vector we need to apply A to is also in R^3. So if that vector can be expressed as a linear combination of the given vectors, then we can apply A and get the result as the same combination of the images. But if it cannot be expressed as such (i.e., if it's not in the span of the given vectors), then we can't determine A's action on it without more information.

<prompt_3.2> Recap the solution and confirm the final answer. </prompt_3.2>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
The key assumption here is that (-13,3,4) can be expressed as a linear combination of v1 and v2. But since we were able to find such coefficients (c1 = -1 and c2 = 2), that means (-13,3,4) is indeed in the span of v1 and v2. Therefore, since A is a linear transformation, we can apply it to the linear combination. So the answer should be (-2, -14, -7).
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
But in this case, since we could express (-13,3,4) as a combination of (3,1,0) and (-5,2,2), we were able to compute A*(-13,3,4) using the linearity. Therefore, the answer is (-2, -14, -7). 

But let me check if there's another way this could be approached, just to confirm. For example, constructing the matrix A explicitly. Let's try that.

Earlier, we tried to set up equations for the columns of A, but we only have two equations. Let me see if we can proceed further. Let's denote A as:

A = [a1 | a2 | a3]

Given that:

1) 3a1 + a2 = (2,4,-3)

2) -5a1 + 2a2 + 2a3 = (0,-5,-5)

We need a third equation to solve for a1, a2, a3. But since we don't have another vector's image, we might not be able to get another equation. However, perhaps if we assume that the third column a3 can be expressed in terms of a1 and a2? Wait, but how?

Alternatively, maybe we can express a3 in terms of a1 and a2 from the second equation. Let's rearrange equation 2:

-5a1 + 2a2 + 2a3 = (0,-5,-5)

So, 2a3 = 5a1 - 2a2 + (0,-5,-5)

Therefore, a3 = (5a1 - 2a2)/2 + (0,-5,-5)/2

But this introduces a3 in terms of a1 and a2. However, without knowing a3, how can we proceed? Wait, but maybe when we apply A to the vector (-13,3,4), which is expressed as -1*(3,1,0) + 2*(-5,2,2), we don't need a3 at all. Because the vector is in the span of the first two vectors, so the third column of A doesn't affect the result. Therefore, even if we don't know a3, we can compute the required A*v3 using only the first two columns.
</execution_3.2>
</Execution_3>

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.2:
Therefore, regardless of what a3 is, since the vector (-13,3,4) is in the span of the first two vectors, the coefficients for a1 and a2 are sufficient, and a3 doesn't come into play. Therefore, the previous calculation is valid.

So, after considering both approaches and verifying, the answer is indeed (-2, -14, -7).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ -14 \\ -7 \end{pmatrix}}
