Okay, let's see. The problem says that the arithmetic mean of the numbers 7, 2, x, and 10 is 9. I need to find the value of x. Hmm, arithmetic mean, right? So that's just the average of the numbers. To find the average, you add up all the numbers and then divide by how many numbers there are. In this case, there are four numbers: 7, 2, x, and 10. The mean is given as 9.
So, if I remember the formula for the mean, it's (sum of all numbers) divided by (number of numbers). So, translating that into an equation, it would be (7 + 2 + x + 10) divided by 4 equals 9. Let me write that down to make it clearer.

So, (7 + 2 + x + 10)/4 = 9.

Based on execution_1.1:
First, maybe I should simplify the numerator. Let's add the numbers that are given. 7 plus 2 is 9, and then 9 plus 10 is 19. So, the equation becomes (19 + x)/4 = 9. Now, to solve for x, I can multiply both sides of the equation by 4.
That should get rid of the denominator. So, 19 + x = 9 * 4. Calculating 9 times 4, that's 36. So now the equation is 19 + x = 36. 

To isolate x, I need to subtract 19 from both sides.

<prompt_2.1> Solve the equation 19 + x = 36 for x by isolating x. </prompt_2.1>

<execution_2.1>
Let me do that. So, x = 36 - 19. Hmm, 36 minus 19. Let me calculate that. 36 minus 10 is 26, then minus 9 more is 17. So, x should be 17.

Based on execution_2.1:
Wait, let me check if that makes sense.
If I substitute x = 17 back into the original numbers, the set becomes 7, 2, 17, 10. Let's add those up: 7 + 2 is 9, 9 + 17 is 26, 26 + 10 is 36. Then, the mean is 36 divided by 4, which is 9. That matches the given mean, so it must be correct.

But just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my steps. Let's go through the solution again.

<execution_3.1>
The mean is (7 + 2 + x + 10)/4 = 9. Combine the constants: 7 + 2 + 10 is indeed 19. So, (19 + x)/4 = 9. Multiply both sides by 4: 19 + x = 36. Subtract 19: x = 17.

<Final_answer>
Therefore, the value of $x$ is $\boxed{17}$.
