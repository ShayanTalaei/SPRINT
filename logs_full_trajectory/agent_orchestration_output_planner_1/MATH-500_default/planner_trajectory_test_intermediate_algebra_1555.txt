Okay, so I need to find the remainder when the polynomial (5x + 9)^611 + (x + 5)^11 + (x - 1)^11 + 3x^2 + 1 is divided by x + 2. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

<execution_1.1>
I remember that when dividing a polynomial by a linear divisor like x + 2, the Remainder Theorem is useful. The theorem states that the remainder of a polynomial f(x) divided by (x - a) is f(a). But here, the divisor is x + 2, which is the same as (x - (-2)). So, according to the theorem, the remainder should be f(-2), where f(x) is the given polynomial.

Based on execution_1.1:
That means I need to evaluate the polynomial at x = -2.
Let me write that out step by step.

First, let's denote the polynomial as:
f(x) = (5x + 9)^611 + (x + 5)^11 + (x - 1)^11 + 3x^2 + 1

So, the remainder when f(x) is divided by x + 2 is f(-2).

Now, let's compute each term of f(-2) separately.

Starting with the first term: (5x + 9)^611 evaluated at x = -2.

<prompt_2.1> Calculate the first term of the polynomial evaluated at x = -2. </prompt_2.1>

Next term: (x + 5)^11 evaluated at x = -2.

<prompt_2.2> Calculate the second term of the polynomial evaluated at x = -2. </prompt_2.2>

Third term: (x - 1)^11 evaluated at x = -2.

<prompt_2.3> Calculate the third term of the polynomial evaluated at x = -2. </prompt_2.3>

Fourth term: 3x^2 evaluated at x = -2.

<prompt_2.4> Calculate the fourth term of the polynomial evaluated at x = -2. </prompt_2.4>

Last term: 1, which is just 1.
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Plugging in x = -2: 5*(-2) + 9 = -10 + 9 = -1. So, this term becomes (-1)^611. Since 611 is an odd number, this is -1.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Then, the next term: (x - 1)^11 at x = -2. Let me compute each part step by step.

Let's handle the first term: (5x + 9) when x = -2.

5*(-2) + 9 = -10 + 9 = -1. So, the first term becomes (-1)^611.
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
Fourth term: 3x^2 evaluated at x = -2.

Fifth term: 1, which is just 1.
</execution_2.3>

<execution_2.4>
Fifth term: 1.

Let me compute each of these step by step.
</execution_2.4>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1, execution_2.2, execution_2.3, execution_2.4:
First term: (5x + 9)^611 at x = -2.

<prompt_3.1> Calculate each term of the polynomial at x = -2 and sum them up to find the remainder. </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
5*(-2) = -10. -10 + 9 = -1. So, (-1)^611. 611 divided by 2 gives a remainder of 1, so this is -1.

Second term: (x + 5)^11 at x = -2. (-2) + 5 = 3. So, 3^11. Let me calculate that. 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^10 = 59049, 3^11 = 177147.

Third term: (x - 1)^11 at x = -2. (-2) - 1 = -3. So, (-3)^11. Since the exponent is odd, this is -3^11. Let me compute 3^11 first, which we already did as 177147, so -177147.

Fourth term: 3x^2 at x = -2. x^2 is (-2)^2 = 4. So, 3*4 = 12.

Fifth term is 1.

Now, summing all these up:

First term: -1

Second term: +177147

Third term: -177147

Fourth term: +12

Fifth term: +1

So, adding them step by step:

Start with -1 + 177147 = 177146

Then, 177146 - 177147 = -1

Then, -1 + 12 = 11

Then, 11 + 1 = 12.

Based on execution_3.1:
Wait, that seems too straightforward.

Let me check again.

First term: (5x +9)^611 at x = -2: 5*(-2) +9 = -10 +9 = -1. (-1)^611 = -1.

<prompt_4.1> Verify the calculations of each term and the final result. </prompt_4.1>

Wait, but let me double-check each term to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic mistake.

First term: (5*(-2)+9) = (-10+9)=-1. (-1)^611=-1.

<prompt_4.2> Re-evaluate each term to verify the calculations. </prompt_4.2>

Hmm. That seems correct.

Wait, but let me consider if there's any other approach to verify this result.

Alternatively, maybe using modular arithmetic for polynomials?

<execution_4.1>
Second term: (x +5)^11 at x = -2: (-2 +5)=3. 3^11=177147.

Third term: (x -1)^11 at x = -2: (-2 -1)=-3. (-3)^11=-177147.

Fourth term: 3*(-2)^2=3*4=12.

Fifth term:1.

Adding up: -1 +177147 -177147 +12 +1.

Indeed, the 177147 and -177147 cancel each other, leaving -1 +12 +1 =12.
</execution_4.1>

<execution_4.2>
Correct.

Second term: (-2 +5)=3. 3^11=177147. Correct.

Third term: (-2 -1)=-3. (-3)^11=-177147. Correct.

Fourth term: 3*(-2)^2=3*4=12. Correct.

Fifth term: 1.

Sum: -1 +177147 -177147 +12 +1.

So, the 177147 and -177147 cancel each other out. Then, -1 +12 +1 =12.
</execution_4.2>

<execution_4.3>
But in this case, since we are evaluating at x = -2, the Remainder Theorem directly gives the answer as f(-2). So, unless there's a miscalculation here, the remainder should be 12.

But let me check once more each term:

First term: (5x +9)^611 at x=-2: 5*(-2)= -10 +9= -1. (-1)^611= -1.

Second term: (x +5)^11 at x=-2: (-2 +5)=3. 3^11=177147.

Third term: (x -1)^11 at x=-2: (-2 -1)= -3. (-3)^11= -177147.

Fourth term: 3xÂ² at x=-2: 3*(-2)^2=3*4=12.

Fifth term: 1.

Adding them: -1 +177147 -177147 +12 +1.

So, the 177147 and -177147 cancel each other out. Then, -1 +12 +1 =12.

Yes, that's correct. So, the remainder is 12.

But wait, let me make sure that there's no mistake in the exponents. For example, (x +5)^11 at x=-2 is 3^11. Let me confirm 3^11 again.

Calculating 3^11 step by step:

3^1 =3

3^2=9

3^3=27

3^4=81

3^5=243

3^6=729

3^7=2187

3^8=6561

3^9=19683

3^10=59049

3^11=177147. Correct.

Similarly, (-3)^11 is -177147. Correct.

So, the terms do cancel out as I thought.

Therefore, the remainder is 12.
