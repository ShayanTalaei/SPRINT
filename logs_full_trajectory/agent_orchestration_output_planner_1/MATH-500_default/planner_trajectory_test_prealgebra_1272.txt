Okay, so Louis and Jack are sharing a pie, and I need to figure out how much of the pie they eat altogether. Let me start by understanding the problem. Louis eats 1/5 of the pie, and Jack eats 2/3. I need to add those two fractions together to find the total amount they ate. Hmm, adding fractions. Let me recall how to add fractions with different denominators.

First, I remember that to add fractions, they need to have the same denominator. The denominators here are 5 and 3. So I need to find a common denominator for these two fractions. The least common denominator (LCD) of 5 and 3 would be their least common multiple (LCM). The multiples of 5 are 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, etc. , and the multiples of 3 are 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, etc. The smallest common multiple is 15. So, the LCD is 15.

Next, I need to convert both fractions to have this common denominator. Let's start with Louis's portion: 1/5.

<prompt_1.1> Convert the fractions 1/5 and 2/3 to have the common denominator 15. </prompt_1.1>

<execution_1.1>
To convert 1/5 to a fraction with denominator 15, I multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 3 (since 5 * 3 = 15). That gives me (1 * 3)/(5 * 3) = 3/15.

Now, Jack's portion is 2/3. To convert this to a denominator of 15, I multiply numerator and denominator by 5 (since 3 * 5 = 15). That gives (2 * 5)/(3 * 5) = 10/15.

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Now, I can add the two fractions: 3/15 + 10/15. Since the denominators are the same, I just add the numerators.
3 + 10 = 13. So, the sum is 13/15.

Wait a second, let me check if this fraction can be simplified. The numerator is 13, which is a prime number. The denominator is 15, whose factors are 3 and 5.
13 doesn't share any common factors with 15 except 1, so 13/15 is already in its simplest form.

Therefore, altogether, Louis and Jack eat 13/15 of the pie.

Let me verify this another way to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's convert both fractions to decimals and add them, then convert back to a fraction.

<prompt_2.1> Verify the result by converting the fractions to decimals, adding them, and converting back to a fraction. </prompt_2.1>

Alternatively, I can use another common denominator, but 15 is the smallest, so using that is efficient. Let me try using 30 just to confirm.

<prompt_2.2> Use 30 as a common denominator to verify the result and compare it with the previous method. </prompt_2.2>

<execution_2.1>
Louis eats 1/5, which is 0.2. Jack eats 2/3, which is approximately 0.666.... Adding 0.2 and 0.666 gives 0.866.... Now, converting 13/15 to a decimal: 13 divided by 15. Let's see, 15 goes into 13 zero times. Add a decimal point, 15 into 130. 15*8=120, so 8*15 is 120. Subtract 120 from 130, remainder 10. Bring down a zero: 100. 15*6=90. So 6*15 is 90. Subtract 90 from 100, remainder 10. Bring down a zero: 100 again. This will repeat, so 13/15 is approximately 0.8666...., which matches the sum of 0.2 + 0.666... So that checks out.

<execution_2.2>
For Louis's 1/5, converting to 30 as denominator: 1/5 = 6/30 (since 5*6=30, so multiply numerator and denominator by 6). Jack's 2/3: 2/3 = 20/30 (since 3*10=30, multiply numerator and denominator by 10). Adding 6/30 + 20/30 = 26/30. Simplifying 26/30 by dividing numerator and denominator by 2 gives 13/15.

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1, execution_2.2:
So all methods lead to 13/15.
Therefore, I can be confident that the total amount of pie eaten by Louis and Jack is 13/15.

No prompt to execute.

<Final_answer>
Therefore, the total amount of the pie that Louis and Jack eat altogether is $\boxed{\frac{13}{15}}$.
