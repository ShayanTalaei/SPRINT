If we write $\sqrt{2}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \sqrt{3} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$ in the form $\dfrac{a\sqrt{2} + b\sqrt{3}}{c}$ such that $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive integers and $c$ is as small as possible, then what is $a+b+c$?

Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. The question is asking to rewrite the expression √2 + 1/√2 + √3 + 1/√3 in the form (a√2 + b√3)/c, where a, b, and c are positive integers, and c is as small as possible. Then we need to find the sum a + b + c. Hmm, alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to simplify each term in the original expression. Let's look at each pair: √2 and 1/√2, then √3 and 1/√3. Maybe if I combine each pair first, it will make it easier to combine them into the desired form.

Starting with the first pair: √2 + 1/√2. To add these two terms, they need a common denominator. The denominators here are 1 and √2. So, if I rationalize 1/√2, that becomes √2/2. So, √2 is the same as 2√2/2. Therefore, adding them together: 2√2/2 + √2/2 = (2√2 + √2)/2.
Combining like terms, that's 3√2/2.

Let me check that again.
√2 is equal to √2/1, and 1/√2 is √2/2. So, converting √2 to have a denominator of 2: multiply numerator and denominator by 2.

<prompt_1.1> Verify the simplification of √2 + 1/√2 as done in the above plan. </prompt_1.1>

Now, moving on to the second pair: √3 + 1/√3. Similarly, let's rationalize 1/√3 to get √3/3. Then, √3 can be written as 3√3/3. Adding them together: 3√3/3 + √3/3 = (3√3 + √3)/3 = 4√3/3.

Let me verify that.
√3 is √3/1, and 1/√3 is √3/3. Converting √3 to have denominator 3: multiply numerator and denominator by 3. That gives 3√3/3. Then adding √3/3 gives 4√3/3.

So now, the original expression simplifies to 3√2/2 + 4√3/3. The next step is to combine these two terms into a single fraction. To do that, we need a common denominator for the two fractions. The denominators are 2 and 3. The least common denominator (LCD) of 2 and 3 is 6. So, we'll convert each fraction to have denominator 6.

<prompt_1.2> Combine 3√2/2 and 4√3/3 into a single fraction using the least common denominator. </prompt_1.2>

So, √2 becomes (2√2)/2. Then adding √2/2 gives (2√2 + √2)/2 = 3√2/2. Yeah, that seems right.
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
Starting with 3√2/2: multiply numerator and denominator by 3 to get (3√2 * 3)/(2 * 3) = 9√2/6.

Then, 4√3/3: multiply numerator and denominator by 2 to get (4√3 * 2)/(3 * 2) = 8√3/6.

Now, adding these two fractions: 9√2/6 + 8√3/6 = (9√2 + 8√3)/6.
</execution_1.2>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.2:
So, according to this, a is 9, b is 8, and c is 6. Then, a + b + c would be 9 + 8 + 6 = 23.

But wait, the problem says "c is as small as possible". Is 6 the smallest possible denominator here? Let me check if there's a way to simplify this fraction further or if there's another way to combine the terms that might result in a smaller denominator.

Looking back at the steps:

<prompt_2.1> Verify if the denominator can be smaller by considering the simplification of the expression. </prompt_2.1>

But just to make sure, let me think if there's another approach. Maybe instead of combining each pair first, combine all terms together. Let's see:

<prompt_2.2> Explore an alternative approach to combine all terms together and verify the result. </prompt_2.2>

Let me check once more if 9, 8, and 6 have any common factors.

<prompt_2.3> Verify the greatest common divisor of 9, 8, and 6 to confirm the smallest possible denominator. </prompt_2.3>

Wait, but let me confirm once again if combining the terms is the only way. Suppose someone tried to write each term with different denominators but maybe a different common multiple.
But since the original expression after simplifying each pair gives denominators 2 and 3, the LCD is 6, so that's the smallest possible. If we tried a higher common multiple, like 12, then c would be 12, which is larger, so we don't want that. So 6 is indeed the smallest possible c.

Therefore, the answer is 23.

**Final Answer**
The value of \(a + b + c\) is \boxed{23}\).
