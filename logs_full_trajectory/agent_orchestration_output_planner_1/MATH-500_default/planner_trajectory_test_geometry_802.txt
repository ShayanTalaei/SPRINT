Okay, so I need to find the area of a triangle that has sides measuring 5, 5, and 6 units. Let me think about how to approach this.

<prompt_1.1> Identify the type of triangle with sides 5, 5, and 6, and determine the most appropriate method to find its area. </prompt_1.1>

<execution_1.1>
First, I remember that when all three sides of a triangle are known, Heron's formula is a good method to calculate the area. Heron's formula states that the area of a triangle with sides a, b, and c is the square root of [s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)], where s is the semi-perimeter of the triangle. The semi-perimeter is half the sum of all the sides. Let me check if that applies here. Since the sides are 5, 5, and 6, this is an isosceles triangle because two sides are equal. That might also mean that maybe there's another way to calculate the area, like using the base and height, but Heron's formula might be straightforward here.

Based on execution_1.1:
Let me try both methods to see if I get the same answer. First, using Heron's formula.

Calculating the semi-perimeter (s):

s = (a + b + c) / 2 = (5 + 5 + 6) / 2 = (16) / 2 = 8.

Wait, 5 + 5 is 10, plus 6 is 16? Wait, no, 5 + 5 is 10, and 10 + 6 is 16.

<prompt_2.1> Verify the calculation of the semi-perimeter using the sides 5, 5, and 6. </prompt_2.1>

Now, using the base and height approach. Since it's an isosceles triangle with sides 5, 5, and 6, the base is 6 units, and the two equal sides are 5 units each. If I split the triangle into two right-angled triangles by drawing the height, each right triangle will have a base of 3 units (half of 6), a hypotenuse of 5 units (the equal side of the original triangle), and the height as the other side. Then, using the Pythagorean theorem, the height (h) can be calculated as:

h² + 3² = 5²

h² + 9 = 25

Subtracting 9 from both sides:

h² = 16

Taking the square root:

h = 4

Then, the area is (base * height) / 2 = (6 * 4)/2 = 24/2 = 12.

Wait, but let me make sure that splitting the triangle into two right triangles is valid here.

Yes, in an isosceles triangle, the height from the apex (the vertex opposite the base) bisects the base, so that's exactly how it works.

Alternatively, if I didn't split the triangle but tried to use another base, say one of the sides of length 5, then the base would be 5, but I would need to find the corresponding height, which might be more complicated.

So 16 divided by 2 is 8. That seems right.

Now, applying Heron's formula:

Area = √[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)] = √[8(8 - 5)(8 - 5)(8 - 6)].

Calculating each term inside the square root:

8 - 5 = 3, so two of those terms are 3. Then 8 - 6 = 2. So plugging those in:

Area = √[8 * 3 * 3 * 2].

Multiplying those together: 8 * 3 is 24, 24 * 3 is 72, 72 * 2 is 144. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, actually, let me do the multiplication step by step.

First, 8 * 3 = 24. Then, 24 * 3 = 72. Then, 72 * 2 = 144. So inside the square root, it's 144. Therefore, the area is √144 = 12.

Based on execution_2.1:
Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me verify this with another method to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Alternatively, since it's an isosceles triangle, maybe I can use the formula for area as (base * height)/2. Let's try that.

<prompt_3.1> Verify the area calculation using the base and height method for the triangle with sides 5, 5, and 6. </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<execution_3.1>
First, identify the base. Let's take the base as the side that's 6 units. Then, the two equal sides are 5 units each. If I draw the height from the apex to the base, it splits the base into two equal parts of 3 units each. Then, the height can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in one of the right-angled triangles formed. Each right triangle has a hypotenuse of 5 units (the equal side), one leg is 3 units (half the base), and the other leg is the height (h). So:

h² + 3² = 5²

h² + 9 = 25

Subtract 9 from both sides:

h² = 16

So h = 4. Then, the area is (base * height)/2 = (6 * 4)/2 = 24/2 = 12.

Based on execution_3.1:
So both Heron's formula and the base-height method give the same answer, which is reassuring. Let me just check if there's any other way to approach this, maybe using trigonometry?

For example, if I can find one of the angles and then use the formula (1/2)*ab*sinθ. But since we don't have any angles given, that might require more steps. Let's see.

<prompt_4.1> Consider and evaluate the feasibility of using trigonometry or the Law of Cosines to find the area of the triangle. </prompt_4.1>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
Alternatively, using the Law of Cosines to find one of the angles. Let's try that.

Let me label the triangle. Let's say the two sides of 5 units are sides AB and AC, and the base BC is 6 units. Then angle A is the vertex angle, and angles B and C are the base angles. Let's try to find angle A using the Law of Cosines.

Law of Cosines states that c² = a² + b² - 2ab*cosθ, where θ is the angle opposite side c. In this case, to find angle A, which is opposite side BC (which is 6 units), the sides adjacent to angle A are both 5 units. So:

6² = 5² + 5² - 2*5*5*cosθ

Calculating:

36 = 25 + 25 - 50*cosθ

36 = 50 - 50*cosθ

Subtract 50 from both sides:

36 - 50 = -50*cosθ

-14 = -50*cosθ

Divide both sides by -50:

cosθ = 14/50 = 7/25

Therefore, θ = arccos(7/25). Then, sinθ would be sqrt(1 - (7/25)²).

Calculating sinθ:

sinθ = sqrt(1 - 49/625) = sqrt(576/625) = 24/25.

Then, using the formula (1/2)*ab*sinθ, where a and b are the sides enclosing angle θ. Here, a and b are both 5 units. So:

Area = (1/2)*5*5*(24/25) = (1/2)*25*(24/25) = (1/2)*24 = 12.

Based on execution_4.1:
So that's the third method giving the same answer.
All three methods—Heron's formula, base-height, and using the sine of an angle—result in an area of 12 square units.

Just to recap:

1. **Heron's Formula**:

<prompt_5.1> Recap and compare the results from Heron's formula, the base-height method, and the Law of Cosines with the sine of an angle. </prompt_5.1>
</Plan_5>

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
- Semi-perimeter (s) = 8
- Area = √[8*(8-5)*(8-5)*(8-6)] = √[8*3*3*2] = √144 = 12

2. **Base-Height**:
- Base = 6, Height = 4 (found using Pythagoras)
- Area = (6*4)/2 = 12

3. **Law of Cosines + Sine**:
- Found angle A using Law of Cosines: cosθ = 7/25
- sinθ = 24/25
- Area = (1/2)*5*5*(24/25) = 12

All methods converge to the same answer.
