<Question>
A strictly increasing sequence of positive integers $a_1$, $a_2$, $a_3$, $\dots$ has the property that for every positive integer $k$, the subsequence $a_{2k-1}$, $a_{2k}$, $a_{2k+1}$ is geometric and the subsequence $a_{2k}$, $a_{2k+1}$, $a_{2k+2}$ is arithmetic. Suppose that $a_{13} = 2016$. Find $a_1$.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. It seems a bit involved, but if I break it down, maybe I can figure it out. So, we have a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers, and there are some conditions about geometric and arithmetic subsequences. The goal is to find a₁ given that a₁₃ = 2016.

First, let me parse the problem again to make sure I understand all the conditions.

<prompt_1.1> Parse the problem to understand the conditions and what needs to be found. </prompt_1.1>

Given that the sequence is strictly increasing, all terms are positive integers, and each of these conditions must hold for every positive integer k. Let's start by writing down the conditions more formally.

For every k ≥ 1:
1. The subsequence a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} is geometric.
2. The subsequence a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} is arithmetic.

So, for each k, these three terms form a geometric sequence, and the next three terms form an arithmetic sequence. Let's recall that in a geometric sequence, each term is a multiple of the previous one by a common ratio r. Since we're dealing with positive integers, r must be a rational number, right? Because if the terms are integers, the ratio can't be irrational (otherwise, multiplying by an irrational number would result in a non-integer). Similarly, for the arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms must be an integer.

Let's start with the first condition: a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} is geometric. Therefore, the ratio between consecutive terms is constant. So:

<prompt_1.2> Derive the relationship between terms of the sequence using the geometric and arithmetic conditions. </prompt_1.2>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
1. The sequence is strictly increasing: a₁ < a₂ < a₃ < ...
2. For every positive integer k:
   - The subsequence a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} is geometric.
   - The subsequence a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} is arithmetic.
3. a₁₃ = 2016.
4. Find a₁.

First, let's recall what geometric and arithmetic sequences mean. A geometric sequence has the property that each term is a multiple of the previous term by a common ratio. So, for the geometric part, a_{2k} / a_{2k-1} = a_{2k+1} / a_{2k}. Let's denote this common ratio by r_k. Similarly, an arithmetic sequence has a common difference, so a_{2k+1} - a_{2k} = a_{2k+2} - a_{2k+1}. Let's denote this common difference by d_k.

But here's the thing: the ratio r_k and difference d_k might vary with k. The problem doesn't state that the sequence is geometric or arithmetic overall, just that every other pair of consecutive terms forms a geometric sequence and the next three form an arithmetic sequence. So, the ratios and differences can change as k changes. That complicates things a bit, but maybe there's a pattern or a recurrence relation we can find.
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
a_{2k} / a_{2k-1} = a_{2k+1} / a_{2k}

Which implies that:

a_{2k+1} = (a_{2k}^2) / a_{2k-1}

Similarly, for the arithmetic sequence a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2}, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. So:

a_{2k+1} - a_{2k} = a_{2k+2} - a_{2k+1}

Which implies:

a_{2k+2} = 2a_{2k+1} - a_{2k}

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.2:
So, starting from a₁, we can try to express subsequent terms in terms of a₁ and possibly some ratios/ratios. But since the ratios can vary with k, we might need to find a recursive relationship or perhaps express terms in terms of previous ones.

Let me try to write out the first few terms to see if a pattern emerges.

Let's start with k = 1:

<prompt_2.1> Calculate the first few terms of the sequence using the derived relationships. </prompt_2.1>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
For k = 1:
- The subsequence a₁, a₂, a₃ is geometric. So, a₂ / a₁ = a₃ / a₂ ⇒ a₃ = (a₂²)/a₁.
- The subsequence a₂, a₃, a₄ is arithmetic. So, a₃ - a₂ = a₄ - a₃ ⇒ a₄ = 2a₃ - a₂.

For k = 2:
- The subsequence a₃, a₄, a₅ is geometric. So, a₄ / a₃ = a₅ / a₄ ⇒ a₅ = (a₄²)/a₃.
- The subsequence a₄, a₅, a₆ is arithmetic. So, a₅ - a₄ = a₆ - a₅ ⇒ a₆ = 2a₅ - a₄.

For k = 3:
- The subsequence a₅, a₆, a₇ is geometric. So, a₆ / a₅ = a₇ / a₆ ⇒ a₇ = (a₆²)/a₅.
- The subsequence a₆, a₇, a₈ is arithmetic. So, a₇ - a₆ = a₈ - a₇ ⇒ a₈ = 2a₇ - a₆.

And so on. Each odd index term (a₁, a₃, a₅, etc. ) is part of a geometric sequence with the next two terms, which then form the start of an arithmetic sequence leading into the next geometric term. Hmm. So, perhaps there's a recursive pattern here where each term can be expressed in terms of the previous terms, alternating between geometric and arithmetic rules.

Given that the sequence is strictly increasing, each term must be larger than the previous. So, all ratios r_k must be greater than 1 (since each term is larger than the previous, and they are integers, so the ratio can't be 1 or less). Similarly, the common differences d_k must be positive integers.

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Now, let's try to write out the terms step by step in terms of a₁ and see if we can find a pattern or a recursive formula.

<prompt_3.1> Express the first few terms of the sequence in terms of a₁. </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
Let's denote a₁ = x. Then:

For k = 1:
- a₂ = x * r₁ (since it's a geometric sequence)
- a₃ = (a₂²)/a₁ = (x² * r₁²)/x = x * r₁²

For k = 2:
- a₄ = 2a₃ - a₂ = 2(x r₁²) - x r₁ = 2x r₁² - x r₁ = x r₁(2 r₁ - 1)

Then, for k = 2, the geometric sequence is a₃, a₄, a₅. So:
- a₄ / a₃ = (x r₁(2 r₁ - 1)) / (x r₁²) = (2 r₁ - 1)/r₁ = r₂ (the next ratio)
- Therefore, a₅ = a₄ * r₂ = x r₁(2 r₁ - 1) * (2 r₁ - 1)/r₁ = x (2 r₁ - 1)²

Alternatively, since a₅ is also part of the arithmetic sequence for k = 3? Wait, no. For k = 3, the arithmetic sequence would be a₅, a₆, a₇. Wait, maybe not. Let's check.

Wait, for k = 2, the arithmetic sequence is a₄, a₅, a₆. So, a₅ is part of both the geometric sequence for k = 2 and the arithmetic sequence for k = 2. But how does a₅ relate to a₆? From the arithmetic sequence, a₆ = 2a₅ - a₄. So, once we have a₅, we can get a₆. Then, for k = 3, the geometric sequence is a₅, a₆, a₇, so a₇ = (a₆²)/a₅. Then the arithmetic sequence for k = 3 is a₆, a₇, a₈, so a₈ = 2a₇ - a₆, etc.

But this seems complicated because each term depends on previous terms, and the ratios r_k can vary. However, since all terms must be integers, the ratios r_k must be rational numbers. Moreover, since the sequence is strictly increasing, each ratio must be at least 2? Wait, no. For example, if a₁ = 1, a₂ could be 2 (ratio 2), then a₃ = 4, but then a₄ = 2*4 - 2 = 6, which is arithmetic. Then a₅ would be (6²)/4 = 9, which is ratio 1.5 from a₃ to a₄. Wait, but 1.5 is 3/2, which is rational. So, perhaps the ratios can be fractions as long as they result in integer terms.

But since all terms are integers, the ratios must be rational. Let's suppose that each ratio r_k is a rational number p_k / q_k in lowest terms. Then, for a_{2k} / a_{2k-1} = r_k = p_k / q_k, so a_{2k} = a_{2k-1} * p_k / q_k. Since a_{2k} must be an integer, a_{2k-1} must be divisible by q_k. Similarly, the arithmetic sequence gives a_{2k+2} = 2a_{2k+1} - a_{2k}, which is an integer as long as a_{2k+1} and a_{2k} are integers, which they are.

But this seems too abstract. Maybe starting with specific values would help. Let's try to assume that all the ratios r_k are integers. If that's the case, then each term in the geometric sequence is an integer multiple of the previous term. However, the problem doesn't specify that the ratios are integers, just that the terms are integers. So, perhaps the ratios are rational numbers. But maybe starting with integer ratios could lead to a solution, and then we can check if that works.

Alternatively, perhaps all the ratios are the same. Suppose that for all k, r_k = r. Then, maybe the sequence follows a particular pattern. Let's test this hypothesis.

Suppose that for all k, the ratio r is constant. Then:

For k = 1:
- a₁, a₂ = a₁ * r, a₃ = a₂ * r = a₁ * r²

For k = 2:
- The arithmetic sequence gives a₄ = 2a₃ - a₂ = 2a₁ r² - a₁ r = a₁ r (2r - 1)
- Then, the geometric sequence for k = 2 is a₃, a₄, a₅. So, the ratio here would be a₄ / a₃ = (a₁ r (2r - 1)) / (a₁ r²) = (2r - 1)/r. If we assume that this ratio is also r, then:

(2r - 1)/r = r ⇒ 2r - 1 = r² ⇒ r² - 2r + 1 = 0 ⇒ (r - 1)^2 = 0 ⇒ r = 1

But r = 1 would make the geometric sequence constant, which contradicts the strictly increasing condition. Therefore, our assumption that the ratio is constant for all k is invalid. So, the ratios must vary with k.

Therefore, we can't assume a constant ratio. Each ratio r_k can be different. This complicates things, but perhaps we can find a pattern or a recurrence relation.

Let's try to express the terms in terms of a₁.

Starting with a₁ = x.

But let's check if a₁=16 works. Then a₂=32, a₃=64, a₄=128, a₅=192, a₆=256, a₇=320, a₈=384, a₉=512, a₁₀=608, a₁₁=768, a₁₂=896, a₁₃=1024. But wait, the problem says a₁₃=2016, so this is half of that. So, maybe the ratios are different. Wait, but in my initial assumption, I set r=2 each time, but that led to a contradiction because the ratios would have to change. So, perhaps my initial assumption was wrong. Wait, but in the problem, the ratio for the geometric sequence for k=1 is r₁, then for k=2 is r₂, etc. , so each can be different.

Wait, but in my previous calculation, I assumed that each ratio r_k = 2, which led to a contradiction, but perhaps if the ratios are allowed to vary, then it's possible. However, in that case, how do we determine the ratios? Since the problem only gives one condition (a₁₃=2016), we need to find a₁ such that when we apply the rules for geometric and arithmetic sequences alternately, we end up with a₁₃=2016.

But this seems like a forward problem: starting from a₁, compute a₂, a₃, etc. , but since we need a₁₃=2016, perhaps we can work backwards from a₁₃. That might be more efficient.

Let me try that approach. Let's denote the terms as follows:

Based on execution_3.1:
a₁, a₂, a₃, a₄, a₅, a₆, a₇, a₈, a₉, a₁₀, a₁₁, a₁₂, a₁₃.

Given that a₁₃=2016, we need to express a₁ in terms of a₁₃ by reversing the relations.

Let's see. Let's try to express each term in terms of the next terms, working backwards.

Starting from a₁₃:

For k=6:
- The arithmetic sequence a_{11}, a_{12}, a_{13} is arithmetic. So, a_{13} = (a_{12} + a_{12}) / 2? Wait, no. The arithmetic sequence condition is a_{12} - a_{11} = a_{13} - a_{12} ⇒ a_{13} = 2a_{12} - a_{11}.

Similarly, for k=6, the geometric sequence is a_{11}, a_{12}, a_{13}. So, a_{12}/a_{11} = a_{13}/a_{12} ⇒ a_{13} = (a_{12})² / a_{11}.

But since a_{13} is given as 2016, we can write 2016 = (a_{12})² / a_{11} ⇒ a_{11} = (a_{12})² / 2016.

But a_{11} must be an integer, so 2016 must divide (a_{12})². Similarly, from the arithmetic sequence, a_{13} = 2a_{12} - a_{11} ⇒ a_{11} = 2a_{12} - 2016.

Therefore, we have two expressions for a_{11}:
1. a_{11} = (a_{12})² / 2016
2. a_{11} = 2a_{12} - 2016

Setting them equal:
(a_{12})² / 2016 = 2a_{12} - 2016 ⇒ Multiply both sides by 2016:
(a_{12})² = 2016 * 2a_{12} - 2016² ⇒
(a_{12})² - 4032a_{12} + 2016² = 0

This is a quadratic equation in terms of a_{12}:
Let me denote x = a_{12}:
x² - 4032x + 2016² = 0

Solving this quadratic equation:
Discriminant D = (4032)^2 - 4*1*2016² = (4032)^2 - 4*(2016)^2
Factor out (2016)^2:
D = (2016)^2 * [(2)^2 - 4] = (2016)^2 * (4 - 4) = 0

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 4032 is 2*2016, so:

x² - 2*2016*x + (2016)^2 = (x - 2016)^2 = 0 ⇒ x = 2016

But then, a_{12} = 2016. Then from the arithmetic sequence, a_{13} = 2a_{12} - a_{11} ⇒ 2016 = 2*2016 - a_{11} ⇒ a_{11} = 2*2016 - 2016 = 2016. So, a_{11} = a_{12} = a_{13} = 2016. But the sequence is strictly increasing, so this is impossible.

Suppose a₁ = 16. Then:

For k=1:
- a₁ = 16
- Let r₁ = 2, so a₂ = 32
- Then a₃ = (32)^2 / 16 = 64

For k=2:
- The arithmetic sequence: a₄ = 2*64 - 32 = 128
- Then, the geometric sequence for k=2: a₃=64, a₄=128, so ratio r₂ = 128/64 = 2
- Then a₅ = 128 * 2 = 256
- Arithmetic sequence for k=3: a₆ = 2*256 - 128 = 384
- Geometric sequence for k=3: a₅=256, a₆=384, ratio r₃ = 384/256 = 1.5 = 3/2
- Then a₇ = 384 * 1.5 = 576
- Arithmetic sequence for k=4: a₈ = 2*576 - 384 = 768
- Geometric sequence for k=4: a₇=576, a₈=768, ratio r₄ = 768/576 = 1.333... = 4/3
- Then a₉ = 768 * (4/3) = 1024
- Arithmetic sequence for k=5: a₁₀ = 2*1024 - 768 = 1280 - 768 = 512? Wait, 2*1024 = 2048, 2048 - 768 = 1280. So a₁₀=1280
- Geometric sequence for k=5: a₉=1024, a₁₀=1280, ratio r₅ = 1280/1024 = 1.25 = 5/4
- Then a₁₁ = 1280 * (5/4) = 1600
- Arithmetic sequence for k=6: a₁₂ = 2*1600 - 1280 = 3200 - 1280 = 1920
- Geometric sequence for k=6: a₁₁=1600, a₁₂=1920, ratio r₆ = 1920/1600 = 1.2 = 6/5
- Then a₁₃ = 1920 * (6/5) = 2304

But we need a₁₃=2016, so 2304 is too big. Hmm. So, starting with a₁=16 and ratios as 2, 3/2, 4/3, 5/4, 6/5 gives a₁₃=2304. But 2016 is less than that. Maybe the ratios are smaller? But ratios must be greater than 1. Alternatively, maybe the initial ratio is smaller. Let's try with a₁=24.

Wait, maybe this trial and error approach is not efficient. Let's think of another way. Let's try to find a pattern in the terms.

From the arithmetic sequence for k=6:
a_{13} = 2a_{12} - a_{11} ⇒ 2016 = 2a_{12} - a_{11} ⇒ a_{11} = 2a_{12} - 2016.

From the geometric sequence for k=6:
a_{13} = (a_{12}^2)/a_{11} ⇒ 2016 = (a_{12}^2)/a_{11} ⇒ a_{11} = (a_{12}^2)/2016.

Therefore, equating the two expressions for a_{11}:
(a_{12}^2)/2016 = 2a_{12} - 2016 ⇒ Multiply both sides by 2016:
a_{12}^2 = 2016*(2a_{12} - 2016) ⇒
a_{12}^2 - 4032a_{12} + 2016² = 0

This is a quadratic equation in terms of a_{12}. Let's solve it:

a_{12} = [4032 ± sqrt(4032² - 4*1*2016²)] / 2

Calculate discriminant D:
D = (4032)^2 - 4*(2016)^2 = (2016*2)^2 - 4*(2016)^2 = (2016)^2*(4 - 4) = 0

Wait, that can't be right. Let me compute it properly:

Wait, 4032 is 2*2016, so:

D = (2*2016)^2 - 4*(2016)^2 = 4*(2016)^2 - 4*(2016)^2 = 0

So, the discriminant is zero, which means there's one real solution:

a_{12} = [2*2016]/2 = 2016

Therefore, a_{12} = 2016. Then, from the arithmetic sequence:

a_{11} = 2a_{12} - 2016 = 2*2016 - 2016 = 2016

So, a_{11} = 2016 and a_{12} = 2016. But this contradicts the strictly increasing condition, as a_{12} must be greater than a_{11}.

For k=1, ratio r₁=2 (as before)
For k=2, ratio r₂=3/2
For k=3, ratio r₃=4/3
For k=4, ratio r₄=5/4
...
This pattern might continue, with each subsequent ratio being (k+1)/k. If this is the case, then each term a_{2k+1} = a_{2k} * (k+1)/k. But does this hold?

Wait, but in the previous example with a₁=16, this pattern did lead to a contradiction because the final term was 2304 instead of 2016. However, maybe if we adjust the initial term, this pattern could lead us to a₁₃=2016.

Alternatively, maybe the ratios follow a different pattern. Let's try to formalize the relationships.

Suppose that for each k, the ratio r_k = (m + 1)/m for some integer m. Then, starting from a₁, each subsequent term is multiplied by these ratios. However, since the arithmetic sequences impose linear relationships, the ratios can't be arbitrary.

Given the recursive definitions, perhaps we can express a₁₃ in terms of a₁ and set it equal to 2016, then solve for a₁. However, given the complexity, this might be challenging. Alternatively, perhaps the sequence can be expressed in terms of a₁ with a multiplicative factor that can be inverted.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence is such that every six terms, there's a pattern. Wait, but 13 is an odd index, so perhaps the sequence can be broken into blocks. Alternatively, consider that each pair of terms (a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}) defines a geometric sequence, and each pair (a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}) defines an arithmetic sequence. Therefore, the entire sequence is intertwined with both geometric and arithmetic progressions.

Given the complexity, maybe the sequence is a combination of geometric and arithmetic progressions, and perhaps the terms grow exponentially but are adjusted by arithmetic increments. However, this is vague. Let's try to formalize the relationships.

From the geometric sequence condition:

For each k, a_{2k} / a_{2k-1} = a_{2k+1} / a_{2k} ⇒ a_{2k+1} = (a_{2k})² / a_{2k-1}

From the arithmetic sequence condition:

For each k, a_{2k+1} - a_{2k} = a_{2k+2} - a_{2k+1} ⇒ a_{2k+2} = 2a_{2k+1} - a_{2k}

Therefore, starting from a₁, we can express a₂ in terms of a₁, then a₃ in terms of a₁ and a₂, then a₄ in terms of a₂ and a₃, etc. , using these recursive relations.
</execution_6.1>

<execution_6.2>
Alternatively, perhaps there's a recursive formula here. Let me see:

From the geometric sequence:

a_{2k+1} = (a_{2k})² / a_{2k-1}

From the arithmetic sequence:

a_{2k+2} = 2a_{2k+1} - a_{2k}

So, combining these, we can write a recurrence relation. Let's attempt to express a_{n+2} in terms of a_n and a_{n+1}.

Wait, for example, considering the terms a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2}.

From the geometric sequence (a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}):

a_{2k} / a_{2k-1} = a_{2k+1} / a_{2k} ⇒ a_{2k+1} = (a_{2k}^2) / a_{2k-1}

Then, from the arithmetic sequence (a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2}):

a_{2k+1} - a_{2k} = a_{2k+2} - a_{2k+1} ⇒ a_{2k+2} = 2a_{2k+1} - a_{2k}

Substituting a_{2k+1} from above:

a_{2k+2} = 2*(a_{2k}^2 / a_{2k-1}) - a_{2k}

So, this gives a recurrence relation where each even term is defined based on the previous even and odd terms. However, this seems complicated. Maybe we can find a pattern by computing the first few terms in terms of a₁ and a₂.

Let's attempt that. Let's denote a₁ = x, a₂ = y. Then:

a₁ = x

a₂ = y

a₃ = y² / x

a₄ = 2a₃ - a₂ = 2*(y² / x) - y

a₅ = (a₄)^2 / a₃ = [ (2*(y² / x) - y )² ] / (y² / x )

a₆ = 2a₅ - a₄

This is getting quite involved, but perhaps if we assume that the ratios are fractions, we can find a pattern.

Arithmetic sequence: a₄ = 2a₃ - a₂ = 2(a₁ r₁²) - a₁ r₁ = a₁ r₁(2r₁ - 1)

Then, for k=2, the geometric sequence is a₃, a₄, a₅. So:

a₄ / a₃ = a₅ / a₄ ⇒ (a₁ r₁(2r₁ - 1)) / (a₁ r₁²) = (a₅) / (a₁ r₁(2r₁ - 1)) ⇒ (2r₁ - 1)/r₁ = a₅ / (a₁ r₁(2r₁ - 1)) ⇒ a₅ = a₁ r₁(2r₁ - 1) * (2r₁ - 1)/r₁ = a₁ (2r₁ - 1)²

Then, the arithmetic sequence for k=3: a₆ = 2a₅ - a₄ = 2(a₁ (2r₁ - 1)²) - a₁ r₁(2r₁ - 1) = a₁ [2(4r₁² - 4r₁ + 1) - a₁ r₁(2r₁ - 1)] Wait, no, let's compute it step by step:

a₆ = 2a₅ - a₄ = 2*(a₁ (2r₁ - 1)²) - a₁ r₁(2r₁ - 1) = a₁ [2(4r₁² - 4r₁ + 1) - r₁(2r₁ - 1)] = a₁ [8r₁² - 8r₁ + 2 - 2r₁² + r₁] = a₁ [6r₁² - 7r₁ + 2]

Then, for k=3, the geometric sequence is a₅, a₆, a₇. So:

a₆ / a₅ = a₇ / a₆ ⇒ a₇ = (a₆²)/a₅ = [a₁ (2r₁ - 1)²]^2 / [a₁ (2r₁ - 1)^2] Wait, no:

Wait, a₅ = a₁ (2r₁ - 1)^2

a₆ = a₁ [6r₁² - 7r₁ + 2]

Therefore, a₇ = (a₆²)/a₅ = [ (a₁ [6r₁² - 7r₁ + 2])^2 ] / [a₁ (2r₁ - 1)^2 ] = a₁ [ (6r₁² - 7r₁ + 2)^2 / (2r₁ - 1)^2 ]

Then, the arithmetic sequence for k=4: a₈ = 2a₇ - a₆

This is getting very complicated. The expressions are becoming unwieldy, and unless we can find a pattern or a simplification, this approach might not be feasible. Perhaps there's a better way to model the sequence.

Alternative approach: Let's consider that each pair of terms in the geometric sequence is followed by a pair in the arithmetic sequence. Maybe we can model the sequence in terms of blocks. Each block consists of a geometric sequence followed by an arithmetic sequence. However, since the arithmetic sequence uses the last term of the previous geometric sequence, there might be a recursive relationship between the blocks.

Let's define each block as follows:

Block 1: a₁, a₂, a₃ (geometric)

Block 2: a₃, a₄, a₅ (arithmetic)

Block 3: a₅, a₆, a₇ (geometric)

Block 4: a₇, a₈, a₉ (arithmetic)

And so on. Each odd-numbered block is geometric, and each even-numbered block is arithmetic. However, the blocks overlap. For example, a₃ is part of both Block 1 and Block 2. Therefore, the terms are shared between blocks, making it challenging to model them independently.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express each term in terms of the previous term and the ratio. Let's attempt this.

From the geometric sequence condition:

For each k ≥ 1:
a_{2k} / a_{2k-1} = a_{2k+1} / a_{2k} ⇒ a_{2k+1} = (a_{2k}^2)/a_{2k-1}

From the arithmetic sequence condition:
For each k ≥ 1:
a_{2k+2} = 2a_{2k+1} - a_{2k}

So, starting from a₁, we can express a₂ in terms of a₁ and r₁, then a₃ in terms of a₂ and a₁, then a₄ in terms of a₃ and a₂, etc. But since we have 13 terms, this would require a lot of substitutions. However, maybe we can find a pattern or a recursive formula.

Let me attempt to write the first few terms in terms of a₁ and the ratios.

Based on execution_6.1:
Let's try to work through the equations step by step.

We have:

1. a₁₃ = 2016
2. From the backward step for k=6: a₁₃ = 2016, so:



Alternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation in the quadratic step. Let's re-examine:



But since a₁ must be a positive integer, and 2016 is the 13th term, maybe the ratios are fractions. Let's consider that perhaps the ratios are fractions, but the terms are still integers. For example, if a₁ is a multiple of a power of 2, then dividing by 2 might still result in integers.

Alternatively, maybe the ratios are not integers but rational numbers such that when multiplied, they result in integers. For example, if a₁ is a multiple of 2^12, then dividing by 2^12 would still yield an integer. But 2^12 is 4096, which is larger than 2016, so that might not work.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratios are not consistent, and we need to find ratios such that each division results in an integer. For example, if a₁ is a multiple of 2^something. Let's think recursively.

Starting from a₁₃=2016, we can work backwards, ensuring that each division by the ratio is an integer. Let's attempt this.

Let's assume that for each k, r_k = (k + 1)/k. Then:

For k=1: r₁=2/1=2

<prompt_7.2> Calculate the first few terms of the sequence using the identified pattern and check for consistency. </prompt_7.2>
</Plan_7>

<Execution_7>
<execution_7.1>
Let’s denote the ratios for each k as r_k. Then:

a₁₃ = a₁₂ * r₆

But a₁₃ is given as 2016, so:

2016 = a₁₂ * r₆ ⇒ a₁₂ = 2016 / r₆

Similarly, a₁₂ = a₁₁ * r₅ ⇒ a₁₁ = a₁₂ / r₅ = (2016 / r₆) / r₅ = 2016 / (r₅ * r₆)

But a₁₁ must be an integer, so r₅ * r₆ must divide 2016. Similarly, moving back:

a₁₁ = a₁₀ * r₄ ⇒ a₁₀ = a₁₁ / r₄

a₁₀ = a₉ * r₃ ⇒ a₉ = a₁₀ / r₃ = (a₁₁ / r₄) / r₃ = a₁₁ / (r₃ * r₄)

And so on. However, without knowing the ratios r_k, this is difficult. But perhaps there's a pattern in the ratios. Let's hypothesize that the ratios follow a sequence. For example, if each ratio r_k = (k + 1)/k, then:

For k=1: r₁=2/1=2

k=2: r₂=3/2

k=3: r₃=4/3

... 

k=6: r₆=7/6

If this is the case, then:

r₁ * r₂ * r₃ * ... * r₆ = (2/1) * (3/2) * (4/3) * ... * (7/6) = 7/1 = 7

Because all intermediate terms cancel out. Therefore, the product r₁*r₂*...*r₆ = 7.

Therefore, a₁₂ = 2016 / (r₁*r₂*...*r₆) = 2016 / 7 = 288

Then, a₁₁ = a₁₂ / r₅ = 288 / (6/5) = 288 * (5/6) = 240

a₁₀ = a₁₁ / r₄ = 240 / (5/4) = 240 * (4/5) = 192

a₉ = a₁₀ / r₃ = 192 / (4/3) = 192 * (3/4) = 144

a₈ = a₉ / r₂ = 144 / (3/2) = 144 * (2/3) = 96

a₇ = a₈ / r₁ = 96 / 2 = 48

Continuing this pattern:

a₆ = a₇ / r₅ = 48 / (6/5) = 48 * (5/6) = 40

a₅ = a₆ / r₄ = 40 / (5/4) = 40 * (4/5) = 32

a₄ = a₅ / r₃ = 32 / (4/3) = 32 * (3/4) = 24

a₃ = a₄ / r₂ = 24 / (3/2) = 24 * (2/3) = 16

a₂ = a₃ / r₁ = 16 / 2 = 8

a₁ = a₂ / r₀? Wait, but we started with k=1. So, the initial ratio r₁=2 was used to get from a₁ to a₂ and a₃. Therefore, working backwards, we have:

a₁ = 8

But let's verify if this works.
</execution_7.1>

<execution_7.2>
For k=2: r₂=3/2

For k=3: r₃=4/3

And so on. Then, each term a_{2k+1} = a_{2k} * r_k, and a_{2k+2} is determined by the arithmetic sequence. Let's see if this holds.

Starting with a₁:

a₁ = x

a₂ = a₁ * r₁ = x * 2

a₃ = a₂ * r₁ = 2x * 2 = 4x

Then, arithmetic sequence for k=1:

a₄ = 2a₃ - a₂ = 8x - 2x = 6x

Then, for k=2:

a₅ = a₄ * r₂ = 6x * (3/2) = 9x

Arithmetic sequence for k=2:

a₆ = 2a₅ - a₄ = 18x - 6x = 12x

For k=3:

a₇ = a₆ * r₃ = 12x * (4/3) = 16x

Arithmetic sequence for k=3:

a₈ = 2a₇ - a₆ = 32x - 12x = 20x

For k=4:

a₉ = a₈ * r₄ = 20x * (5/4) = 25x

Arithmetic sequence for k=4:

a_{10} = 2a₉ - a₈ = 50x - 20x = 30x

For k=5:

a_{11} = a_{10} * r₅ = 30x * (6/5) = 36x

Arithmetic sequence for k=5:

a_{12} = 2a_{11} - a_{10} = 72x - 30x = 42x

For k=6:

a_{13} = a_{12} * r₆ = 42x * (7/6) = 49x

But according to the problem, a₁₃=2016, so 49x=2016 ⇒ x=2016/49=41.1428... Which is not an integer.

Based on execution_7.2:
But this contradicts the requirement that all terms are integers.

Hmm. So, this approach leads to a non-integer a₁, which is invalid. Therefore, the assumption that the ratios follow r_k = (k+1)/k might be incorrect, even though it simplifies the product of ratios to 7, leading to a₁=8, but that doesn't satisfy the final term.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratios are not following that pattern. Let's consider that maybe the ratios are different. Let's go back to the initial equations.

<Execution_8>
<execution_8.1>
Starting from a₁, we have:

a₁ = x

a₂ = r₁ x

a₃ = r₁² x

a₄ = x r₁ (2 r₁ - 1)

a₅ = x (2 r₁ - 1)²

a₆ = x (2 r₁ - 1) (2 r₁² - 2 r₁ + 1)

a₇ = x (2 r₁² - 2 r₁ + 1) (2 r₁ - 1)

a₈ = x (2 r₁² - 2 r₁ + 1) (4 r₁ - 4)

a₉ = x (4 r₁ - 4) (2 r₁² - 2 r₁ + 1)

a₁₀ = x (4 r₁ - 4) (4 r₁² - 4 r₁ + 2)

a₁₁ = x (4 r₁² - 4 r₁ + 2) (4 r₁ - 4)

a₁₂ = x (4 r₁² - 4 r₁ + 2) (8 r₁ - 8)

a₁₃ = x (8 r₁ - 8) (4 r₁² - 4 r₁ + 2)

Given that a₁₃ = 2016, so:

x (8 r₁ - 8) (4 r₁² - 4 r₁ + 2) = 2016

Simplify:

x * 8(r₁ - 1) * 2(2 r₁² - 2 r₁ + 1) = 2016

So,

x * 16 (r₁ - 1)(2 r₁² - 2 r₁ + 1) = 2016

Therefore,

x = 2016 / [16 (r₁ - 1)(2 r₁² - 2 r₁ + 1)]

Simplify denominator:

16 (r₁ - 1)(2 r₁² - 2 r₁ + 1)

Thus,

x = 126 / [ (r₁ - 1)(2 r₁² - 2 r₁ + 1) ]

<Plan_9>
Based on execution_8.1:
For x to be an integer, the denominator must divide 126. Let's factorize 126:

126 = 2 × 3² × 7

Possible factors of 126: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, 14, 18, 21, 42, 63, 126

Therefore, (r₁ - 1)(2 r₁² - 2 r₁ + 1) must be a divisor of 126. Since r₁ is a rational number (as a₁ and a₂ are integers, r₁ = a₂/a₁ must be rational), let's denote r₁ = p/q where p and q are integers with no common factors.

<execution_9.1>
Then,

(r₁ - 1)(2 r₁² - 2 r₁ + 1) = (p/q - 1)(2 (p/q)² - 2 (p/q) + 1) = [(p - q)/q][ (2 p² - 2 p q + q²)/q² ] = (p - q)(2 p² - 2 p q + q²)/q³

This must divide 126, so the numerator (p - q)(2 p² - 2 p q + q²) must be divisible by q³. However, this seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe r₁ is an integer. Let's test r₁ = 2.

If r₁ = 2:

Then,

x = 126 / [ (2 - 1)(2*(2)^2 - 2*2 + 1) ] = 126 / [1*(8 - 4 + 1)] = 126 / 5 = 25.2

Not an integer. Next, r₁ = 3:

x = 126 / [ (3 - 1)(2*9 - 6 + 1) ] = 126 / [2*(18 - 6 + 1)] = 126 / [2*13] = 126 / 26 ≈ 4.846. Not integer.

r₁ = 1.5 (3/2):

x = 126 / [ (1.5 - 1)(2*(1.5)^2 - 2*1.5 + 1) ] = 126 / [0.5*(2*2.25 - 3 + 1)] = 126 / [0.5*(4.5 - 3 + 1)] = 126 / [0.5*2.5] = 126 / 1.25 = 100.8. Not integer.

r₁ = 1. Let's see, but r₁ =1 would make the sequence undefined because we have (r₁ -1) in the denominator, which would be zero. So r₁ cannot be 1.

r₁ = 4:

x = 126 / [ (4 -1)(2*16 - 8 +1) ] = 126 / [3*(32 -8 +1)] = 126 / [3*25] = 126 /75 = 1.68. Not integer.

r₁ = 1.2 (6/5):

x = 126 / [ (6/5 -1)(2*(6/5)^2 - 2*(6/5) +1) ] = 126 / [ (1/5)(2*(36/25) - 12/5 +1) ] = 126 / [ (1/5)(72/25 - 60/25 + 25/25) ] = 126 / [ (1/5)(37/25) ] = 126 / (37/125) = 126 * (125/37) ≈ 425.945. Not integer.

This approach might not be effective. Let's consider another angle. Since the problem gives a₁₃=2016, and we need to find a₁, perhaps we can work backwards, expressing a₁ in terms of a₁₃ and the ratios.

Starting from a₁₃ = 2016, and working back:

</execution_9.1>

<execution_9.2>
Then, x = 126 / [(2 - 1)(2*(2)^2 - 2*2 + 1)] = 126 / [1*(8 - 4 + 1)] = 126 / 5 = 25.2, which is not an integer. So, invalid.

If r₁ = 3/2:

Then, (r₁ - 1) = 1/2

2 r₁² - 2 r₁ + 1 = 2*(9/4) - 3 + 1 = 18/4 - 3 + 1 = 4.5 - 3 + 1 = 2.5 = 5/2

Thus, denominator = (1/2)*(5/2) = 5/4

x = 126 / (5/4) = 126 * (4/5) = 100.8, not an integer.
</execution_9.2>

<execution_9.3>
Then denominator:

(r₁ - 1)(2 r₁² - 2 r₁ + 1) = 2*(2*9 - 2*3 +1)=2*(18-6+1)=2*13=26

Thus, x=126/26=63/13≈4.846, not integer.

r₁=4:

Denominator: 3*(2*16 -2*4 +1)=3*(32-8+1)=3*25=75

x=126/75=1.68, not integer.

r₁=1.5:

Then r₁=3/2. Let's compute denominator:

(r₁ -1)(2 r₁² -2 r₁ +1)= (0.5)(2*(2.25) -2*(1.5)+1)=0.5*(4.5 -3 +1)=0.5*2.5=1.25

Thus, x=126 /1.25=100.8, not integer.

r₁=1.25:

Then r₁=5/4. Denominator:

(5/4 -1)(2*(25/16) -2*(5/4)+1)= (1/4)(50/16 -10/4 +1)= (1/4)(2.8125 -2.5 +1)= (1/4)(1.3125)=0.328125

<Execution_10>
<execution_10.1>
From earlier:

a₁₃ = x * 16 (r₁ - 1)(2 r₁² - 2 r₁ + 1) = 2016

Thus, x = 2016 / [16 (r₁ - 1)(2 r₁² - 2 r₁ + 1)] = 126 / [(r₁ - 1)(2 r₁² - 2 r₁ + 1)]

So, (r₁ - 1)(2 r₁² - 2 r₁ + 1) must divide 126. Since 126 factors into 2×3×3×7, possible values for the denominator are the divisors of 126. However, since (r₁ -1) and (2 r₁² - 2 r₁ +1) are likely to be integers if r₁ is rational, we need to find rational r₁ such that the product is a divisor of 126.

Then,

(r₁ -1) = (p/q -1) = (p - q)/q

2 r₁² - 2 r₁ +1 = 2(p/q)^2 - 2(p/q) +1 = (2p² - 2pq + q²)/q²

Thus, the product:

(r₁ -1)(2 r₁² - 2 r₁ +1) = [(p - q)/q] * [(2p² - 2pq + q²)/q²] = (p - q)(2p² - 2pq + q²)/q³

This must divide 126, so (p - q)(2p² - 2pq + q²) must be divisible by q³, and the result must be a divisor of 126.

However, this approach is quite involved. Instead, perhaps we can consider possible integer values for r₁. Let's try r₁ = 3/2 again.

Wait, when r₁ = 3/2, let's recompute the denominator:

(r₁ -1)(2 r₁² - 2 r₁ +1) = (1/2)(2*(9/4) - 2*(3/2) +1) = (1/2)(18/4 - 6/2 +1) = (1/2)(4.5 - 3 +1) = (1/2)(2.5) = 1.25

So, x = 126 / 1.25 = 100.8, which is not an integer. So, invalid.
