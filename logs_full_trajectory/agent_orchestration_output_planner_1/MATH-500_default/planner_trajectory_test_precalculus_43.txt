</Question>

<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to find the point that the curve passes through when t is 2. The curve is given in parametric equations: x is a function of t, which is t cubed plus 7, and y is another function of t, which is -3t squared minus 6t minus 5. Alright, let me break this down step by step.

First, parametric equations define x and y in terms of a third variable, which here is t. So, for any value of t, plugging it into these equations will give me a corresponding (x, y) point on the curve. The question is asking for the specific point when t equals 2. That sounds straightforward, but I want to make sure I don't make any calculation errors. Let me start with the x-coordinate.

For the x-component, the equation is x = t³ + 7. So, substituting t = 2 into this, I get x = (2)³ + 7. Let me calculate that.
2 cubed is 8, right? So 8 plus 7 is 15. So, x should be 15 when t is 2.

Now, moving on to the y-component.
The equation given is y = -3t² - 6t - 5. Again, substituting t = 2 here. Let me compute each term step by step to avoid mistakes.

Wait, just to be thorough, maybe I can check if the parametric equations make sense. For example, is there a possibility that the curve could pass through the same point at a different t value? But the question specifically asks for t = 2, so even if other t values give the same point, that's irrelevant here. But just to check, maybe plug in t = 2 into the equations again.

<prompt_1.2> Re-evaluate the calculations for x and y by substituting t = 2 into the equations to ensure accuracy. </prompt_1.2>

Alternatively, maybe I can visualize the curve a bit. The x-component is a cubic function in t, which is going to have a certain shape, while the y-component is a quadratic function, which is a parabola.

<prompt_1.3> Discuss the nature of the parametric equations and how they relate to the point found at t = 2. </prompt_1.3>

First, compute t squared: 2 squared is 4. Then multiply by -3: -3 times 4 is -12. Next, compute -6 times t, which is -6 times 2, giving -12. Then, subtract 5. So, adding up all those terms: -12 (from the first term) plus (-12) (from the second term) plus (-5) (from the third term). Wait, that would be -12 -12 -5. Let me add them step by step. 

First, -12 -12 is -24. Then, -24 -5 is -29. So, y should be -29 when t is 2.

<execution_1.2>
x = (2)^3 + 7. 2^3 is 8, plus 7 is 15. Correct. For y: -3*(2)^2 is -3*4 = -12. Then -6*(2) is -12. Then -5. So adding them up: -12 -12 -5. Let's see, -12 -12 is -24, minus 5 is -29.

<execution_1.3>
Since the coefficient of t² in y is negative, the parabola opens downward. So as t increases, the y-coordinate will first decrease, reach a minimum, then increase. But since we're only evaluating at t = 2, maybe that's just extra information, but it helps in understanding the curve's behavior.

Based on execution_1.1:
Wait, let me verify that again to be sure. Maybe I miscalculated the y-component. Let's do it step by step again.

Based on execution_1.1, execution_1.2:
Alternatively, maybe I can consider if there's a different way to approach the problem. For example, could I eliminate the parameter t and find a Cartesian equation? But since the question is just asking for the point at t = 2, that might be unnecessary. However, for practice, let me try that approach to see if it confirms my answer.

To eliminate the parameter t, I need to express t in terms of x from the x equation and then substitute into the y equation.

<prompt_2.2> Explore the possibility of eliminating the parameter t to find a Cartesian equation and check if it confirms the point found at t = 2. </prompt_2.2>

The formula for y is -3t² -6t -5. Plugging in t = 2:

First term: -3*(2)^2 = -3*4 = -12.

Second term: -6*(2) = -12.

Third term: -5.

Adding them: -12 -12 -5. So, -12 -12 is -24, then -24 -5 is indeed -29.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
From x = t³ + 7, we can solve for t: t³ = x - 7, so t = (x - 7)^(1/3). Then substitute that into the equation for y. So y = -3[(x - 7)^(1/3)]² - 6[(x - 7)^(1/3)] - 5. That seems complicated, but maybe I can plug x = 15 into this equation to see if y gives -29.

Let's try that. If x = 15, then t = (15 - 7)^(1/3) = 8^(1/3) = 2. Then substitute t = 2 into the y equation: y = -3*(2)^2 -6*(2) -5 = -3*4 -12 -5 = -12 -12 -5 = -29.

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.2:
But wait, is this helpful? Maybe not directly, but it confirms that when x is 15, t is 2, which gives y as -29.
So, the point (15, -29) is on the curve. 

Alternatively, if I didn't eliminate the parameter, and just directly substituted t = 2 into both equations, which is the straightforward approach.
That's probably the best method here. Let's do that again:

<prompt_3.1> Re-evaluate the point by directly substituting t = 2 into both parametric equations to confirm the result. </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
x = (2)^3 + 7. 2 cubed is 8, plus 7 is 15. 

y = -3*(2)^2 -6*(2) -5. Calculating each term:

-3*(4) = -12,

-6*(2) = -12,

Then -5.

Adding them: -12 -12 -5 = -29.

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
Therefore, the point is (15, -29). 

Wait, just to make sure, maybe I can check if I misread the equations. Let me look again.

<prompt_4.1> Confirm the solution by ensuring the equations were not misread and verifying the calculations for x and y. </prompt_4.1>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
The problem states:

(x, y) = (t³ + 7, -3t² -6t -5).

Yes, so x is t cubed plus 7, and y is -3t squared minus 6t minus 5. So, no, I didn't misread the equations. So substituting t=2 into both gives x=15 and y=-29.
</execution_4.1>
</Execution_4>

<Final_answer>
Therefore, the point the curve passes through at $t = 2$ is $\boxed{(15, -29)}$.
