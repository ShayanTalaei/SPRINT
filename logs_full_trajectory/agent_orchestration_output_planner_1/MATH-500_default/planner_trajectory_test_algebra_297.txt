</Question>

<think>
<Plan_1>
Okay, let's see. I need to find the product of the y-coordinates of all the distinct solutions (x, y) for the two equations y = x² - 8 and y² = -5x + 44. Hmm, so first, maybe I should solve these equations simultaneously. Since the first equation gives y in terms of x, I can substitute that into the second equation. Let me try that.

So, substituting y = x² - 8 into the second equation, which is y² = -5x + 44. That would give (x² - 8)² = -5x + 44. Expanding the left side, (x² - 8)² is x⁴ - 16x² + 64. So the equation becomes x⁴ - 16x² + 64 = -5x + 44.

<prompt_1.1> Expand and simplify the equation (x² - 8)² = -5x + 44 to a polynomial form. </prompt_1.1>

But wait, the problem says "all the distinct solutions (x, y)". So, does that mean there might be some solutions where the x-values are the same but y-values different? But in this case, since we substituted y from the first equation into the second, each x corresponds to only one y. So each solution (x, y) is unique.
So four solutions as per the roots. But maybe some of them have same x but different y? No, because y is determined uniquely by x. So each x gives one y. Hence, four distinct solutions. So their y-coordinates are the four roots of the quartic equation, and their product is 64. So the answer is 64. But let me think again.

Wait, but sometimes when you have a system of equations, especially with higher degrees, you might have multiple solutions with same x but different y if the equations allow. But here, the first equation is y = x² - 8, which is a function, so each x gives exactly one y. Therefore, the second equation y² = -5x +44 can have two y's for a given x (if real solutions exist), but since we are substituting y from the first equation into the second, each x will give only one y. Therefore, the solutions are indeed four distinct points, each with unique x (but maybe some x repeat? ), but in this case, the quartic equation factors into (x - 2)^2 (x + 3)^2, so x = 2 and x = -3 each with multiplicity 2. Wait, but does that mean there are two distinct x's, each with multiplicity 2? So the solutions would be (2, y1), (2, y2), (-3, y3), (-3, y4). But wait, substituting x = 2 into y = x² -8 gives y = 4 -8 = -4. So both y1 and y2 would be -4? Similarly, x = -3 gives y = 9 -8 = 1. So both y3 and y4 would be 1. Therefore, the four solutions are (2, -4), (2, -4), (-3, 1), (-3, 1). But the problem says "distinct solutions".

<prompt_1.2> Determine the distinct solutions from the roots of the quartic equation. </prompt_1.2>

Wait, but the problem says "distinct solutions (x, y)", so even if x is the same but y is different, they are considered distinct. But in this case, for x = 2, y is uniquely determined as -4, so there's only one y. Similarly for x = -3, y is 1. Therefore, the distinct solutions are (2, -4) and (-3, 1). So two solutions. Then the product of the y-coordinates would be (-4) * 1 = -4. But this contradicts the previous conclusion.

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
Then, moving all terms to the left side, we have x⁴ - 16x² + 64 + 5x - 44 = 0. Simplifying the constants: 64 - 44 is 20. So the equation becomes x⁴ - 16x² + 5x + 20 = 0.
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
So (2, -4) and (-3, 1) each with multiplicity 2, but as distinct solutions, they are two solutions. Wait, but in the original system, when we substitute, we get a quartic equation which factors into (x - 2)^2 (x + 3)^2 = 0, so x = 2 and x = -3 each with multiplicity 2. But since each x gives only one y, then the solutions are (2, -4) and (-3, 1), each with multiplicity 2. But in terms of distinct solutions, (2, -4) and (-3, 1) are two distinct solutions. So maybe the problem considers multiplicity? No, the problem says "distinct solutions", so multiplicity doesn't matter. So only two distinct solutions. Then the y-coordinates are -4 and 1, product is -4. But this contradicts the previous conclusion.

Based on execution_1.1:
Hmm, quartic equations can be tricky. Maybe I can factor this equation. Let me try to see if there are any rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. Possible rational roots are factors of 20 over factors of 1, so ±1, ±2, ±4, ±5, ±10, ±20.
Let me test x = 1: 1 - 16 + 5 + 20 = 1 -16 is -15, +5 is -10, +20 is 10 ≠ 0. x = -1: 1 -16 -5 +20 = 0? 1 -16 = -15, -5 = -20, +20 = 0. Oh, x = -1 is a root.

So (x + 1) is a factor. Let's perform polynomial division or use synthetic division.

Using synthetic division with x = -1:

Bring down 1. Multiply by -1: -1. Add to next coefficient: 0 + (-1) = -1. Multiply by -1: 1. Add to next coefficient: -16 +1 = -15. Multiply by -1: 15. Add to next coefficient: 5 +15 = 20. Multiply by -1: -20. Add to last coefficient: 20 + (-20) = 0. So the quotient is x³ - x² -15x -20.

So now, we have (x + 1)(x³ - x² -15x -20) = 0. Let's try to factor the cubic. Again, using Rational Root Theorem on the cubic: possible roots are ±1, ±2, ±4, ±5, ±10, ±20.

Bring down 1. Multiply by -2: -2. Add to next coefficient: -1 + (-2) = -3. Multiply by -2: 6. Add to next coefficient: -15 +6 = -9. Multiply by -2: 18. Add to last coefficient: -20 +18 = -2. Wait, that gives a remainder of -2. Hmm, that's not zero. Wait, did I calculate correctly? Let's check:

Wait, if x = -2 is a root, then substituting into the cubic: (-2)^3 - (-2)^2 -15*(-2) -20 = -8 -4 +30 -20 = (-12) +30 = 18 -20 = -2. So remainder is -2. So x = -2 is not a root. Wait, but I thought when I tested x = -2 earlier, I thought it was a root. Wait, maybe I miscalculated. Let me check again.

Wait, original cubic: x³ - x² -15x -20. Let me plug x = -2: (-2)^3 - (-2)^2 -15*(-2) -20 = -8 -4 +30 -20 = (-12) +30 = 18 -20 = -2. So remainder is -2, so x = -2 is not a root. So my mistake earlier. So x = -2 is not a root.

Wait, but Rational Root Theorem says possible roots are integers dividing 20, so maybe no other rational roots. So perhaps the cubic is irreducible over rationals.

But maybe there's a mistake in my earlier steps. Let me go back.

<prompt_6.1> Review the steps to ensure the quartic equation is correct. </prompt_6.1>
</Plan_6>

<Execution_6>
<execution_6.1>
Original equations: y = x² -8 and y² = -5x +44. Substitute y into second equation: (x² -8)^2 = -5x +44. Expand left side: x⁴ -16x² +64. So equation is x⁴ -16x² +64 = -5x +44. Bring all terms to left: x⁴ -16x² +5x +20 =0. That seems correct. Then factoring: found x=-1 is a root. Then cubic x³ -x² -15x -20. Testing x= -1: remainder -7. x= -2: remainder -2. x=4: -32. x=5:5. So maybe there is a real root between 4 and5? Since at x=4, value is -32, x=5 is 5. So by Intermediate Value Theorem, there is a real root between 4 and5. Similarly, maybe another real root. But since the problem is likely constructed to have nice solutions, maybe I made a mistake in substitution. Let me check substitution again.

Wait, maybe I should have considered that when solving (x² -8)^2 = -5x +44, perhaps expanding correctly? Let's check:

(x² -8)^2 = x⁴ -16x² +64. Then, setting equal to -5x +44: x⁴ -16x² +64 +5x -44 =0 → x⁴ -16x² +5x +20=0. Correct. So the equation is correct.

<Plan_7>
Based on execution_6.1:
Alternatively, maybe the quartic can be factored into quadratics. Let me try that. Suppose x⁴ -16x² +5x +20 = (x² + ax + b)(x² + cx + d). Let's expand the right side: x⁴ + (a + c)x³ + (ac + b + d)x² + (ad + bc)x + bd. Set equal to x⁴ -16x² +5x +20. Therefore, equate coefficients:

<prompt_7.1> Factor the quartic equation into quadratics and solve for the coefficients. </prompt_7.1>
</Plan_7>

<Execution_7>
<execution_7.1>
1. a + c = 0 (coefficient of x³)
2. ac + b + d = -16 (coefficient of x²)
3. ad + bc = 5 (coefficient of x)
4. bd = 20 (constant term)

From equation 1: c = -a.

Substitute c = -a into equation 2: a*(-a) + b + d = -a² + b + d = -16.

Equation 4: bd = 20. Possible integer pairs (b,d): (1,20), (2,10), (4,5), (-1,-20), (-2,-10), (-4,-5), (5,4), (10,2), (20,1), etc. Let's try some.

Let's assume b and d are integers. Let's try b=5, d=4. Then bd=20. Then equation 4 is satisfied.

Then equation 2 becomes -a² +5 +4 = -a² +9 = -16 → -a² = -25 → a²=25 → a=5 or -5.

Then c = -a. Let's take a=5, c=-5.

Now equation 3: ad + bc =5*4 +5*(-5) =20 -25 = -5 ≠5. Not good.

Alternatively, a=-5, c=5.

Equation 3: ad + bc = (-5)*4 + (-5)*(-5) = -20 +25=5. That works!

So a=-5, c=5, b=5, d=4.

Therefore, the quartic factors as (x² -5x +5)(x² +5x +4). Let's check:

Multiply (x² -5x +5)(x² +5x +4):

= x²(x² +5x +4) -5x(x² +5x +4) +5(x² +5x +4)

= x⁴ +5x³ +4x² -5x³ -25x² -20x +5x² +25x +20

Combine like terms:

x⁴ + (5x³ -5x³) + (4x² -25x² +5x²) + (-20x +25x) +20

= x⁴ +0x³ +(-16x²) +5x +20.

Yes! That matches the original quartic. So the quartic factors into (x² -5x +5)(x² +5x +4) =0.

Therefore, the solutions are the roots of x² -5x +5=0 and x² +5x +4=0.

Solving x² +5x +4=0: discriminant D=25 -16=9. Solutions: x=(-5 ±3)/2. So x=(-5+3)/2= -1, and x=(-5-3)/2= -4. So x= -1 and x= -4.

So two irrational roots. Therefore, all solutions for x are x= -1, x= -4, x=(5 +√5)/2, x=(5 -√5)/2.

Therefore, the distinct x-values are four: -4, -1, (5 +√5)/2, (5 -√5)/2. Then, for each x, compute y from y =x² -8.

So:

1. x = -4: y = (-4)^2 -8 =16 -8=8.

2. x = -1: y = (-1)^2 -8=1 -8=-7.

3. x=(5 +√5)/2: y = [(5 +√5)/2]^2 -8.

Let's compute that. First, square the term:

[(5 +√5)/2]^2 = (25 +10√5 +5)/4 = (30 +10√5)/4 = (15 +5√5)/2. Then subtract 8: (15 +5√5)/2 -8 = (15 +5√5 -16)/2 = (-1 +5√5)/2.

Similarly, for x=(5 -√5)/2: y = [(5 -√5)/2]^2 -8.

Compute the square:

[(5 -√5)/2]^2 = (25 -10√5 +5)/4 = (30 -10√5)/4 = (15 -5√5)/2. Subtract 8: (15 -5√5)/2 -8 = (15 -5√5 -16)/2 = (-1 -5√5)/2.

Therefore, the four solutions are:

(-4, 8), (-1, -7), ((5 +√5)/2, (-1 +5√5)/2), ((5 -√5)/2, (-1 -5√5)/2).

Therefore, the distinct y-coordinates are 8, -7, (-1 +5√5)/2, and (-1 -5√5)/2.

Now, the problem asks for the product of these y-coordinates. So we need to compute 8 * (-7) * [(-1 +5√5)/2] * [(-1 -5√5)/2].

First, compute 8 * (-7) = -56.

Then, compute the product of the two fractions: [(-1 +5√5)/2] * [(-1 -5√5)/2]. This is of the form (a + b)(a - b) = a² - b². Here, a = -1/2, b = (5√5)/2. Wait, actually, let me write it properly.

Wait, [(-1 +5√5)/2] * [(-1 -5√5)/2] = [(-1)^2 - (5√5)^2]/(2^2) = [1 - (25*5)]/4 = [1 -125]/4 = (-124)/4 = -31.

Therefore, the product of all four y-coordinates is (-56) * (-31) = 56*31.

Compute 56*31: 50*31=1550, 6*31=186, so total is 1550 +186=1736.

Wait, 56*30=1680, plus 56=1736. Yes. So 56*31=1736.

Therefore, the product of the y-coordinates is 1736.

First, factoring the quartic equation: correct. Then solving the quadratics:

x² +5x +4=0: correct roots x=-1 and x=-4.

x² -5x +5=0: discriminant 25 -20=5, roots (5 ±√5)/2: correct.

Calculating y for each x:

x=-4: y=16-8=8: correct.

x=-1: y=1-8=-7: correct.

x=(5 +√5)/2: compute y:

First, square: [(5 +√5)/2]^2 = (25 +10√5 +5)/4 = 30 +10√5 over 4, which simplifies to (15 +5√5)/2. Then subtract 8: (15 +5√5)/2 - 16/2 = (-1 +5√5)/2: correct.

Similarly for the other root: (-1 -5√5)/2: correct.

Then, product: 8 * (-7) * [(-1 +5√5)/2] * [(-1 -5√5)/2].

Compute the product of the two fractions:

[(-1 +5√5)/2] * [(-1 -5√5)/2] = [(-1)^2 - (5√5)^2]/4 = [1 - 25*5]/4 = [1 -125]/4 = (-124)/4 = -31: correct.

Then 8 * (-7) = -56. Then -56 * (-31) = 1736: correct.

So the product is 1736.

Since the y-coordinates are derived from the solutions of the quartic equation, which factors into two quadratics. The product of all y's would be the product of the y's from each quadratic factor.

Wait, but each quadratic corresponds to two x's, each with their own y. So perhaps the product of all y's is the product of the y's from each quadratic. Let's see.

For the quadratic x² +5x +4=0, the roots are x=-1 and x=-4. Their y's are -7 and 8. The product of these y's is (-7)*8 = -56.

For the quadratic x² -5x +5=0, the roots are x=(5 ±√5)/2. Their y's are [(-1 +5√5)/2] and [(-1 -5√5)/2]. The product of these two y's is [(-1 +5√5)/2] * [(-1 -5√5)/2] = (-1)^2 - (5√5)^2)/4 = (1 - 125)/4 = -124/4 = -31. Then, the total product is (-56)*(-31)=1736: same result. So that's another way to see it. Using Vieta's formula for the product of the roots of the quadratic in x, but transformed into y. Hmm, not sure if directly applicable, but the calculation checks out.

Alternatively, if we consider the original equations, maybe there's a way to relate the product of y's without computing each one. But given the complexity of the roots, especially with the irrational numbers, it's unlikely. So the step-by-step computation seems necessary. Therefore, the answer should be 1736.

Alternatively, 31*56: 30*56=1680, 1*56=56, total 1680+56=1736. Correct.
