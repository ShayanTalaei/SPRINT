Okay, let's see. I need to find the value of (26² - 24² - 10)² - 10². Hmm, that looks like a combination of squares and subtraction. Maybe there's a way to simplify it without calculating each term individually. Let me think step by step.

First, let me break down the expression. The main part is (26² - 24² - 10) squared, and then subtract 10² from it. So, if I can compute the inner part first, that might help.

Looking at 26² - 24², that seems like a difference of squares. Remember, the difference of squares formula is a² - b² = (a - b)(a + b). Maybe I can apply that here.

Let's try that. Let a = 26 and b = 24. Then, 26² - 24² = (26 - 24)(26 + 24). Calculating the terms inside the parentheses: 26 - 24 is 2, and 26 + 24 is 50. So, multiplying those gives 2 * 50 = 100. So, 26² - 24² simplifies to 100.

Based on execution_1.1:
Now, subtract 10 from that result. So, 100 - 10 = 90. Then, we need to square that result. So, (90)². Let me compute that.
90 squared is 8100. Because 9 squared is 81, and then adding two zeros gives 8100. So, (26² - 24² - 10)² is 8100.

Now, the next part is subtracting 10². 10 squared is 100. So, the entire expression becomes 8100 - 100. That's straightforward.

<prompt_2.1> Subtract 100 from 8100 to find the final result. </prompt_2.1>

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me verify each step again.

<prompt_2.2> Re-verify each step of the calculation to ensure accuracy. </prompt_2.2>

Alternatively, maybe I can check using another method. Let's compute each term step by step without using the difference of squares.

So, 8100 minus 100 is 8000. Therefore, the value should be 8000.

First step: 26 squared. 26*26. Let me calculate that. 20*20=400, 20*6=120, 6*20=120, 6*6=36. So, (20+6)² = 20² + 2*20*6 + 6² = 400 + 240 + 36 = 676. So, 26² is 676. Then 24 squared. 24*24. Similarly, (20+4)² = 20² + 2*20*4 + 4² = 400 + 160 + 16 = 576. So, 24² is 576. Then, 676 - 576 = 100. That checks out. Then subtract 10: 100 - 10 = 90. Squared: 90*90. 90*90 is 8100. Then subtract 100: 8100 - 100 = 8000.

26 squared is 26*26. Let me calculate that. 20*20=400, 20*6=120, 6*20=120, 6*6=36. So, 400 + 120 + 120 + 36 = 676. So, 26²=676. Then 24 squared. 24*24. 20*20=400, 20*4=80, 4*20=80, 4*4=16. So, 400 + 80 + 80 +16= 576. So, 24²=576. Then subtract those: 676 - 576 = 100. Then subtract 10: 100 -10=90. Square that: 90*90=8100. Then subtract 100: 8100-100=8000.

Therefore, the value of the given expression is $\boxed{8000}$.
