Okay, so I need to convert the fraction 3/20 into a decimal. Let me think about how to do this. I remember that fractions can be turned into decimals by dividing the numerator by the denominator. So in this case, I need to divide 3 by 20. But wait, 3 is smaller than 20, so the decimal will start with 0. something. Hmm, how does that work exactly?

Let me recall. When you divide a smaller number by a larger one, you add a decimal point and then add zeros to the dividend until the division is possible. So here, 3 divided by 20. Let me write this out as long division.

20 ) 3.000

First, 20 goes into 3 zero times. So we write 0. and then proceed. Then, we consider 30 (after adding a decimal point and a zero). How many times does 20 go into 30? Once, because 20 times 1 is 20. Subtract 20 from 30, we get 10. Bring down the next zero, making it 100. Now, how many times does 20 go into 100? Five times exactly, because 20 times 5 is 100. Subtracting 100 from 100 gives zero. There's no remainder, so the division stops here.

Based on execution_1.1:
Putting that together, we had 0. (from the first step), then 1 in the tenths place, and 5 in the hundredths place.
So 3/20 as a decimal is 0.15.

Let me check that. If I multiply 0.15 by 20, I should get 3.

<prompt_2.1> Multiply 0.15 by 20 to verify it equals 3. </prompt_2.1>

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to think about it. Since 20 is a factor of 100, maybe I can adjust the denominator to make it 100, which would make the conversion to decimal easier. Let's see. The denominator is 20, so what do I multiply 20 by to get 100?

<prompt_2.2> Convert 3/20 to a decimal by adjusting the denominator to 100. </prompt_2.2>

Another way to check: maybe using equivalent fractions. If I can find an equivalent fraction of 3/20 with a denominator that's a power of 10, since decimals are base 10. The closest power of 10 to 20 is 100 (10 squared). So as before, multiplying numerator and denominator by 5 gives 15/100, which is 0.15.
So that's consistent.

Alternatively, maybe using fractions to decimals conversion rules. For example, since the denominator is 20, which factors into 2^2 * 5, the decimal should terminate after a certain number of digits. The number of digits after the decimal point would be the maximum of the exponents in the prime factorization of the denominator. Wait, the denominator here is 20, which is 2^2 * 5^1. So the maximum exponent is 2, so the decimal would terminate after 2 digits. Which matches our result of 0.15.

Let me verify once more by converting 0.15 back to a fraction.
0.15 is the same as 15/100. Simplifying that by dividing numerator and denominator by 5 gives 3/20.

Is there a possibility I made a mistake in the long division? Let me go through that again.

<prompt_2.3> Re-evaluate the long division of 3 divided by 20 to ensure accuracy. </prompt_2.3>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
0.15 times 20: 0.1 times 20 is 2, and 0.05 times 20 is 1. So 2 + 1 = 3.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
5, because 20 times 5 is 100. Then, I multiply the numerator and denominator by 5. So 3 times 5 is 15, and 20 times 5 is 100. So 3/20 becomes 15/100. And 15/100 as a decimal is 0.15.
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
20 into 3.0. 20 doesn't go into 3, so we write 0. Then 20 into 30 (after adding a decimal and a zero). 20 goes into 30 once (1), write 1 after the decimal. Multiply 1 by 20, subtract from 30, remainder 10. Bring down the next zero to make 100. 20 goes into 100 five times (5). Write 5 next to the 1. Multiply 5 by 20, get 100, subtract from 100, remainder 0. So yes, 0.15.

<Final_answer>
Therefore, the decimal equivalent of $\frac{3}{20}$ is $\boxed{0.15}$.
