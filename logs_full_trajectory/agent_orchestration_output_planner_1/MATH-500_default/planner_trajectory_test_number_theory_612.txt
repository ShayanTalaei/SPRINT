<Question>
Zach has three bags and a bunch of pencils to be placed into the bags. He is told to place the greatest number of pencils possible into each of the three bags while also keeping the number of pencils in each bag the same. What is the greatest number of pencils he could have left over?

Okay, so Zach has three bags and wants to put as many pencils as possible into each bag, making sure all three bags have the same number of pencils. The question is asking for the greatest number of pencils he could have left over. Hmm, let me think.

First, I need to figure out what's being asked here. The problem is about dividing pencils into three bags with equal numbers in each, and we need the maximum remainder possible. So, it's like a division problem where the remainder is what's left over after dividing the total number of pencils by 3. The remainder can't be more than 2 because if there were 3 or more, you could put another set into the bags. So, the maximum remainder here would be 2.
Wait, but maybe I need to consider the total number of pencils. The problem says "a bunch" which is vague, so maybe we need to find the maximum possible remainder regardless of the total number. But since the number of bags is three, the remainder when dividing by 3 can be 0, 1, or 2. So the greatest remainder possible is 2. Therefore, the answer is 2.

But let me make sure I'm not missing something. Let me break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of pencils as N. Zach wants to divide N pencils into 3 bags with the same number in each. So, he's looking to do N divided by 3.

<prompt_1.1> Use the above plan to express the problem mathematically and determine the remainder. </prompt_1.1>

Wait, but maybe the problem is trickier? Let me check again.

The problem says "the greatest number of pencils he could have left over". So, if he has N pencils, the remainder when divided by 3 is N mod 3. The maximum possible remainder is 2.
So regardless of how many pencils there are, the maximum remainder is 2. Therefore, the answer is 2. So, the final answer is 2, which in the box is \boxed{2}.

But let me think if there's another way. Suppose the problem was about distributing pencils into three bags with different numbers, but the question is about the maximum equal number, so the remainder is key.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is about the maximum number of pencils he could have left over, given that he's placing the greatest number possible into each bag. So, if he has N pencils, he puts as many as possible into each bag, which would be floor(N/3), and the remainder is N mod 3. So, the remainder is the leftover. So, the maximum possible remainder is 2.

<prompt_1.2> Confirm the final answer using the above plan. </prompt_1.2>

But wait, maybe the problem is presented in a way that the number of pencils is not given, so we need to express the remainder in terms of the total number. But the question says "the greatest number of pencils he could have left over".

Let's denote the total number of pencils as N. Zach wants to divide N pencils into 3 bags with the same number in each. So, he's looking to do N divided by 3. The quotient would be the number of pencils per bag, and the remainder would be the leftover pencils. Since we want the greatest number of pencils left over, we need the maximum possible remainder when dividing by 3.

But wait, the remainder when dividing by 3 can be 0, 1, or 2. So, the maximum remainder is 2. Therefore, the answer is 2.

<execution_1.2>
Therefore, the answer is 2. So, the final answer is 2. So, the answer should be 2, boxed as \boxed{2}.

But wait, let me check with an example. Suppose he has 7 pencils. 7 divided by 3 is 2 with a remainder of 1. So, he puts 2 pencils in each bag, totaling 6, and has 1 left over. If he has 8 pencils, 8 divided by 3 is 2 with a remainder of 2. So, he puts 2 in each bag (6 total), and has 2 left over. If he has 9 pencils, remainder is 0. So, the maximum remainder is 2. Therefore, regardless of the total number of pencils, the maximum remainder possible when dividing by 3 is 2. Therefore, the answer is 2.
