Okay, so I need to solve the equation |x + 5| - |3x - 6| = 0 and find the largest possible value of x. Hmm, absolute value equations can sometimes be tricky because they involve multiple cases. Let me start by understanding what this equation is saying. The equation is saying that the absolute value of (x + 5) is equal to the absolute value of (3x - 6). So, |x + 5| = |3x - 6|. That means either the expressions inside the absolute values are equal or they are negatives of each other. 

Right, so when dealing with absolute value equations, if |A| = |B|, then either A = B or A = -B. So, I can split this into two separate equations to solve:

1. x + 5 = 3x - 6
2. x + 5 = -(3x - 6)

Let me solve each case separately and then check for any extraneous solutions.

Starting with the first equation: x + 5 = 3x - 6.

<prompt_1.1> Solve the first equation x + 5 = 3x - 6 and find the value of x. </prompt_1.1>

Now, moving on to the second equation: x + 5 = -(3x - 6). Let me simplify the right side first.

<prompt_1.2> Solve the second equation x + 5 = -(3x - 6) and find the value of x. </prompt_1.2>

Let me subtract x from both sides to get:

5 = 2x - 6

Then, add 6 to both sides:

11 = 2x

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 11/2

So that's 5.5. But I need to check if this solution is valid by plugging it back into the original equation to make sure it works. Let's do that.
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
The negative of (3x - 6) is -3x + 6. So, the equation becomes:

x + 5 = -3x + 6

Now, let's solve for x. Bring all the x terms to one side and constants to the other:

x + 3x = 6 - 5

4x = 1

So, x = 1/4.

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1, execution_1.2:
Now, we have two solutions: x = 11/2 and x = 1/4. The problem asks for the largest possible value of x, so between 11/2 (which is 5.5) and 1/4 (0.25), the largest is 11/2. Therefore, the answer should be 11/2. But again, I need to check this solution in the original equation to ensure it's valid.

Original equation: |x + 5| - |3x - 6| = 0.

<prompt_2.1> Verify the solution x = 11/2 by checking it against the original equation |x + 5| - |3x - 6| = 0. </prompt_2.1>

But wait, let me think again. Absolute value equations can sometimes have more solutions or extraneous ones, but in this case, we considered both cases where the absolute values are equal, so these should be the only solutions.

However, another way to approach absolute value equations is to consider the critical points where the expressions inside the absolute values change sign. For |x + 5|, the critical point is at x + 5 = 0 => x = -5. For |3x - 6|, the critical point is at 3x - 6 = 0 => x = 2. So, the critical points are x = -5 and x = 2. Therefore, we can divide the real line into intervals based on these critical points: (-∞, -5), [-5, 2), and [2, ∞). Then, in each interval, we can remove the absolute value signs accordingly and solve the equation.

Let me try this method to confirm.

<prompt_2.2> Divide the real line into intervals based on the critical points and solve the equation in each interval. </prompt_2.2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Let's check x = 11/2.

First, compute x + 5: 11/2 + 5 = 11/2 + 10/2 = 21/2. So, |21/2| = 21/2.

Next, compute 3x - 6: 3*(11/2) - 6 = 33/2 - 12/2 = 21/2. So, |21/2| = 21/2.

Therefore, |x + 5| - |3x - 6| = 21/2 - 21/2 = 0. That works.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
First interval: x < -5

In this interval, x + 5 is negative (since x < -5), so |x + 5| = -(x + 5) = -x -5.

Similarly, 3x -6: if x < -5, then 3x < -15, so 3x -6 < -21, which is negative. Therefore, |3x -6| = -(3x -6) = -3x +6.

So, the equation |x +5| = |3x -6| becomes:

-x -5 = -3x +6

Solving:

Add 3x to both sides: 2x -5 = 6

Add 5: 2x = 11

x = 11/2

But wait, 11/2 is 5.5, which is not in the interval x < -5. Therefore, there is no solution in this interval.

Second interval: -5 ≤ x < 2

In this interval, x +5 is non-negative (since x ≥ -5), so |x +5| = x +5.

3x -6: since x <2, 3x <6, so 3x -6 <0. Therefore, |3x -6| = -3x +6.

Equation becomes:

x +5 = -3x +6

Solving:

x +3x = 6 -5

4x =1

x=1/4

Now, check if x=1/4 is in the interval [-5,2). 1/4 is 0.25, which is between -5 and 2. So, valid solution.

Third interval: x ≥2

In this interval, x +5 is positive (since x ≥2, so x +5 ≥7), so |x +5| =x +5.

3x -6: since x ≥2, 3x ≥6, so 3x -6 ≥0. Therefore, |3x -6| =3x -6.

Equation becomes:

x +5 =3x -6

Solving:

5 +6 =3x -x

11=2x

x=11/2=5.5

Check if x=5.5 is in the interval [2, ∞). Yes, 5.5 is greater than 2. So, valid solution.

Therefore, the solutions are x=1/4 and x=11/2, same as before. Therefore, the largest possible value is 11/2.

Wait, but let me check if there's any other possible solutions. For example, when we split into intervals, we considered all critical points, so I think that's thorough. So, the solutions are definitely 1/4 and 11/2, and 11/2 is the larger one.

But just to be thorough, let me check both solutions in the original equation.

First, x=1/4:

|1/4 +5| - |3*(1/4) -6| = |5.25| - |0.75 -6| =5.25 - | -5.25 | =5.25 -5.25=0. So, that works.

Second, x=11/2=5.5:

|5.5 +5| - |3*5.5 -6| = |10.5| - |16.5 -6| =10.5 - |10.5| =10.5 -10.5=0. That also works.

Therefore, both solutions are valid, and the largest is 11/2.

But wait, just to make sure there isn't any other solution. Let me think. Absolute value equations can sometimes have more solutions if there are multiple cases, but in this problem, we considered all possible cases by splitting into intervals. So, I think that's all. Therefore, the answer is 11/2.

Based on execution_2.2:
But let me just check once more if maybe in the second interval, when we had x=1/4, but is there a possibility that when we split into cases, maybe we missed something? For example, sometimes when you have equations with multiple absolute values, there can be overlapping cases or something else. But in this problem, since we have two absolute values, each with their own critical points, splitting into three intervals based on those critical points is the standard approach, and that's exactly what we did. So, I think that's solid.

Alternatively, another way to approach |A| = |B| is to square both sides, since squaring preserves the absolute value. So, |A| = |B| implies A² = B². Let's try that method as another check.

<prompt_3.1> Use the squaring method to solve the equation |x + 5| = |3x - 6| and verify the solutions. </prompt_3.1>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
So, (x +5)² = (3x -6)²

Expanding both sides:

Left: x² +10x +25

Right: (3x)^2 -2*3x*6 +6^2 =9x² -36x +36

Set them equal:

x² +10x +25 =9x² -36x +36

Bring all terms to left side:

x² +10x +25 -9x² +36x -36=0

Combine like terms:

(1 -9)x² + (10x +36x) + (25 -36)=0

-8x² +46x -11=0

Multiply both sides by -1:

8x² -46x +11=0

Now, solve quadratic equation 8x² -46x +11=0.

Using quadratic formula: x = [46 ± sqrt( (-46)^2 -4*8*11 )]/(2*8)

Compute discriminant:

D=46² -4*8*11=2116 -352=1764

sqrt(1764)=42

Therefore, x=(46 ±42)/16

Compute both solutions:

First solution: (46 +42)/16=88/16=11/2=5.5

Second solution: (46 -42)/16=4/16=1/4=0.25

So, same solutions as before. Therefore, this confirms that the solutions are x=11/2 and x=1/4. Thus, the largest possible value is 11/2. 

Therefore, regardless of the method used—whether splitting into cases based on critical points, solving algebraically by considering the two cases for |A|=|B|, or squaring both sides—the solutions are consistent. Hence, the largest value of x is 11/2.
