<Plan_1>
Okay, let's try to figure out this problem where we need to find the smallest possible value of |m - n| given that 3m + 4n = 100, and m and n are integers. Hmm, alright. Let's start by understanding what's being asked here.

First, we have a linear equation with two variables, m and n. Both are integers, which is important. The equation is 3m + 4n = 100. We need to find integer solutions (m, n) to this equation such that the absolute difference between m and n, which is |m - n|, is as small as possible. Our goal is to minimize |m - n|.

So, how do we approach this? Well, maybe I can express one variable in terms of the other and then look for integer solutions. Let's try solving the equation for one variable. Let's say we solve for m in terms of n. So, from 3m + 4n = 100, subtract 4n from both sides: 3m = 100 - 4n. Then divide both sides by 3: m = (100 - 4n)/3.

<prompt_1.1> Solve the equation 3m + 4n = 100 for m in terms of n and determine the condition for m to be an integer. </prompt_1.1>

Alternatively, maybe I can parameterize all solutions to the equation 3m + 4n = 100. Since 3 and 4 are coprime, the general solution can be found using the extended Euclidean algorithm. Let me recall how that works.

<prompt_1.2> Use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the general solution for all integer solutions of 3m + 4n = 100. </prompt_1.2>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
Since m has to be an integer, (100 - 4n) must be divisible by 3. That means 100 - 4n ≡ 0 mod 3. Let's compute 100 mod 3 first. 3*33=99, so 100 - 99 =1, so 100 ≡1 mod 3. Similarly, 4n mod 3 is equivalent to (4 mod 3)*n =1*n mod 3. So, the equation 100 -4n ≡0 mod 3 becomes 1 - n ≡0 mod 3, which simplifies to -n ≡ -1 mod 3, or n ≡1 mod 3. Therefore, n must be congruent to 1 modulo 3. So n can be written as 3k +1 for some integer k.

<execution_1.2>
The equation 3m + 4n = 100 is a linear Diophantine equation. The general solution can be expressed once we find a particular solution. Let's first find one particular solution. Let me think. Trying small values: if m=0, then 4n=100, so n=25. So (m, n) = (0, 25) is a solution. Wait, but 3*0 + 4*25 = 100, yes. So that's a particular solution.

Then, the general solution will be given by:

m = m0 + (4)t

n = n0 - (3)t

where t is an integer, since 3 and 4 are coefficients. Wait, the standard form for linear Diophantine equations is ax + by = c. The general solution when x0, y0 is a particular solution is x = x0 + (b/d)t, y = y0 - (a/d)t, where d is the gcd of a and b. Here, gcd(3,4)=1, so the general solution is m = 0 + 4t, n = 25 - 3t, where t is an integer. Wait, but let me check that. If t=0, then m=0, n=25. If t=1, m=4, n=25 -3=22. Let's check if that satisfies the equation: 3*4 +4*22=12 +88=100. Yes. Similarly, t=-1: m=-4, n=25 +3=28. 3*(-4) +4*28= -12 +112=100. Correct. So the general solution is m=4t, n=25 -3t for all integers t.

Based on execution_1.1:
Therefore, substituting back into the equation for m: m = (100 -4n)/3 = (100 -4*(3k +1))/3 = (100 -12k -4)/3 = (96 -12k)/3 = 32 -4k. So m =32 -4k and n=3k +1. So all integer solutions are given by m=32 -4k and n=3k +1 for some integer k.

Now, we need to find the value of k such that |m -n| is minimized. Let's compute |m -n| in terms of k. m -n = (32 -4k) - (3k +1) =32 -4k -3k -1 =31 -7k. Therefore, |m -n| = |31 -7k|. So we need to find integer k such that |31 -7k| is minimized.

To minimize |31 -7k|, we can think of this as finding an integer k that makes 7k as close as possible to 31. So 7k ≈31. Therefore, k≈31/7≈4.42857. Since k must be an integer, the closest integers to 4.42857 are 4 and 5.

Let's check both k=4 and k=5.

<prompt_2.1> Calculate |m - n| for k = 4 and k = 5 and determine which gives the smaller value. </prompt_2.1>

Based on execution_1.2:
Therefore, instead of expressing n in terms of m or vice versa, we can express both m and n in terms of a parameter t. Then, compute |m -n| = |4t - (25 -3t)| = |4t -25 +3t| = |7t -25|. Wait, hold on. Wait, m=4t, n=25 -3t. Therefore, m -n =4t - (25 -3t)=4t -25 +3t=7t -25. Therefore, |m -n|=|7t -25|. So we need to minimize |7t -25| over integers t.

<prompt_2.2> Use the general solution from the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the minimum value of |m - n|. </prompt_2.2>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
For k=4: |31 -7*4| = |31 -28| = |3| =3.

For k=5: |31 -7*5| = |31 -35| = |-4| =4. So k=4 gives a smaller value of 3, while k=5 gives 4. Therefore, k=4 is better.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
So this is equivalent to finding an integer t such that 7t is as close as possible to 25. So 7t ≈25. Therefore, t≈25/7≈3.5714. So the nearest integers are t=3 and t=4.

Let's check t=3: |7*3 -25|=|21 -25|=4.

t=4: |7*4 -25|=|28 -25|=3.

Wait, that's better. So t=4 gives |28 -25|=3, which is smaller than 4. Let's check t=5: |35 -25|=10, which is larger. So the minimum occurs at t=4 with |m -n|=3.

Wait, but let me check t=3 and t=4. For t=3: m=4*3=12, n=25 -3*3=25 -9=16. Then |12 -16|=4. For t=4: m=16, n=25 -12=13. |16 -13|=3. So yes, 3 is smaller. Is there a smaller value?

Wait, let's check t=2: |14 -25|=11, which is bigger. t=1: |7 -25|=18. t=0: |0 -25|=25. Negative t: t=-1: |-7 -25|=32. So indeed, the minimum occurs at t=4 with |m -n|=3. So is 3 the minimal possible value?

Based on execution_2.1:
Wait, but let me verify this. Let's check the solutions for k=4 and k=5.

<prompt_3.1> Verify the solutions for k = 4 and k = 5 to ensure they satisfy the equation 3m + 4n = 100. </prompt_3.1>

Based on execution_2.2:
But let's confirm this with the original equation. For t=4, m=16, n=13. Let's check 3*16 +4*13=48 +52=100. Correct.

<prompt_3.2> Confirm the solution for t = 4 using the original equation and check for t = 3 and t = 5. </prompt_3.2>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
For k=4: m=32 -4*4=32 -16=16; n=3*4 +1=12 +1=13. Then 3*16 +4*13=48 +52=100. Correct. |16 -13|=3.

For k=5: m=32 -4*5=32 -20=12; n=3*5 +1=15 +1=16. Then 3*12 +4*16=36 +64=100. Correct. |12 -16|=4.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
So that's a valid solution. The difference |16 -13|=3.

For t=3, m=12, n=16. 3*12 +4*16=36 +64=100. Correct. |12 -16|=4.

But wait, is there a possibility of a smaller value? Let's check if there's another t that gives |7t -25| less than 3. The next possible value would be 2 or 1. Let's see if 7t -25=±1 or ±2.

Solving 7t -25=1: 7t=26 ⇒ t=26/7≈3.714, not integer.

7t -25=-1:7t=24 ⇒t=24/7≈3.428, not integer.

7t -25=2:7t=27⇒t=27/7≈3.857, not integer.

7t -25=-2:7t=23⇒t=23/7≈3.285, not integer.

Similarly, for 0: 7t=25⇒t=25/7≈3.571, not integer. So there's no integer t that makes 7t -25=0, which makes sense because 25 isn't a multiple of 7. Therefore, the closest integers are t=3 and t=4, giving differences of 4 and 3, respectively. Therefore, 3 is the minimal possible value.

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.2:
But just to be thorough, let's check if there are any other possible solutions where |m -n| could be smaller. Let's see.

<prompt_4.1> Perform a final verification to ensure no smaller value of |m - n| exists. </prompt_4.1>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
Suppose there exists another solution where |m -n| is 2 or 1. Let's assume that |m -n|=1. Then m -n=±1. Let's set up the equations:

Case 1: m -n=1. Then m =n +1. Substitute into 3m +4n=100: 3(n +1) +4n=100 ⇒3n +3 +4n=100 ⇒7n +3=100 ⇒7n=97 ⇒n=97/7≈13.857. Not integer.

Case 2: m -n=-1 ⇒m =n -1. Substitute into equation: 3(n -1) +4n=100 ⇒3n -3 +4n=100 ⇒7n -3=100 ⇒7n=103 ⇒n=103/7≈14.714. Not integer.

Similarly, for |m -n|=2:

Case 1: m -n=2 ⇒m =n +2. Substitute: 3(n +2) +4n=100 ⇒3n +6 +4n=100 ⇒7n +6=100 ⇒7n=94 ⇒n=94/7≈13.428. Not integer.

Case 2: m -n=-2 ⇒m =n -2. Substitute: 3(n -2) +4n=100 ⇒3n -6 +4n=100 ⇒7n -6=100 ⇒7n=106 ⇒n=106/7≈15.142. Not integer.

Therefore, there are no integer solutions where |m -n| is 1 or 2. Hence, the minimal possible value is indeed 3.

But just to recap and ensure I haven't missed anything, let's go through the steps again.

<prompt_5.1> Recap and ensure no steps were missed and confirm the minimal value of |m - n|. </prompt_5.1>
</Plan_5>

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
1. Start with equation 3m +4n=100. Solve for m in terms of n: m=(100 -4n)/3. For m to be integer, 100 -4n must be divisible by 3. 100≡1 mod3, 4n≡1n mod3. So 1 -n≡0 mod3 ⇒n≡1 mod3. So n=3k +1. Then m=32 -4k. Then m -n=31 -7k. So |31 -7k| is to be minimized. 7k ≈31 ⇒k≈4.428. So k=4 gives |31 -28|=3, which is minimal.

2. Alternatively, using the general solution of the Diophantine equation: m=4t, n=25 -3t. Then m -n=7t -25. |7t -25| to be minimized. 7t≈25 ⇒t≈3.571. So t=4 gives |28 -25|=3, which is minimal.

3. Checked all possible t near 3.571 (t=3,4) and found that |m -n|=3 is the smallest possible. Also verified that smaller differences (1 or 2) are impossible because they would require non-integer solutions.

Therefore, the smallest possible value of |m -n| is 3.
