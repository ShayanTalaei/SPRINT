Okay, let's see. I need to simplify the square root of 242. Hmm, how do I do that again? I remember from math class that simplifying a square root involves factoring the number into perfect squares. But wait, what's a perfect square? Oh right, numbers like 4, 9, 16, 25, etc. , because their square roots are whole numbers.

So, the goal is to break down 242 into factors where at least one is a perfect square. Then, I can take the square root of that perfect square out of the radical. Let me start by prime factorizing 242. Let me think. 242 divided by 2 is 121. Oh, right, because 2 times 121 is 242.

Then 121 is 11 times 11. So, 242 is 2 multiplied by 11 squared. Wait, 11 squared is 121, so 2 times 11 squared equals 242.

So, if I write the square root of 242 as the square root of (2 * 11^2). Then, using the property that the square root of a product is the product of the square roots, this would be the same as the square root of 11^2 multiplied by the square root of 2. The square root of 11 squared is just 11, so that comes out of the radical. Then, we have 11 times the square root of 2.

So, simplified, sqrt(242) is 11*sqrt(2). Let me check if that's correct. Let me compute 11 squared times 2.

Based on execution_1.1:
11 squared is 121, 121 times 2 is 242. Yep, that's right. So, the simplified form should be 11âˆš2.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any larger perfect squares.

Is there any other way to factor 242? Let me try dividing by other primes.

Maybe I should check if there's a larger perfect square factor than 121. Let's see, 242 divided by 4 is 60.5, which isn't an integer, so 4 isn't a factor. 242 divided by 9 is about 26.888, not an integer. 25? 242 divided by 25 is 9.68, nope. So the next possible perfect square after 121 would be 16, but 242 divided by 16 is 15.125, which is still not an integer. So, 121 is the largest perfect square factor here.

After 2, the next prime is 3. 242 divided by 3 is roughly 80.666...., which isn't a whole number. Then 5? 242 divided by 5 is 48.4, nope. 7? 242 divided by 7 is about 34.571... , not whole. 11 we already did. So, the prime factors are indeed 2 and 11, 11. So, no other factors to consider.
