</Question>

<think>
<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to simplify the expression tan 100° + 4 sin 100°. Hmm, let's start by recalling some trigonometric identities and see if I can manipulate this expression into a more straightforward form.

First, tan 100° is the same as sin 100° / cos 100°. So maybe I can rewrite the entire expression in terms of sine and cosine. Let me try that:

<prompt_1.1> Rewrite the expression tan 100° + 4 sin 100° in terms of sine and cosine. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
tan 100° + 4 sin 100° = (sin 100° / cos 100°) + 4 sin 100°

Hmm, maybe I can factor out sin 100° from both terms? Let's see:

= sin 100° (1 / cos 100° + 4)
</execution_1.1>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
But 1 / cos 100° is sec 100°, so this becomes sin 100° (sec 100° + 4). Not sure if that helps. Let me think of another approach.
Alternatively, maybe express everything in terms of sine and cosine and find a common denominator.

Let me try that.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to combine the terms using angle addition formulas? Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps express tan 100° + 4 sin 100° as R sin(100° + α) or something like that? Wait, but that might not directly work because one term is tan and the other is sin. Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe express tan 100° as sin 100° / cos 100°, and then write the entire expression as (sin 100° + 4 sin 100° cos 100°) / cos 100°, which is similar to what I did before.

<prompt_2.2> Explore alternative approaches to simplify the expression. </prompt_2.2>
-----

Alternatively, maybe there's a clever use of co-function identities? For example, since 100° is complementary to 80°, but tan(100°) = tan(90° +10°) = -cot 10°, but that might complicate things.

<prompt_2.3> Explore the use of co-function and other identities to simplify the expression. </prompt_2.3>

Alternatively, if I use the identity sin A + sin B = 2 sin( (A+B)/2 ) cos( (A-B)/2 ). But here, we have sin 100° + 2 sin 200°, which is sin 100° + 2 sin 200°. Let's see:

<prompt_2.4> Apply the sum-to-product identities to the expression. </prompt_2.4>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Starting with tan 100° + 4 sin 100° = (sin 100° / cos 100°) + 4 sin 100°

To combine these terms, I need a common denominator. The first term already has cos 100° in the denominator, so let's multiply the second term by cos 100° / cos 100° to get:

= (sin 100° + 4 sin 100° cos 100°) / cos 100°
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Wait, let's try that:

tan 100° + 4 sin 100° = (sin 100° / cos 100°) + 4 sin 100° = [sin 100° + 4 sin 100° cos 100°] / cos 100°
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
Wait, tan(100°) = tan(90° +10°) = -cot 10°, right? Because tan(90° + x) = -cot x. So maybe:

tan 100° + 4 sin 100° = -cot 10° + 4 sin 100°

But cot 10° is cos 10° / sin 10°, so this becomes:

- cos 10° / sin 10° + 4 sin 100°

But sin 100° is sin(90° +10°) = cos 10°, so sin 100° = cos 10°. Therefore:

- cos 10° / sin 10° + 4 cos 10° = cos 10° ( -1 / sin 10° + 4 )

= cos 10° ( 4 - 1 / sin 10° )

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful.
</execution_2.3>

<execution_2.4>
Using the identity sin A + sin B = 2 sin( (A+B)/2 ) cos( (A-B)/2 ). But here, we have sin 100° + 2 sin 200°. Let me factor out the 2 first:

= 2 [ (1/2) sin 100° + sin 200° ]

But maybe a better approach is to use the identity for a sum of sine and multiple sine. Alternatively, use the formula for A sin x + B cos x = C sin(x + φ). Wait, but here it's sin 100° + 2 sin 200°. Let me compute the numerical values to see if there's a pattern.

But maybe instead, use the identity for sum of sines. Let me recall that sin A + sin B = 2 sin( (A+B)/2 ) cos( (A-B)/2 ). However, here we have sin 100° + 2 sin 200°. Let me write 2 sin 200° as sin 200° + sin 200°, so then we have sin 100° + sin 200° + sin 200°. Then group sin 100° + sin 200° first:

sin 100° + sin 200° = 2 sin( (100° + 200°)/2 ) cos( (100° - 200°)/2 ) = 2 sin 150° cos(-50°)

But cos(-50°) = cos 50°, so this becomes 2 sin 150° cos 50°. Since sin 150° = 1/2, so 2 * 1/2 * cos 50° = cos 50°. Therefore, sin 100° + sin 200° = cos 50°. Then the original expression is cos 50° + sin 200°. But sin 200° is sin(180° + 20°) = -sin 20°, so this becomes cos 50° - sin 20°. Hmm, is this helpful?

Alternatively, maybe another approach. Let's think about the original expression: tan 100° + 4 sin 100°. Let me consider converting everything to sine and cosine:

tan 100° + 4 sin 100° = (sin 100° / cos 100°) + 4 sin 100° = sin 100° (1 / cos 100° + 4) = sin 100° (sec 100° + 4)

But perhaps we can write this as sin 100° * (sec 100° + 4) = sin 100° sec 100° + 4 sin 100° = 1 + 4 sin 100°, which brings us back to the original expression. So that's not helpful.

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Hmm, maybe I can use the identity for sin A cos B. Let's recall that sin A cos B = [sin(A + B) + sin(A - B)] / 2. So if I let A = 100° and B = 100°, then sin 100° cos 100° = [sin(200°) + sin(0°)] / 2 = sin 200° / 2.

So substituting back into the expression:

= (sin 100° + 4 * (sin 200° / 2)) / cos 100°
= (sin 100° + 2 sin 200°) / cos 100°

Now, sin 200° is sin(180° + 20°) = -sin 20°, so sin 200° = -sin 20°. Therefore:

= (sin 100° - 2 sin 20°) / cos 100°

Based on execution_2.4:
Alternatively, maybe use product-to-sum identities on 4 sin 100°. Wait, but 4 sin 100° is just 4 sin 100°, unless we can express it as a product. Alternatively, perhaps use the identity for multiple angles.

Alternatively, let's consider calculating the numerical value of the original expression and see if it corresponds to a known angle's sine or cosine. Maybe that can give a hint.

<prompt_3.2> Calculate the numerical value of the expression to identify a known angle. </prompt_3.2>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
sin 100° (1 / cos 100° + 4) = sin 100° (sec 100° + 4)

But 1 / cos 100° is sec 100°, which is equal to sec(80°), since 100° = 90° + 10°, but maybe not. Wait, 100° is in the second quadrant where sec is negative. Hmm, but perhaps there's a better identity here.

Alternatively, maybe express sec 100° + 4 in terms of another angle. Let me recall that sec(90° + x) = -csc x. Since 100° = 90° + 10°, so sec 100° = sec(90° + 10°) = -csc 10°. Therefore, sec 100° = -csc 10°, so:

sec 100° + 4 = -csc 10° + 4 = 4 - csc 10°
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
Let me compute tan 100° + 4 sin 100° numerically.

First, convert 100° to radians: 100° * π/180 ≈ 1.745 radians.

Compute tan(100°): tan(100°) ≈ tan(1.745) ≈ -5.671 (since 100° is in the second quadrant where tangent is negative).

Compute sin(100°): sin(100°) ≈ 0.9848.

Therefore, tan 100° + 4 sin 100° ≈ -5.671 + 4 * 0.9848 ≈ -5.671 + 3.939 ≈ -1.732.

Hmm, -1.732 is approximately -√3, since √3 ≈ 1.732. So maybe the simplified expression is -√3?

</Execution_3>

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.2:
Let me check if this is possible.

If the simplified expression is -√3, then perhaps there's a way to show that tan 100° + 4 sin 100° = -√3.

Alternatively, maybe the exact value is -2√3, but my approximation suggests -√3. Let me check with more accurate calculations.

<prompt_4.1> Verify the numerical approximation and explore further simplification. </prompt_4.1>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
Let me use a calculator for higher precision.

Compute tan(100°):

100° in radians is 5π/9 ≈ 1.7453292519943295 radians.

tan(100°) = tan(π - 80°) = -tan(80°). tan(80°) ≈ 5.671281820710109, so tan(100°) ≈ -5.671281820710109.

sin(100°) = sin(π - 80°) = sin(80°) ≈ 0.984807753012208.

Therefore, 4 sin(100°) ≈ 4 * 0.984807753012208 ≈ 3.939231012048832.

Therefore, tan 100° + 4 sin 100° ≈ -5.671281820710109 + 3.939231012048832 ≈ -1.732050808661277.

And -√3 ≈ -1.7320508075688772. So the result is very close to -√3. Therefore, it's likely that the simplified form is -√3.

But how to show this algebraically?

So, perhaps we need to find an identity or a method that leads to this result. Let's go back to the expression:

tan 100° + 4 sin 100° = -√3

Let me square both sides to see if that helps, but I need to be careful since squaring can introduce extraneous solutions. However, since we already have numerical evidence, maybe it's a valid identity.

But perhaps there's a way to express tan 100° + 4 sin 100° as -√3 using trigonometric identities.

Alternatively, consider that 100° is related to 30°, 60°, etc. Maybe there's a way to write this expression in terms of known angles.

Alternatively, use the identity for tan(3θ) or something similar. Let me think.

Alternatively, consider that 100° = 60° + 40°, but I don't know if that helps. Alternatively, 100° = 30° + 70°, but not sure.

Alternatively, let's use the identity for tan(A) + sin(A). Wait, but here we have tan(100°) + 4 sin(100°). Let's see:

tan θ + 4 sin θ. Let me set θ = 100°, so the expression is tan θ + 4 sin θ. Let's try to write this as R sin(θ + α) or something similar.

Alternatively, express tan θ as sin θ / cos θ, so:

tan θ + 4 sin θ = (sin θ / cos θ) + 4 sin θ = sin θ (1 / cos θ + 4) = sin θ (sec θ + 4)

But earlier, we saw that sec 100° = -csc 10°, so:

= sin 100° (-csc 10° + 4) = sin 100° (4 - csc 10°)

But sin 100° = cos 10°, so:

= cos 10° (4 - csc 10°) = cos 10° (4 - 1 / sin 10°)

Hmm, maybe compute this expression:

4 cos 10° - cos 10° / sin 10°

But 4 cos 10° - (cos 10° / sin 10°) = 4 cos 10° - cot 10°

But cot 10° = cos 10° / sin 10°, so this is 4 cos 10° - cot 10°. Not sure if that helps. Let's see if this equals -√3.

But maybe instead of going this way, let's think of another approach. Let's suppose that tan 100° + 4 sin 100° = -√3. Let's verify this by another method.

Alternatively, consider the expression tan θ + 4 sin θ. Let's set this equal to -√3 and solve for θ. But since θ is given as 100°, maybe this is a specific case. Alternatively, use the method of auxiliary angles.

<Plan_5>
Based on execution_4.1:
Let me recall that an expression of the form a sin θ + b cos θ can be written as R sin(θ + φ), where R = √(a² + b²) and φ = arctan(b/a) or something similar.

<prompt_5.1> Use the auxiliary angle method to simplify the expression. </prompt_5.1>
</Plan_5>

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
But here, the expression is tan θ + 4 sin θ. Let's write tan θ as sin θ / cos θ, so:

tan θ + 4 sin θ = sin θ / cos θ + 4 sin θ = sin θ (1 / cos θ + 4) = sin θ (sec θ + 4)

But this is not in the form a sin θ + b cos θ, so the auxiliary angle method may not apply directly. Alternatively, perhaps express everything in terms of sine and cosine with a common angle.

Alternatively, use the identity for tan θ + k sin θ. Let me try to write this as a single trigonometric function. Let's set:

tan θ + 4 sin θ = -√3

We can check if this is true for θ = 100°. Let me compute the left-hand side:

tan 100° + 4 sin 100° ≈ -5.6713 + 4 * 0.9848 ≈ -5.6713 + 3.9392 ≈ -1.7321

And -√3 ≈ -1.73205, which is very close. Therefore, it's highly likely that tan 100° + 4 sin 100° = -√3. Therefore, the simplified form is -√3.

But to prove this algebraically, let's consider:

Let’s denote θ = 100°, then we need to show that tan θ + 4 sin θ = -√3.

Let’s write tan θ + 4 sin θ = (sin θ / cos θ) + 4 sin θ = sin θ (1 / cos θ + 4)

= sin θ (sec θ + 4)

We can write this as:

sin θ * sec θ + 4 sin θ = 1 + 4 sin θ

Wait, that's not correct. Wait, sin θ * sec θ is (sin θ / cos θ) * cos θ = sin θ. Wait, no:

Wait, sin θ (sec θ + 4) = sin θ * sec θ + sin θ * 4 = (sin θ / cos θ) + 4 sin θ = tan θ + 4 sin θ. So that's circular. So that approach doesn't help.

Alternatively, let's consider expressing this in terms of a single trigonometric function. Let's divide both sides by cos θ:

tan θ + 4 sin θ = (sin θ / cos θ) + 4 sin θ = sin θ (1 / cos θ + 4)

Suppose we set this equal to -√3:

sin θ (1 / cos θ + 4) = -√3

But θ = 100°, so plugging in:

sin 100° (sec 100° + 4) = -√3

From earlier, we have:

sec 100° = -csc 10°, so:

sin 100° (-csc 10° + 4) = -√3

But sin 100° = cos 10°, so:

cos 10° (-csc 10° + 4) = -√3

Compute:

- cos 10° / sin 10° + 4 cos 10° = -√3

Which is:

- cot 10° + 4 cos 10° = -√3

So, if we can show that -cot 10° + 4 cos 10° = -√3, then it's proven.

But let's compute this numerically:

cot 10° = cos 10° / sin 10° ≈ 0.9848 / 0.1736 ≈ 5.6713

4 cos 10° ≈ 4 * 0.9848 ≈ 3.9392

Therefore, -5.6713 + 3.9392 ≈ -1.7321, which is approximately -√3. Therefore, this equality holds numerically, which suggests that it's an identity. Therefore, we can conclude that tan 100° + 4 sin 100° simplifies to -√3.

But to make this more rigorous, perhaps use exact trigonometric identities. Let me consider that 100° is 60° + 40°, but not sure. Alternatively, use the fact that 10° is related to 30°, but perhaps not. Alternatively, use the identity for sin(3θ):

sin(3θ) = 3 sin θ - 4 sin³ θ

But θ = 10°, so sin(30°) = 3 sin 10° - 4 sin³ 10°. Since sin(30°) = 1/2, so:

1/2 = 3 sin 10° - 4 sin³ 10°

Let me denote x = sin 10°, then:

4x³ - 3x + 1/2 = 0

But not sure if this helps. Alternatively, perhaps consider that if -cot 10° + 4 cos 10° = -√3, then:

4 cos 10° - cot 10° = √3

Let me square both sides:

(4 cos 10° - cot 10°)² = 3

Compute left-hand side:

= 16 cos² 10° - 8 cos 10° cot 10° + cot² 10°

= 16 cos² 10° - 8 cos 10° (cos 10° / sin 10°) + (cos² 10° / sin² 10°)

= 16 cos² 10° - 8 cos² 10° / sin 10° + cos² 10° / sin² 10°

This seems complicated, but let's compute numerically:

cos 10° ≈ 0.9848, sin 10° ≈ 0.1736

16 cos² 10° ≈ 16 * 0.9698 ≈ 15.5168

8 cos² 10° / sin 10° ≈ 8 * 0.9698 / 0.1736 ≈ 8 * 5.590 ≈ 44.72

cos² 10° / sin² 10° ≈ 0.9698 / 0.0301 ≈ 32.22

So total:

15.5168 - 44.72 + 32.22 ≈ 15.5168 - 44.72 = -29.2032 + 32.22 ≈ 3.0168 ≈ 3.0168, which is approximately 3. So, squaring both sides gives approximately 3, which matches the right-hand side. Therefore, the original equation holds, which suggests that 4 cos 10° - cot 10° = √3, hence tan 100° + 4 sin 100° = -√3.

Therefore, after going through this lengthy thought process and verifying numerically, it seems that the simplified form of tan 100° + 4 sin 100° is indeed -√3.
