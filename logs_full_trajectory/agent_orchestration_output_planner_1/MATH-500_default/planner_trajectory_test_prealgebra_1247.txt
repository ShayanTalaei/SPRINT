Okay, let's see. There's a problem here about a class of 50 students. 28 are in MATHCOUNTS, 21 in science club, and 6 don't participate in either. We need to find how many are in both clubs. Hmm, okay, so this sounds like a classic inclusion-exclusion principle problem. Let me recall how that works.

First, the total number of students is 50. But 6 of them aren't in either club. So that means 50 - 6 = 44 students are in at least one of the two clubs. Right? So the number of students in MATHCOUNTS or science club (or both) is 44.

Now, the formula for the inclusion-exclusion principle for two sets is: |A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|. Where |A ∪ B| is the number of students in either MATHCOUNTS or science club, |A| is MATHCOUNTS, |B| is science club, and |A ∩ B| is those in both.

We know |A ∪ B| is 44, |A| is 28, |B| is 21. So plugging into the formula: 44 = 28 + 21 - |A ∩ B|.

Let me check that again.
So, 28 plus 21 is 49. Then 49 minus the number in both equals 44. So, 49 - x = 44. Solving for x, which is the number in both, would be 49 - 44 = 5. So, 5 students are in both MATHCOUNTS and science club.

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a mistake in assumptions.

<prompt_1.1> Verify the calculation of the number of students in both MATHCOUNTS and science club. </prompt_1.1>

Alternatively, let's think about it another way. If 28 are in MATHCOUNTS and 21 in science, and 6 are out of both, then the overlap is the total in both clubs. So, the total in MATHCOUNTS or science is 28 + 21 - both. But since 44 are in at least one, then 28 +21 - both =44.
So both =28+21-44=5. Yep, same result.

Let me check if there's another approach. Maybe using a Venn diagram? Imagine two circles: one for MATHCOUNTS with 28, one for science with 21.

<prompt_1.2> Use a Venn diagram to verify the number of students in both MATHCOUNTS and science club. </prompt_1.2>

Another sanity check: if there were no overlap, then 28 +21=49 would be in the clubs, but since only 44 are in at least one, that means 49 -44=5 are counted twice, so that's the overlap. Exactly.

<prompt_1.3> Perform a sanity check on the solution to ensure the number of students in both MATHCOUNTS and science club is correct. </prompt_1.3>

Wait, but let me confirm once more. If 5 are in both, then the total in MATHCOUNTS only is 28 -5=23, and in science only is 21 -5=16. Then 23 +16 +5 (both) +6 (neither)=23+16=39, 39+5=44, 44+6=50.

<execution_1.1>
The total number in MATHCOUNTS is 28, science club is 21. If there's an overlap of 5, then the total number in either would be 28 + 21 - 5 = 44, which matches the 44 students who are in at least one club. Then the 6 students not in either make the total 44 + 6 = 50, which is correct.

<execution_1.2>
The intersection is both. The total in either is 44. So, 28 +21 - both =44. So again, both=5.
</execution_1.2>

<execution_1.3>
So, yes, that's correct. No issues here. I don't think I made any mistakes in the reasoning.

<Final_answer>
Therefore, the number of students who participate in both MATHCOUNTS and the science club is $\boxed{5}$.
