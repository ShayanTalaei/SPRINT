Okay, so I need to figure out how many positive whole-number divisors 196 has. Hmm, let's start by recalling what a divisor is.
A divisor of a number is another number that can divide into it without leaving a remainder. So, for example, 2 is a divisor of 4 because 4 divided by 2 is 2, which is an integer. Similarly, 1 and the number itself are always divisors. But 196 might have more than just 1, 2, 4, 49, 98, and 196.

Wait, how do I systematically find all the divisors of 196? I remember something about prime factorization. Let me try that.

First, let's break down 196 into its prime factors.

Starting with the smallest prime, 2. 196 divided by 2 is 98. Then divide 98 by 2 again to get 49. Now, 49 isn't divisible by 2, so I move to the next prime number, which is 3. But 49 divided by 3 isn't an integer. Next prime is 5; 49 divided by 5 also isn't an integer. Then 7. 49 divided by 7 is 7, and then dividing 7 by 7 gives 1. So the prime factors of 196 are 2^2 * 7^2.

Based on execution_1.1:
Now, I remember there's a formula for finding the number of divisors based on the exponents in the prime factorization. If a number N can be expressed as N = p1^a * p2^b * p3^c * ...., then the total number of divisors is (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... etc. So, in this case, since 196 is 2^2 * 7^2, the exponents are 2 and 2.
Applying the formula, that would be (2+1)*(2+1) = 3*3 = 9. So, 196 should have 9 divisors.

Let me verify that by listing them out to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from 1, then 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, 196.
That's 9 numbers. Each of these divides 196 without a remainder.

Wait, let me double-check each one. 196 ÷ 1 = 196, which is an integer. 196 ÷ 2 = 98, okay. 196 ÷ 4 = 49, correct.
196 ÷ 7 = 28, yes. 196 ÷ 14 = 14, right. 196 ÷ 28 = 7, that works. 196 ÷ 49 = 4, correct.

So, using both the formula and actual listing, I arrive at 9 divisors. Therefore, the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196 is 9.

I don't think I missed any. Let me just check if there's a divisor between 14 and 49 that I might have missed. For example, 28 is already there, and 196 divided by 28 is 7. So, the pairs are (1,196), (2,98), (4,49), (7,28), (14,14). Wait, 14 is repeated, but that's because 14 is the square root of 196. So, the pairs are these, and counting each pair gives two divisors except for the square root. So, total divisors are 2*4 -1 = 7? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no. Each pair contributes two divisors, except when the number is a perfect square, in which case the square root is only counted once. But in this case, since 196 is a perfect square, the total number of divisors should be odd. Since the formula gave 9, which is odd, that lines up. Let me list them again: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, 196. Yep, nine numbers.
