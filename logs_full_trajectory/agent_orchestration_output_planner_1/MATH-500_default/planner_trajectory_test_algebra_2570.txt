Okay, so I need to find the sum of all the multiples of 7 between 100 and 200. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. First, I remember that multiples of a number are just that number times any integer. So, multiples of 7 would be 7, 14, 21, 28, and so on. But here, we need the ones between 100 and 200. 

Wait, so I need to figure out which multiples of 7 fall into that range. Let me start by finding the first multiple of 7 that's greater than or equal to 100. To do that, maybe I can divide 100 by 7 and see what the quotient is. Let's see, 7 times 14 is 98, which is less than 100. Then 7 times 15 is 105. Okay, so 105 is the first multiple of 7 in the range. That makes sense.

Now, the last multiple of 7 before 200. Let me divide 200 by 7.
7 times 28 is 196, which is less than 200. 7 times 29 is 203, which is over 200. So, 196 is the last multiple of 7 in the range.

So now, the multiples of 7 between 100 and 200 are from 105 up to 196, increasing by 7 each time. This forms an arithmetic sequence. To find the sum of an arithmetic sequence, I know the formula is S = n/2 * (a₁ + aₙ), where n is the number of terms, a₁ is the first term, and aₙ is the last term. So I need to find how many terms there are in this sequence.

First term a₁ is 105, last term aₙ is 196. The common difference d is 7. To find the number of terms, n, I can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: aₙ = a₁ + (n - 1)d. Let me plug in the values I have.

<prompt_1.1> Use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence to find the number of terms. </prompt_1.1>

Alternatively, I could have used another formula for the sum: S = n/2 * [2a₁ + (n - 1)d]. Let me try that to verify.

<prompt_1.2> Use the formula S = n/2 * [2a₁ + (n - 1)d] to verify the sum. </prompt_1.2>

Alternatively, another way to check is using the formula S = n * a₁ + d * n(n - 1)/2. Let's see:

<prompt_1.3> Use the formula S = n * a₁ + d * n(n - 1)/2 to verify the sum. </prompt_1.3>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
196 = 105 + (n - 1)*7

Subtract 105 from both sides: 196 - 105 = (n - 1)*7

91 = (n - 1)*7

Divide both sides by 7: 91 / 7 = n - 1

13 = n - 1

So, n = 14.
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
So, S = 14/2 * [2*105 + (14 - 1)*7] = 7 * [210 + 13*7]. Let's compute 13*7: 91. Then 210 + 91 = 301. Then 7*301 = 2107.
</execution_1.2>

<execution_1.3>
S = 28 * 105 + 7 * 28 * 27 / 2. Let's compute this:

28 * 105 = 2940.

7 * 28 = 196; 196 * 27 = 5292; 5292 / 2 = 2646.

Adding them together: 2940 + 2646 = 5586.

Based on execution_1.1:
Wait, let me check that again. Let me list the terms to make sure there are 14 terms.

<prompt_2.1> List the terms of the sequence to verify the number of terms. </prompt_2.1>

Based on execution_1.2:
Just to be thorough, let me list out the terms and add them manually to check. The terms are:

105, 112, 119, 126, 133, 140, 147, 154, 161, 168, 175, 182, 189, 196.

Let me add them step by step:

<prompt_2.2> Manually add the listed terms to verify the sum. </prompt_2.2>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Starting at 105:

1. 105
2. 112
3. 119
4. 126
5. 133
6. 140
7. 147
8. 154
9. 161
10. 168
11. 175
12. 182
13. 189
14. 196
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
105 + 112 = 217

217 + 119 = 336

336 + 126 = 462

462 + 133 = 595

595 + 140 = 735

735 + 147 = 882

882 + 154 = 1036

1036 + 161 = 1197

1197 + 168 = 1365

1365 + 175 = 1540

1540 + 182 = 1722

1722 + 189 = 1911

1911 + 196 = 2107

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Now, using the sum formula S = n/2 * (a₁ + aₙ). Plugging in the numbers: n = 14, a₁ = 105, aₙ = 196.

<prompt_3.1> Use the sum formula S = n/2 * (a₁ + aₙ) to calculate the sum of the sequence. </prompt_3.1>

Based on execution_2.2:
That matches the previous results. So I'm confident that the sum is 2107.
Therefore, the answer should be 2107.
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
So S = 14/2 * (105 + 196) = 7 * 301. Let me compute 7 times 300 first, which is 2100, and then 7 times 1 is 7, so total is 2100 + 7 = 2107.
</execution_3.1>
</Execution_3>

<Final_answer>
Therefore, the sum of all the multiples of 9 between 100 and 200 is $\boxed{2107}$.
