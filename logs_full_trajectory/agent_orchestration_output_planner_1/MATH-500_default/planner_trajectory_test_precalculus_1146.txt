<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to find the constant d in the equation where (sin x)^7 is expressed as a combination of sin7x, sin5x, sin3x, and sinx. Hmm, I remember that powers of sine can be expanded using trigonometric identities, maybe multiple angle formulas or something like that. Let me think.

First, I recall that for lower powers, like (sin x)^2, we can use the identity sin^2 x = (1 - cos 2x)/2.
Maybe there's a similar identity for higher powers? I think there are formulas for sin^4 x, sin^6 x, etc. , using multiple angles. Let me try to remember or derive them.

For (sin x)^7, that's an odd power, so maybe I can use the identity sin^7 x = sin x * (sin^2 x)^3. Then, since (sin x)^2 = (1 - cos 2x)/2, perhaps substituting that in.

Let me write that down:

<prompt_1.1> Use the above plan to express (sin x)^7 in terms of multiple angle identities. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
sin^7 x = sin x * (sin^2 x)^3 = sin x * [(1 - cos 2x)/2]^3.

Expanding the cube: [ (1 - cos 2x)/2 ]^3 = (1/8)(1 - 3 cos 2x + 3 cos^2 2x - cos^3 2x).

So, sin^7 x = sin x * (1/8)(1 - 3 cos 2x + 3 cos^2 2x - cos^3 2x).

Now, I need to simplify the terms involving cos^2 2x and cos^3 2x. For cos^2 2x, there's an identity: cos^2 θ = (1 + cos 2θ)/2. So, cos^2 2x = (1 + cos 4x)/2.

For cos^3 2x, there's a formula as well. I think it can be expressed using multiple angles. Let me recall: cos^3 θ = (3 cos θ + cos 3θ)/4. Yes, that's right. So, cos^3 2x = (3 cos 2x + cos 6x)/4.

Putting these back into the equation:

First, expand the terms:

1. The constant term: 1/8 * sin x.
2. The cos 2x term: -3/8 * sin x * cos 2x.
3. The cos^2 2x term: 3/8 * sin x * (1 + cos 4x)/2 = 3/16 sin x + 3/16 sin x cos 4x.
4. The cos^3 2x term: -1/8 * sin x * (3 cos 2x + cos 6x)/4 = -3/32 sin x cos 2x - 1/32 sin x cos 6x.

Now, let's combine all these terms:

First, collect the sin x terms:

1/8 sin x + 3/16 sin x = (2/16 + 3/16) sin x = 5/16 sin x.

Next, the terms with cos 2x multiplied by sin x. Let's see:

-3/8 sin x cos 2x -3/32 sin x cos 2x = [ -3/8 - 3/32 ] sin x cos 2x.

Convert to 32 denominator:

-12/32 - 3/32 = -15/32 sin x cos 2x.

Then, the cos 4x term:

3/16 sin x cos 4x.

And the cos 6x term:

-1/32 sin x cos 6x.

So putting all together:

sin^7 x = 5/16 sin x - 15/32 sin x cos 2x + 3/16 sin x cos 4x - 1/32 sin x cos 6x.

Based on execution_1.1:
Now, I need to convert the terms like sin x cos 2x, sin x cos 4x, and sin x cos 6x into sums of sines, using the product-to-sum identities. Remember that sin A cos B = [sin(A+B) + sin(A-B)] / 2.

Let's apply that:

But let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the expansion. Let's retrace the steps.

Alternatively, maybe I can use another method to verify. For example, using complex exponentials. Let's see.

<prompt_2.3> Verify the result using complex exponentials as an alternative method. </prompt_2.3>

But just to be thorough, let me check if there's another way. Maybe using Fourier series or orthogonality.

First term: -15/32 sin x cos 2x = -15/32 [ sin(3x) + sin(-x) ] / 2 = Wait, no. Wait, sin(A) cos(B) = [ sin(A+B) + sin(A-B) ] / 2. So here, A is x, B is 2x. So:

sin x cos 2x = [ sin(x + 2x) + sin(x - 2x) ] / 2 = [ sin 3x + sin(-x) ] / 2 = [ sin 3x - sin x ] / 2.

Similarly, sin x cos 4x = [ sin(5x) + sin(-3x) ] / 2 = [ sin5x - sin3x ] / 2.

sin x cos 6x = [ sin7x + sin(-5x) ] / 2 = [ sin7x - sin5x ] / 2.

So substituting these back into the equation:

sin^7 x = 5/16 sin x - 15/32 * [ sin3x - sinx ] / 2 + 3/16 * [ sin5x - sin3x ] / 2 - 1/32 * [ sin7x - sin5x ] / 2.

Wait, let me check the coefficients:

For the first term: -15/32 multiplied by [ sin3x - sinx ] / 2, so overall coefficient is -15/32 * 1/2 = -15/64.

Similarly, the third term: 3/16 multiplied by [ sin5x - sin3x ] / 2, so coefficient is 3/16 * 1/2 = 3/32.

Fourth term: -1/32 multiplied by [ sin7x - sin5x ] / 2, so coefficient is -1/32 * 1/2 = -1/64.

Therefore, expanding all:

sin^7 x = 5/16 sinx -15/64 sin3x +15/64 sinx +3/32 sin5x -3/32 sin3x -1/64 sin7x +1/64 sin5x.

Now, let's collect like terms:

sinx terms: 5/16 +15/64 = convert to 64 denominator: 20/64 +15/64 =35/64.

sin3x terms: -15/64 -3/32 = -15/64 -6/64 = -21/64.

sin5x terms:3/32 +1/64 =6/64 +1/64=7/64.

sin7x terms: -1/64.

So putting it all together:

sin^7 x = (35/64) sinx - (21/64) sin3x + (7/64) sin5x - (1/64) sin7x.

Therefore, comparing with the original equation:

a sin7x + b sin5x + c sin3x + d sinx, we have:

a = -1/64, b=7/64, c= -21/64, d=35/64.

So the answer is d=35/64.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Starting from sin^7 x = sin x (sin^2 x)^3. Then sin^2 x = (1 - cos 2x)/2. Then the cube is correct. Expansion of (1 - cos 2x)^3 is 1 - 3 cos 2x + 3 cos^2 2x - cos^3 2x. Correct.

Then substituting cos^2 2x as (1 + cos 4x)/2, which is correct. And cos^3 2x as (3 cos 2x + cos 6x)/4, correct.

Then expanding each term multiplied by 1/8 and sin x. Then combining like terms. The sin x terms: 1/8 + 3/16 = 5/16. The cos 2x terms: -3/8 -3/32 = -15/32. The cos 4x term: 3/16. The cos 6x term: -1/32. All coefficients multiplied by sin x. Then converting the products to sum of sines. Seems correct.

So combining all terms, the coefficient for sin x is 5/16 - 15/32 + 3/16 - 1/32. Let me compute this again:

5/16 is 10/32, 3/16 is 6/32. So 10/32 -15/32 +6/32 -1/32 = (10 -15 +6 -1)/32 = 0/32. Wait, that can't be. Wait, but in the previous calculation, we had 5/16 sin x from the first part, and then the other terms had coefficients that included sin x cos terms. Wait, no, actually, when we converted the products, the sin x cos terms turned into sums of sin x sin terms. Wait, but when we did the product-to-sum identities, the terms like sin x cos 2x became [sin 3x + sin(-x)] / 2 = [sin 3x - sin x]/2. Similarly for the others.

So each of those terms would introduce a sin x term with a negative coefficient. So when we expand all of them, we need to collect all the sin x terms. Let me check again.

Original expansion after expanding everything:

sin^7 x = 5/16 sin x - 15/32 sin x cos 2x + 3/16 sin x cos 4x - 1/32 sin x cos 6x.

Then, each of the terms with sin x cos 2x, sin x cos 4x, sin x cos 6x need to be converted using product-to-sum:

-15/32 sin x cos 2x = -15/32 * [sin 3x - sin x]/2 = -15/64 sin 3x + 15/64 sin x.

Similarly, 3/16 sin x cos 4x = 3/16 * [sin 5x - sin 3x]/2 = 3/32 sin 5x - 3/32 sin 3x.

-1/32 sin x cos 6x = -1/32 * [sin 7x - sin 5x]/2 = -1/64 sin 7x + 1/64 sin 5x.

So, substituting all these back:

The sin x terms:

5/16 sin x + 15/64 sin x - 3/32 sin 3x - 3/32 sin 3x + 3/32 sin 5x + 1/64 sin 5x -1/64 sin 7x.

Wait, no. Wait, the 3/16 sin x cos 4x gives 3/32 sin 5x - 3/32 sin 3x. Similarly, the -1/32 sin x cos 6x gives -1/64 sin7x +1/64 sin5x. The -15/32 sinx cos2x gives -15/64 sin3x +15/64 sinx.

So, combining all terms:

sin x: 5/16 +15/64 = (20/64 +15/64)=35/64.

sin3x: -3/32 -15/64 = (-6/64 -15/64)= -21/64.

sin5x: 3/32 +1/64= (6/64 +1/64)=7/64.

sin7x: -1/64.

Therefore, the coefficient d for sinx is 35/64.

<execution_2.3>
Express sin^7 x as (sin x)^2 * (sin x)^2 * (sin x)^2 * sin x. Wait, but (sin x)^2 = (1 - cos 2x)/2. So, (sin x)^7 = sin x * [(1 - cos 2x)/2]^3. Wait, that's the same as before. So expanding that gives the same result.

Alternatively, maybe use the identity for sin^7 x directly. I think there is a formula for sin^n x in terms of multiple angles. For odd n, sin^n x can be expressed as a combination of sin(kx) where k ranges from 1 to n, in steps of 2. So, for n=7, we have sin x, sin 3x, sin 5x, sin 7x. Which matches the problem statement.

Alternatively, another approach is to use the complex exponential formula for sine. Recall that sin x = (e^(ix) - e^(-ix))/(2i). Therefore, sin^7 x = [ (e^(ix) - e^(-ix))/(2i) ]^7. Expanding this binomial might be tedious but could lead to the same result.

Let's try that.

First, expand [e^(ix) - e^(-ix)]^7 using the binomial theorem:

Sum_{k=0}^7 C(7,k) (-1)^k e^(i(7 - 2k)x).

Then, divide by (2i)^7 = 128 i^7 = 128 (-i) since i^7 = i^(4+3) = i^3 = -i.

So, sin^7 x = [Sum_{k=0}^7 C(7,k) (-1)^k e^(i(7 - 2k)x)] / (128 (-i)) = [Sum_{k=0}^7 C(7,k) (-1)^k e^(i(7 - 2k)x)] * i / 128.

Now, simplify the expression. Let's compute each term:

The exponents are e^(i(7 - 2k)x). For k from 0 to 7, the exponents are:

k=0: e^(i7x)

k=1: -e^(i5x)

k=2: e^(i3x)

k=3: -e^(ix)

k=4: e^(-i x)

k=5: -e^(-i3x)

k=6: e^(-i5x)

k=7: -e^(-i7x)

So, the sum is:

e^(i7x) - e^(i5x) + e^(i3x) - e^(ix) + e^(-ix) - e^(-i3x) + e^(-i5x) - e^(-i7x)

Multiply by i/128:

sin^7 x = [e^(i7x) - e^(i5x) + e^(i3x) - e^(ix) + e^(-ix) - e^(-i3x) + e^(-i5x) - e^(-i7x)] * i / 128.

Now, note that sin x = (e^(ix) - e^(-ix))/(2i), so multiplying by i gives:

i sin x = (e^(ix) - e^(-ix))/2.

Similarly, i sin 3x = (e^(i3x) - e^(-i3x))/2.

And so on. Therefore, each term in the brackets multiplied by i/128 can be written as:

[ e^(i7x) * i /128 ] - [ e^(i5x) * i /128 ] + [ e^(i3x) * i /128 ] - [ e^(ix) * i /128 ] + [ e^(-ix) * i /128 ] - [ e^(-i3x) * i /128 ] + [ e^(-i5x) * i /128 ] - [ e^(-i7x) * i /128 ].

Which is equivalent to:

(1/128)[ (e^(i7x) - e^(-i7x)) - (e^(i5x) - e^(-i5x)) + (e^(i3x) - e^(-i3x)) - (e^(ix) - e^(-ix)) ] / 2.

Wait, because i*(e^(iθ) - e^(-iθ)) = 2i sin θ, so dividing by 2i gives sin θ. Wait, no. Wait, let me check:

Wait, if we have (e^(iθ) - e^(-iθ))/(2i) = sin θ. Therefore, multiplying by i gives [e^(iθ) - e^(-iθ)]/2 = i sin θ. Therefore, each term in the brackets multiplied by i/128 is [e^(iθ) - e^(-iθ)]/2 * (1/64). So, each term is (i sin θ)/128 * 2? Wait, maybe I need to re-express this correctly.

Wait, let's take the first term: e^(i7x) * i /128. Since e^(i7x) * i = i e^(i7x) = [e^(i7x) - e^(-i7x)]/(2 sin θ)? Wait, maybe another approach.

Alternatively, notice that each pair like e^(i7x) - e^(-i7x) is equal to 2i sin7x. Therefore:

e^(i7x) - e^(-i7x) = 2i sin7x.

Similarly, e^(i5x) - e^(-i5x) = 2i sin5x, etc.

So, let's rewrite the expression:

[ e^(i7x) - e^(-i7x) - e^(i5x) + e^(-i5x) + e^(i3x) - e^(-i3x) - e^(ix) + e^(-ix) ] * i /128.

Grouping terms:

[ (e^(i7x) - e^(-i7x)) - (e^(i5x) - e^(-i5x)) + (e^(i3x) - e^(-i3x)) - (e^(ix) - e^(-ix)) ] * i /128.

Which is:

[2i sin7x - 2i sin5x + 2i sin3x - 2i sinx] * i /128.

Factor out 2i:

2i [ sin7x - sin5x + sin3x - sinx ] * i /128.

Multiply the terms:

2i * i [ sin7x - sin5x + sin3x - sinx ] /128.

Since i * i = -1, so:

2 * (-1) [ sin7x - sin5x + sin3x - sinx ] /128 = -2 [ sin7x - sin5x + sin3x - sinx ] /128 = [ -sin7x + sin5x - sin3x + sinx ] /64.

But according to the original equation, sin^7 x is equal to a sin7x + b sin5x + c sin3x + d sinx. Comparing the two expressions:

sin^7 x = [ -sin7x + sin5x - sin3x + sinx ] /64.

Therefore, matching coefficients:

a = -1/64,

b = 1/64,

c = -1/64,

d = 1/64.

Wait, but this contradicts the previous result where d was 1/16. Hmm, that's a problem. So which one is correct?
</execution_2.3>

<execution_2.4>
Since the identity holds for all x, the coefficients of corresponding sine terms must be equal. So, if I expand (sin x)^7 as a combination of sines, the coefficients for sin7x, sin5x, sin3x, sinx must match on both sides. So, if I use the orthogonality of sine functions over [0, 2π], multiplying both sides by sin nx and integrating from 0 to 2π would give d_n = (1/2) ∫ (sin x)^7 sin nx dx. For n=1, that integral would give 2d, since the coefficient of sinx is d. Wait, maybe this is another way to compute d.

But since we already did the expansion and got d=7/16, perhaps this is consistent. But let's see.

Alternatively, using complex exponentials. Let's recall that sin x = (e^(ix) - e^(-ix))/(2i). Therefore, (sin x)^7 = (e^(ix) - e^(-ix))^7 / (2i)^7.

Expanding the numerator using binomial theorem:

= 1/(2^7 i^7) * Σ_{k=0}^7 C(7,k) (-1)^k e^(i(7-2k)x)

Since i^7 = i^(4+3) = i^3 = -i, so 1/i^7 = 1/(-i)^7 = 1/(i^7) = 1/(-i) = i. Wait, maybe better to compute directly:

(2i)^7 = 128 i^7 = 128 (-i), so 1/(2i)^7 = -i / 128.

So,

(sin x)^7 = -i / 128 * Σ_{k=0}^7 C(7,k) (-1)^k e^(i(7-2k)x)

Simplify the exponent:

Each term is e^(i(7-2k)x). Let's compute the exponents for k from 0 to 7:

k=0: 7 - 0 =7

k=1:7 -2=5

k=2:7-4=3

k=3:7-6=1

k=4:7-8=-1

k=5:7-10=-3

k=6:7-12=-5

k=7:7-14=-7

Therefore, the exponents are 7,5,3,1,-1,-3,-5,-7.

So the terms are e^(i7x), e^(i5x), e^(i3x), e^(ix), e^(-ix), e^(-i3x), e^(-i5x), e^(-i7x).

Therefore, the sum can be written as:

Σ_{k=0}^7 C(7,k) (-1)^k e^(i(7-2k)x) = C(7,0)(-1)^0 e^(i7x) + C(7,1)(-1)^1 e^(i5x) + ... + C(7,7)(-1)^7 e^(-i7x)

Compute each coefficient:

For each term, coefficient is C(7,k)(-1)^k:

k=0: 1*1=1

k=1:7*(-1)^1= -7

k=2:21*(-1)^2=21

k=3:35*(-1)^3=-35

k=4:35*(-1)^4=35

k=5:21*(-1)^5=-21

k=6:7*(-1)^6=7

k=7:1*(-1)^7=-1

Therefore, the sum is:

1 e^(i7x) -7 e^(i5x) +21 e^(i3x) -35 e^(ix) +35 e^(-ix) -21 e^(-i3x) +7 e^(-i5x) -1 e^(-i7x)

Now, group the terms:

= [e^(i7x) - e^(-i7x)] -7 [e^(i5x) - e^(-i5x)] +21 [e^(i3x) - e^(-i3x)] -35 [e^(ix) - e^(-ix)].

Each of these brackets is 2i sin nx, so:

= 2i [ sin7x -7 sin5x +21 sin3x -35 sinx ]

Therefore, the entire expression:

(sin x)^7 = -i /128 * 2i [ sin7x -7 sin5x +21 sin3x -35 sinx ]

Simplify the constants:

-i * 2i = -2i^2 = -2(-1) = 2.

So,

(sin x)^7 = (2 /128) [ sin7x -7 sin5x +21 sin3x -35 sinx ]

Simplify 2/128 = 1/64.

Therefore,

(sin x)^7 = (1/64) sin7x - (7/64) sin5x + (21/64) sin3x - (35/64) sinx.

So, comparing with the original equation given in the problem:

(sin x)^7 = a sin7x + b sin5x + c sin3x + d sinx,

Therefore, the coefficient d is -35/64. Wait, but earlier I got 7/16. There's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?

Hmm, this is a problem. Let me check my previous steps.

First, in the complex exponential method, the result is clear: the coefficients are 1, -7, 21, -35 for sin7x, sin5x, sin3x, sinx. So, d is -35/64.

But in the first method, expanding via multiple angle identities, I got d=7/16. That's conflicting. So, which one is correct?

Let's check the first method again.
</execution_2.4>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2:
Wait, in the complex exponential method, expanding via binomial gives (sin x)^7 as a combination of sin7x, sin5x, sin3x, sinx with coefficients 1/64, -7/64, 21/64, -35/64. Therefore, d = -35/64. But in the first method, expanding via multiple angle identities, I had d=35/64. There's a sign difference. Which is correct?

Wait, let's check the first method again. In the first method, after expanding the product-to-sum identities, we had:

sin^7 x = 5/16 sinx -15/32 sinx cos2x +3/16 sinx cos4x -1/32 sinx cos6x.

Then converting the cos terms:

-15/32 sinx cos2x = -15/64 sin3x +15/64 sinx.

3/16 sinx cos4x = 3/32 sin5x -3/32 sin3x.

-1/32 sinx cos6x = -1/64 sin7x +1/64 sin5x.

So combining sinx terms:

5/16 +15/64 = (20/64 +15/64)=35/64.

But in the complex exponential method, the coefficient is -35/64. So there is a sign difference. Which is correct?

Alternatively, perhaps a mistake in the sign during the product-to-sum formulas.

Wait, product-to-sum identity for sin A cos B is [sin(A+B) + sin(A-B)] / 2. So, sinx cos2x = [sin3x + sin(-x)] / 2 = [sin3x - sinx]/2. Therefore, when we have -15/32 sinx cos2x, that is -15/32 * [sin3x - sinx]/2 = -15/64 sin3x +15/64 sinx. So that is correct.

Similarly, 3/16 sinx cos4x: [sin5x + sin(-3x)] / 2 = [sin5x - sin3x]/2. So 3/16 * [sin5x - sin3x]/2 = 3/32 sin5x -3/32 sin3x. Correct.

-1/32 sinx cos6x: [sin7x + sin(-5x)] /2 = [sin7x - sin5x]/2. So -1/32 * [sin7x - sin5x]/2 = -1/64 sin7x +1/64 sin5x. Correct.

Therefore, the sinx terms are 5/16 +15/64 =35/64. So in the first method, d=35/64, but in the complex exponential method, d=-35/64. So conflicting results. Therefore, there must be a mistake in one of the methods.

Wait, in the complex exponential method, the expansion was:

(sin x)^7 = (1/64) sin7x - (7/64) sin5x + (21/64) sin3x - (35/64) sinx.

So d=-35/64. But in the first method, we have d=35/64. Which is correct?

Alternatively, perhaps a miscalculation in the complex exponential method. Let me check the coefficients again.

Original expansion:

After expanding (e^(ix) - e^(-ix))^7, we had:

Σ_{k=0}^7 C(7,k) (-1)^k e^(i(7-2k)x) = e^(i7x) -7 e^(i5x) +21 e^(i3x) -35 e^(ix) +35 e^(-ix) -21 e^(-i3x) +7 e^(-i5x) - e^(-i7x).

Grouping terms:

= [e^(i7x) - e^(-i7x)] -7 [e^(i5x) - e^(-i5x)] +21 [e^(i3x) - e^(-i3x)] -35 [e^(ix) - e^(-ix)].

Each [e^(inx) - e^(-inx)] = 2i sin nx. Therefore:

= 2i sin7x -14i sin5x +42i sin3x -70i sinx.

Multiply by -i /128:

(sin x)^7 = (-i /128)(2i sin7x -14i sin5x +42i sin3x -70i sinx).

Compute each term:

First term: (-i /128)(2i sin7x) = (-i *2i)/128 sin7x = (-2i^2)/128 sin7x = (-2*(-1))/128 sin7x = 2/128 sin7x = 1/64 sin7x.

Second term: (-i /128)(-14i sin5x) = (14i^2)/128 sin5x = 14*(-1)/128 sin5x = -14/128 sin5x = -7/64 sin5x.

Third term: (-i /128)(42i sin3x) = (-42i^2)/128 sin3x = 42/128 sin3x = 21/64 sin3x.

Fourth term: (-i /128)(-70i sinx) = (70i^2)/128 sinx = 70*(-1)/128 sinx = -70/128 sinx = -35/64 sinx.

Therefore, combining all terms:

sin^7 x = (1/64) sin7x - (7/64) sin5x + (21/64) sin3x - (35/64) sinx.

So, the coefficient d is -35/64. But in the first method, we had 35/64. So why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps a sign error in the first method. Let me check the first method again.

In the first method, when expanding (sin x)^7 = sin x * (sin^2 x)^3, and sin^2 x = (1 - cos2x)/2. Then, (sin^2 x)^3 = (1 - 3 cos2x + 3 cos^2 2x - cos^3 2x)/8.

Then, expanding cos^2 2x as (1 + cos4x)/2, and cos^3 2x as (3 cos2x + cos6x)/4.

Substituting back, we have:

(1/8)(1 - 3 cos2x + 3*(1 + cos4x)/2 - (3 cos2x + cos6x)/4).

Expanding:

1/8 - 3/8 cos2x + 3/16 + 3/16 cos4x - 3/32 cos2x - 1/32 cos6x.

Combine constants: 1/8 + 3/16 = 2/16 + 3/16 = 5/16.

Cos2x terms: -3/8 -3/32 = -12/32 -3/32 = -15/32.

Cos4x term: 3/16.

Cos6x term: -1/32.

So, (sin^2 x)^3 = 5/16 -15/32 cos2x + 3/16 cos4x -1/32 cos6x.

Multiply by sinx:

sin^7 x = sinx*(5/16 -15/32 cos2x + 3/16 cos4x -1/32 cos6x).

Then, expanding each term:

5/16 sinx -15/32 sinx cos2x +3/16 sinx cos4x -1/32 sinx cos6x.

Then, converting each product-to-sum identity:

-15/32 sinx cos2x = -15/64 sin3x +15/64 sinx.

3/16 sinx cos4x = 3/32 sin5x -3/32 sin3x.

-1/32 sinx cos6x = -1/64 sin7x +1/64 sin5x.

So, combining all sinx terms:

5/16 +15/64 = 35/64.

But according to the complex exponential method, the coefficient of sinx is -35/64. Therefore, there is a sign error here. Let me check the product-to-sum formula again.

Wait, the product-to-sum identity is sin A cos B = [sin(A+B) + sin(A-B)] / 2. Therefore, sinx cos2x = [sin3x + sin(-x)] / 2 = [sin3x - sinx]/2. Therefore, multiplying by -15/32:

-15/32 * [sin3x - sinx]/2 = -15/64 sin3x +15/64 sinx. So that is correct.

Similarly, sinx cos4x = [sin5x + sin(-3x)] /2 = [sin5x - sin3x]/2. So 3/16 * [sin5x - sin3x]/2 = 3/32 sin5x -3/32 sin3x. Correct.

sinx cos6x = [sin7x + sin(-5x)] /2 = [sin7x - sin5x]/2. So -1/32 * [sin7x - sin5x]/2 = -1/64 sin7x +1/64 sin5x. Correct.

Therefore, the sinx terms are:

5/16 (from sinx) +15/64 (from -15/32 sinx cos2x) = 35/64. So according to the first method, d=35/64, but according to the complex exponential method, d=-35/64. Which is correct?

Wait, perhaps a miscalculation in the complex exponential method. Let's check the expansion again.

Original expansion via complex exponentials:

After expanding all terms, we have:

sin^7 x = (1/64) sin7x - (7/64) sin5x + (21/64) sin3x - (35/64) sinx.

But according to the first method, expanding via trigonometric identities gives:

sin^7 x = 35/64 sinx -15/32 sinx cos2x +3/16 sinx cos4x -1/32 sinx cos6x.

But when converting the products, as done, we end up with positive 35/64 sinx. However, the complex exponential method gives -35/64 sinx. So, conflicting signs.

Alternatively, perhaps a miscalculation in the complex exponential method. Let me recheck the coefficients:

Original expansion after expanding all terms:

sin^7 x = (1/64) sin7x - (7/64) sin5x + (21/64) sin3x - (35/64) sinx.

But according to the first method, after expanding and converting products, the coefficient of sinx is 35/64. Therefore, either there is a sign error in one of the methods, or perhaps an error in the product-to-sum formula.

Wait, perhaps the product-to-sum formula was misapplied. Let's check sinx cos2x again. The identity is sin A cos B = [sin(A+B) + sin(A-B)] / 2. So sinx cos2x = [sin(x+2x) + sin(x-2x)] / 2 = [sin3x + sin(-x)] / 2 = [sin3x - sinx]/2. Therefore, correct. Then multiplying by -15/32 gives -15/64 sin3x +15/64 sinx. Correct.

Similarly, sinx cos4x = [sin5x + sin(-3x)] /2 = [sin5x - sin3x]/2. Multiply by 3/16 gives 3/32 sin5x -3/32 sin3x. Correct.

sinx cos6x = [sin7x + sin(-5x)] /2 = [sin7x - sin5x]/2. Multiply by -1/32 gives -1/64 sin7x +1/64 sin5x. Correct.

Therefore, the only possible conclusion is that the first method has a sign error. But how?

Wait, perhaps in the first method, when expanding (sin^2 x)^3, there might be a miscalculation. Let's recompute that step.

Starting over:

(sin^2 x)^3 = [ (1 - cos2x)/2 ]^3 = (1 - 3 cos2x + 3 cos^2 2x - cos^3 2x)/8.

Then, cos^2 2x = (1 + cos4x)/2.

So, substituting:

(1 -3 cos2x + 3*(1 + cos4x)/2 - cos^3 2x)/8.

Compute each term:

1 remains 1.

-3 cos2x remains.

3*(1 + cos4x)/2 = 3/2 + 3/2 cos4x.

-cos^3 2x remains.

So, putting together:

1 -3 cos2x + 3/2 + 3/2 cos4x - cos^3 2x.

Combine constants: 1 +3/2 =5/2.

So, 5/2 -3 cos2x +3/2 cos4x -cos^3 2x.

Then, cos^3 2x = (3 cos2x + cos6x)/4. So:

5/2 -3 cos2x +3/2 cos4x - (3 cos2x + cos6x)/4.

Convert all terms to quarters:

5/2 =10/4.

-3 cos2x = -12/4 cos2x.

3/2 cos4x =6/4 cos4x.

- (3 cos2x + cos6x)/4 remains.

So:

10/4 -12/4 cos2x +6/4 cos4x -3/4 cos2x -1/4 cos6x.

Combine like terms:

cos2x: (-12/4 -3/4) = -15/4 cos2x.

cos4x:6/4 =3/2 cos4x.

cos6x: -1/4 cos6x.

Therefore, (sin^2 x)^3 = [10/4 -15/4 cos2x +3/2 cos4x -1/4 cos6x]/8.

Wait, no. Wait, (sin^2 x)^3 is equal to [5/2 -3 cos2x +3/2 cos4x -cos^3 2x]/8. But we expanded cos^3 2x as (3 cos2x + cos6x)/4. Therefore, substituting back:

[5/2 -3 cos2x +3/2 cos4x - (3 cos2x + cos6x)/4]/8.

Convert all terms to quarters:

5/2 =10/4,

-3 cos2x = -12/4 cos2x,

3/2 cos4x =6/4 cos4x,

- (3 cos2x + cos6x)/4 remains.

Therefore:

10/4 -12/4 cos2x +6/4 cos4x -3/4 cos2x -1/4 cos6x.

Combine:

cos2x: (-12/4 -3/4) = -15/4 cos2x.

cos4x:6/4 =3/2 cos4x.

cos6x:-1/4 cos6x.

Therefore, numerator is:

10/4 -15/4 cos2x +3/2 cos4x -1/4 cos6x.

Then, multiply by sinx and divide by8:

sin^7 x = sinx * [10/4 -15/4 cos2x +3/2 cos4x -1/4 cos6x]/8.

Which is:

sinx * [5/16 -15/32 cos2x +3/16 cos4x -1/32 cos6x].

Therefore, expanding:

5/16 sinx -15/32 sinx cos2x +3/16 sinx cos4x -1/32 sinx cos6x.

Which is the same as before. Then converting each product term:

-15/32 sinx cos2x = -15/64 sin3x +15/64 sinx.

3/16 sinx cos4x =3/32 sin5x -3/32 sin3x.

-1/32 sinx cos6x = -1/64 sin7x +1/64 sin5x.

Therefore, combining sinx terms:

5/16 +15/64 =35/64.

But according to the complex exponential method, the coefficient of sinx is -35/64. Therefore, conflicting results.

This suggests that there is a fundamental discrepancy. However, the complex exponential method is more straightforward and reliable because it directly uses Euler's formula and orthogonality. Therefore, the result from the complex exponential method is likely correct, and the error must be in the first method.

Wait, but why does the first method give a positive coefficient for sinx and the complex exponential method gives a negative coefficient? That suggests that perhaps during the expansion, a sign was mishandled. Wait, let's check the very first step.

Wait, when we expanded (sin^2 x)^3, we had [ (1 - cos2x)/2 ]^3. Then expanding that gives 1/8 (1 -3 cos2x +3 cos^2 2x -cos^3 2x). That seems correct.

Then, substituting cos^2 2x = (1 + cos4x)/2, which is correct.

Then, substituting cos^3 2x = (3 cos2x + cos6x)/4, which is correct.

Therefore, all steps seem correct. Then, why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps an error in the sign when expanding (sin^2 x)^3. Let me check:

Wait, (sin^2 x)^3 = sin^6 x. But in the first method, we wrote sin^7 x as sinx * (sin^2 x)^3. That is correct. Then, expanding (sin^2 x)^3 as [1 - cos2x]^3 /8. Then expanding that gives the terms as above.

Wait, but when we multiplied by sinx, the term sinx * [10/4 -15/4 cos2x +3/2 cos4x -1/4 cos6x]/8, which is equivalent to sinx * [5/16 -15/32 cos2x +3/16 cos4x -1/32 cos6x]. Then expanding each term:

sinx *5/16 sinx is 5/16 sinx.

sinx * (-15/32 cos2x) is -15/32 sinx cos2x.

Similarly for others.

But according to the complex exponential method, the coefficient of sinx is -35/64, but here it's +35/64. Therefore, this suggests a sign error in the first method.

Wait, but according to the complex exponential method, the coefficient of sinx is -35/64, which is the same as in the problem statement. The problem states that the coefficient d is d, and according to the complex exponential method, d=-35/64. However, in the first method, we arrived at d=35/64. Therefore, the first method must have a sign error.

But where?

Wait, perhaps in the very first step. Wait, when we expanded (sin^2 x)^3, we had [ (1 - cos2x)/2 ]^3. But is that correct?

Yes, because sin^2 x = (1 - cos2x)/2. Therefore, (sin^2 x)^3 = [(1 - cos2x)/2]^3 = (1 -3 cos2x +3 cos^2 2x -cos^3 2x)/8. Correct.

Then, substituting cos^2 2x and cos^3 2x. Correct.

Then, multiplying by sinx and expanding. So, unless there's a miscalculation in the fractions.

Wait, let's recompute the fractions:

After expanding, the numerator is:

5/2 -15/4 cos2x +3/2 cos4x -1/4 cos6x.

Then, multiplying by sinx and dividing by8:

sinx * [5/2 -15/4 cos2x +3/2 cos4x -1/4 cos6x] /8.

Which is:

sinx * [5/16 -15/32 cos2x +3/16 cos4x -1/32 cos6x].

Then, expanding each term:

sinx *5/16 =5/16 sinx.

sinx*(-15/32 cos2x)= -15/32 sinx cos2x.

sinx*3/16 cos4x=3/16 sinx cos4x.

sinx*(-1/32 cos6x)= -1/32 sinx cos6x.

Then, converting each product:

-15/32 sinx cos2x = -15/64 sin3x +15/64 sinx.

3/16 sinx cos4x =3/32 sin5x -3/32 sin3x.

-1/32 sinx cos6x = -1/64 sin7x +1/64 sin5x.

So combining sinx terms:

5/16 +15/64 = (20/64 +15/64)=35/64.

But according to the complex exponential method, the coefficient of sinx is -35/64. Therefore, there is a sign discrepancy. However, according to the complex exponential method, which is a more systematic and error-reducing approach, the answer should be d= -35/64. But the problem states the equation with d as the coefficient of sinx, and we need to find d. Therefore, according to the complex exponential method, the answer is -35/64. However, in the first method, we have a conflicting result. 

But why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps in the first method, when expanding (sin^2 x)^3, the sign is positive, but in reality, when multiplying by sinx, perhaps there is a sign error in the expansion. Alternatively, perhaps the complex exponential method is correct, and the first method has a miscalculation. 

Alternatively, perhaps the original problem statement is incorrect, but the problem states:

There exist constants a, b, c, and d... Find d.

So, according to the problem, the coefficient d is to be found. The complex exponential method gives d= -35/64, while the first method gives d=35/64. 

But the problem is from a math competition or textbook problem, and such problems typically have integer or simple fractional answers. Since -35/64 is a possible answer, but 35/64 is also possible. However, given that the complex exponential method is systematic, and the first method had a sign error in the product-to-sum formula, I need to check again.

Wait, the product-to-sum formula is sin A cos B = [sin(A+B) + sin(A-B)] / 2. Therefore, sinx cos2x = [sin3x + sin(-x)] / 2 = [sin3x - sinx]/2. Therefore, -15/32 sinx cos2x = -15/32 * [sin3x - sinx]/2 = -15/64 sin3x +15/64 sinx. So that term is correct.

Similarly, 3/16 sinx cos4x =3/16 * [sin5x + sin(-3x)] /2 =3/32 sin5x -3/32 sin3x. Correct.

-1/32 sinx cos6x = -1/32 * [sin7x + sin(-5x)] /2 = -1/64 sin7x +1/64 sin5x. Correct.

Therefore, combining sinx terms: 15/64 +15/32 =15/64 +30/64=45/64? Wait, no. Wait, in the first method, the expansion after converting products gives:

sin^7 x =5/16 sinx -15/32 sinx cos2x +3/16 sinx cos4x -1/32 sinx cos6x.

Then, converting each product:

-15/32 sinx cos2x = -15/64 sin3x +15/64 sinx.

3/16 sinx cos4x =3/32 sin5x -3/32 sinx.

-1/32 sinx cos6x =-1/64 sin7x +1/64 sin5x.

Therefore, the sinx terms are:

5/16 (from first term) +15/64 (from -15/32 sinx cos2x) -3/32 (from 3/16 sinx cos4x) +0 (from -1/32 sinx cos6x).

Therefore, converting all to 64 denominators:

5/16 =20/64,

15/64 remains,

-3/32 = -6/64.

So total sinx coefficient: 20/64 +15/64 -6/64=29/64. Wait, hold on, this contradicts previous calculation.

Wait, no. Wait, in the first method, after converting each product term, the sinx terms are:

From -15/32 sinx cos2x: +15/64 sinx.

From 3/16 sinx cos4x: -3/32 sinx.

From -1/32 sinx cos6x: 0.

Therefore, total sinx coefficient:

15/64 -3/32.

Convert 3/32 to 6/64.

So 15/64 -6/64 =9/64.

But according to the complex exponential method, it's -35/64. So this is conflicting.

Wait, but according to the expansion in the first method, after converting all the product terms, the sinx terms are:

5/16 (from the first term) +15/64 (from -15/32 sinx cos2x) -3/32 (from 3/16 sinx cos4x). 

But 5/16 is 20/64, 15/64 is 15/64, -3/32 is -6/64. So total: 20 +15 -6 =29/64.

But according to the complex exponential method, the coefficient is -35/64. Therefore, there is a miscalculation here. Wait, but according to the first method, after converting all the product terms, the sinx terms are:

5/16 sinx (from sin^7 x = sinx*(5/16)).

Then, from -15/32 sinx cos2x: converted to 15/64 sinx -15/64 sin3x.

From 3/16 sinx cos4x: converted to 3/32 sin5x -3/32 sin3x.

From -1/32 sinx cos6x: converted to 1/64 sin5x -1/64 sin7x.

Therefore, the sinx terms are:

5/16 (from first term) +15/64 (from -15/32 sinx cos2x) +0 (from 3/16 sinx cos4x) +0 (from -1/32 sinx cos6x).

So:

5/16 =20/64,

15/64 =15/64,

Total sinx coefficient:20/64 +15/64=35/64.

But according to the complex exponential method, it's -35/64. So this is a clear discrepancy.

This suggests that there is a sign error in the first method. However, I cannot find where the error is. The product-to-sum identities seem correctly applied. The expansion steps seem correct. The only possible explanation is that the complex exponential method is correct, and there is a sign error in the first method.

Alternatively, perhaps the original problem statement has a typo, but assuming it's correct, the complex exponential method is more reliable.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to express sin^7x as a combination of sine terms, but in the problem statement, it's written as a sum of sin7x, sin5x, sin3x, and sinx. However, according to the complex exponential method, the coefficient of sinx is negative. So perhaps the answer is -35/64.

But according to the first method, it's positive. Therefore, conflicting results.

Given that, but given that the complex exponential method is systematic and less error-prone, I will trust that result. Therefore, the answer is d= -35/64.

But wait, in the first method, after expanding and converting all terms, the coefficient of sinx is 35/64. However, the complex exponential method gives -35/64. Therefore, the discrepancy is a sign. Therefore, likely, the first method has a sign error.

Wait, but in the product-to-sum formula, when expanding sinx cos2x, we had sinx cos2x = [sin3x - sinx]/2. Therefore, multiplying by -15/32, we get -15/64 sin3x +15/64 sinx. So that term is correct.

Similarly, sinx cos4x: [sin5x - sin3x]/2. Multiply by 3/16: 3/32 sin5x -3/32 sin3x. Correct.

sinx cos6x: [sin7x - sin5x]/2. Multiply by -1/32: -1/64 sin7x +1/64 sin5x. Correct.

Therefore, all steps seem correct. Then why the complex exponential method gives a different result? 

Wait, unless the complex exponential method is incorrect. But how?

Wait, let me recheck the complex exponential method.

Starting with (sinx)^7 expressed as (e^x - e^{-x})^7 / (2i)^7. Then expanding via binomial theorem:

Sum_{k=0}^7 C(7,k) (-1)^{k} e^{i(7-2k)x}.

Then, dividing by (2i)^7 = -i /128. Therefore, multiplying by -i /128:

sin^7 x = [Sum_{k=0}^7 C(7,k) (-1)^k e^{i(7-2k)x} ] * (-i)/128.

Then, expanding each term:

For each k, term is C(7,k) (-1)^k (-i) e^{i(7-2k)x}/128.

Then, converting e^{i(7-2k)x} into cosine terms:

For each k, compute 7-2k:

k=0:7, k=1:5, k=2:3, k=3:1, k=4:-1, k=5:-3, k=6:-5, k=7:-7.

Then, for each term:

k=0:7: e^{i7x}/128 * 1 * (-i) = (-i/128) e^{i7x}.

Similarly, k=1:5: (-1)* (-i)/128 e^{i5x} = i/128 e^{i5x}.

k=2:3:1*(-i)/128 e^{i3x} = -i/128 e^{i3x}.

k=3:1: -1*(-i)/128 e^{ix} = i/128 e^{ix}.

k=4:-1:1*(-i)/128 e^{-ix} = -i/128 e^{-ix}.

k=5:-3:-1*(-i)/128 e^{-i3x} = i/128 e^{-i3x}.

k=6:-5:1*(-i)/128 e^{-i5x} = -i/128 e^{-i5x}.

k=7:-7:-1*(-i)/128 e^{-i7x} = i/128 e^{-i7x}.

Then, grouping terms:

e^{i7x} and e^{-i7x}: (-i/128 + i/128) =0.

e^{i5x} and e^{-i5x}: i/128 + (-i)/128 =0.

e^{i3x} and e^{-i3x}: -i/128 +i/128=0.

e^{ix} and e^{-ix}: i/128 -i/128=0.

Wait, but then all terms cancel out? That can't be. But that would imply sin^7 x=0, which is impossible.

Wait, this suggests a mistake in the process. Wait, no, actually, in the complex exponential method, after expanding all terms, the coefficients for each exponential term sum up as follows:

For e^{i7x}: coefficient is (-i)/128.

For e^{i5x}: coefficient is i/128.

For e^{i3x}: coefficient is -i/128.

For e^{ix}: coefficient is i/128.

For e^{-ix}: coefficient is -i/128.

For e^{-i3x}: coefficient is i/128.

For e^{-i5x}: coefficient is -i/128.

For e^{-i7x}: coefficient is i/128.

Therefore, grouping terms:

sin^7 x = [ (-i/128) e^{i7x} + i/128 e^{-i7x} ] + [i/128 e^{i5x} -i/128 e^{-i5x} ] + [ -i/128 e^{i3x} +i/128 e^{-i3x} ] + [i/128 e^{ix} -i/128 e^{-ix} ].

Each pair can be converted using Euler's formula:

For e^{i7x} and e^{-i7x}: (-i/128)(e^{i7x} - e^{-
