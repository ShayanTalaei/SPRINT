Okay, so I need to find the angle between two lines in 3D space. The lines are defined by the equations 2x = 3y = -z and 6x = -y = -4z. Hmm, I remember that to find the angle between two lines, I should first find the direction vectors of each line and then use the dot product formula. The formula for the angle θ between two vectors u and v is cosθ = (u · v) / (|u| |v|). Then I can take the arccos of that result to get the angle in degrees.

First, let me figure out the direction vectors for both lines. Starting with the first line: 2x = 3y = -z. I think when an equation is given in the form of equalities like this, it's a parametric line. So maybe I can rewrite each variable in terms of a parameter. Let me set 2x = 3y = -z = t, where t is a parameter. Then, solving for each variable:

<prompt_1.1> Determine the direction vector for the line defined by 2x = 3y = -z by setting each variable in terms of a parameter. </prompt_1.1>

Now, the second line: 6x = -y = -4z. Similarly, let me set 6x = -y = -4z = s, where s is another parameter. Then solving for each variable:

<prompt_1.2> Determine the direction vector for the line defined by 6x = -y = -4z by setting each variable in terms of a parameter. </prompt_1.2>

Alternatively, if I use another parameter for the second line, maybe I can scale it differently. Let me see.

For x: 2x = t ⇒ x = t/2

For y: 3y = t ⇒ y = t/3

For z: -z = t ⇒ z = -t

So, the parametric equations for the first line are x = t/2, y = t/3, z = -t. Therefore, the direction vector for this line can be found by looking at the coefficients of t in each equation. So, the direction vector u is (1/2, 1/3, -1). But working with fractions can be a bit messy. Maybe I can scale this vector to make it simpler. If I multiply each component by 6 (the least common multiple of 2 and 3), I get (3, 2, -6). So, the direction vector u can also be written as (3, 2, -6).

<execution_1.2>
For 6x = s, so x = s/6.

For -y = s, so y = -s.

For -4z = s, so z = -s/4.

Therefore, the parametric equations for the second line are x = s/6, y = -s, z = -s/4. So the direction vector here is (1/6, -1, -1/4). Hmm, but direction vectors can be scaled by any non-zero scalar, so maybe it's easier to eliminate the fractions. If I multiply each component by 12 (the least common multiple of 6 and 4), then the direction vector becomes (2, -12, -3). Let me check: 12*(1/6) = 2, 12*(-1) = -12, 12*(-1/4) = -3. Yep, that works. So the direction vector for the second line is (2, -12, -3).

Suppose for the second line, instead of setting 6x = -y = -4z = s, maybe I could set it equal to a different parameter. But regardless, the direction vector would be proportional to (1/6, -1, -4). If I scale s to be 6s, then the parameterization becomes x = s, y = -6s, z = -4s, which is the same as before. So regardless of the parameter, the direction vector is a scalar multiple of (1/6, -1, -4), so the direction vector is uniquely defined up to scalar multiples. Therefore, (6, -1, -24) is just a scalar multiple (specifically, 6 times (1/6, -1, -4)), so the direction vector can be written as (6, -1, -24) if needed. But the direction is the same as (1/6, -1, -4) or (6, -1, -24). So either way, the direction is consistent.

Based on execution_1.1, execution_1.2:
Now, I have both direction vectors:

<prompt_2.1> Verify the direction vectors obtained for both lines. </prompt_2.1>

Based on execution_1.2:
Wait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in scaling. Let's verify the direction vectors again.

<prompt_2.2> Re-verify the direction vectors and their dot product to ensure accuracy. </prompt_2.2>

Based on execution_1.1, execution_1.2:
Now, plugging into the formula:

u · v = 3*2 + 2*(-12) + (-6)*(-3) = 6 - 24 + 18 = 0.

Wait, that's zero?

<prompt_2.3> Verify the calculation of the dot product and confirm the perpendicular result. </prompt_2.3>

But let me double-check all steps to be sure.

First direction vector:

<prompt_2.4> Re-evaluate the direction vectors and their dot product to ensure accuracy. </prompt_2.4>

But let me just visualize this to make sure. If two lines in 3D have direction vectors that are perpendicular, then their dot product is zero. But is there a possibility that even if the direction vectors are perpendicular, the lines might not be?

First line: u = (3, 2, -6)

Second line: v = (2, -12, -3)

Wait, let me confirm that. For the second line, the parametric equations are x = s/6, y = -s, z = -s/4. So the direction vector is (1/6, -1, -1/4). To eliminate denominators, multiply each component by 12: 12*(1/6) = 2, 12*(-1) = -12, 12*(-1/4) = -3. So yes, (2, -12, -3).

First line: 2x = 3y = -z. Let’s set t = 2x, then x = t/2. Then 3y = t ⇒ y = t/3, and -z = t ⇒ z = -t. So parametric equations are x = t/2, y = t/3, z = -t. So the direction vector is (1/2, 1/3, -1). Scaling by 6 gives (3, 2, -6). That seems right.

Second line: 6x = -y = -4z. Let’s set s = 6x, so x = s/6. Then -y = s ⇒ y = -s. And -4z = s ⇒ z = -s/4. So parametric equations: x = s/6, y = -s, z = -s/4. Direction vector is (1/6, -1, -1/4). Scaling by 12 gives (2, -12, -3). Correct.

So direction vectors are (3,2,-6) and (2,-12,-3). Then the dot product is 3*2 + 2*(-12) + (-6)*(-3) = 6 -24 +18 = 0.

<execution_2.3>
So the dot product is 6 - 24 + 18 = 0. So that's zero. Then cosθ = 0 / (|u| |v|). Therefore, cosθ = 0, which implies θ = 90 degrees. So the angle between the two lines is 90 degrees.

<execution_2.4>
First line: 2x = 3y = -z. Let me set t = 2x, so 3y = t ⇒ y = t/3, and -z = t ⇒ z = -t. Therefore, x = t/2, y = t/3, z = -t. So, the parametric equations are x = (1/2)t, y = (1/3)t, z = -t. So, direction vector is (1/2, 1/3, -1). Scaling by 6 gives (3, 2, -6). Correct.

Second line: 6x = -y = -4z. Let me set s = 6x, so -y = s ⇒ y = -s, and -4z = s ⇒ z = -s/4. Then x = s/6. So parametric equations: x = (1/6)s, y = -s, z = -s/4. So, direction vector is (1/6, -1, -1/4). Scaling by 12 gives (2, -12, -3). Correct.

Dot product: (3)(2) + (2)(-12) + (-6)(-3) = 6 - 24 + 18 = 0.

Wait, no. The angle between two lines is determined solely by their direction vectors, regardless of their position in space. So even if the lines are skew, the angle between them is still the angle between their direction vectors. So in this case, since the direction vectors are perpendicular, the angle between the lines is 90 degrees.
