</Question>

<think>
<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to find the smallest positive integer multiple of 30 that can be written using only the digits 0 and 2. Let me start by breaking down the problem step by step.

<prompt_1.1> Break down the problem by identifying the conditions for a number to be a multiple of 30 and to consist only of the digits 0 and 2. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
First, I know that a multiple of 30 must be divisible by 30. And 30 itself factors into 2, 3, and 5. So, for a number to be divisible by 30, it needs to satisfy the divisibility rules for 2, 3, and 5. Let me recall those rules:

1. **Divisibility by 2**: The number must be even, so its last digit has to be even. Since we can only use 0 and 2, the last digit should be 0 or 2. But since 2 is even and 0 is also even, that's okay.
2. **Divisibility by 5**: The number must end with 0 or 5. However, since we can only use digits 0 and 2, the last digit must be 0. So, whatever number we come up with, it has to end with a 0.
3. **Divisibility by 3**: The sum of the digits must be divisible by 3. Since the digits can only be 0 and 2, the sum will be 2 times the number of 2s in the number. Therefore, 2 * (number of 2s) must be divisible by 3. That means the number of 2s must be a multiple of 3 because 2 and 3 are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1). So, the count of 2s in the number should be 3, 6, 9, etc.

Putting this together, the number we're looking for must end with a 0 (to satisfy divisibility by 2 and 5) and have a number of 2s that is a multiple of 3 (to satisfy divisibility by 3). Also, the number should be as small as possible.

Since we want the smallest such number, we should aim for the least number of digits. Let's start with the smallest possible numbers and check if they meet the criteria.
</execution_1.1>
</Execution_1>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
First, let's consider the minimal length. The number must end with 0, so the shortest possible number would be a two-digit number: "20".

<prompt_2.1> Check if the two-digit number "20" meets the criteria for being a multiple of 30. </prompt_2.1>

Next, check a three-digit number. The smallest three-digit number ending with 0 using 0 and 2 is "200".

<prompt_2.2> Check if the three-digit number "200" meets the criteria for being a multiple of 30. </prompt_2.2>

But wait, maybe there's a smaller three-digit number with two 2s? For example, "220" or "202".

<prompt_2.3> Verify if "220" and "202" are valid candidates and check their divisibility by 3. </prompt_2.3>

So, moving on to four-digit numbers. The smallest four-digit number ending with 0 is "2000".

<prompt_2.4> Check if the four-digit number "2000" meets the criteria for being a multiple of 30. </prompt_2.4>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Let's check if 20 is divisible by 30. 20 divided by 30 is 2/3, which is not an integer. So, 20 is not a multiple of 30. The sum of its digits is 2 + 0 = 2, which isn't divisible by 3, so that's why.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Let's check the divisibility by 3. The sum of the digits for "200" is 2 + 0 + 0 = 2, which is not divisible by 3. So, "200" is out.

Next, check "220". The sum of digits is 2 + 2 + 0 = 4, which is also not divisible by 3. Then "202" (sum 2 + 0 + 2 = 4, same issue). So three-digit numbers with two 2s don't work. What if we have three 2s? Then the number would be "2220" (four digits), but let's check smaller numbers first.

Wait, maybe a four-digit number with three 2s. Let's see. The smallest four-digit number with three 2s and ending with 0 would be "2220". But maybe there's a smaller one. Let's see. If we arrange the digits with two 2s and two 0s, but since it's a four-digit number, the first digit must be 2. Then, the remaining digits can be arranged. For example, "2200" (sum 2+2+0+0=4, not divisible by 3), "2020" (sum 2+0+2+0=4), "2002" (ends with 2, which is invalid because it needs to end with 0). So, all four-digit numbers with two 2s and two 0s (ending with 0) have digit sums of 4, which isn't divisible by 3. So, moving on to three 2s. Then the sum would be 2*3=6, which is divisible by 3. So a four-digit number with three 2s and one 0, ending with 0. The smallest such number would be "2220". Let's check: 2+2+2+0=6, which is divisible by 3. It ends with 0, so divisible by 2 and 5. So, "2220" is a candidate.
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
But "220" has two 2s, which isn't a multiple of 3. Let's check:

- "220": digits sum to 2 + 2 + 0 = 4, which isn't divisible by 3.
- "202": digits sum to 2 + 0 + 2 = 4, same issue.
</execution_2.3>

<execution_2.4>
But maybe there's a smaller four-digit number with three 2s? For example, "2220".

But let's check step by step.

Starting with two-digit numbers:

1. "20": digits sum to 2 + 0 = 2. 2 is not divisible by 3. So, 20 is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 20 is out.
</execution_2.4>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1, execution_2.2, execution_2.3, execution_2.4:
Three-digit numbers:

- "200": sum 2. Not divisible by 3.
- "220": sum 4. Not divisible by 3.
- "202": sum 4. Not divisible by 3.

Four-digit numbers:

First, numbers with two 2s:

<prompt_3.1> Check four-digit numbers with two 2s for divisibility by 30. </prompt_3.1>

Now, numbers with three 2s:

Possible four-digit numbers ending with 0:

<prompt_3.2> Check four-digit numbers with three 2s for divisibility by 30. </prompt_3.2>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
- "2000": sum 2. Not divisible by 3.
- "2200": sum 4. Not divisible by 3.
- "2020": sum 4.
- "2002": invalid (ends with 2).
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
- "2220": sum 6. Divisible by 3. So, 2220 is a multiple of 30.

But is there a smaller number than 2220 that meets the criteria? Let's check numbers with three 2s but arranged differently.

For example, "2202" ends with 2, which is invalid. So, the last digit must be 0. So, the three 2s must be in the first three digits, with the last digit being 0. So, the smallest such number is "2220". However, maybe there's a number with more digits but smaller in value? Wait, no. Since "2220" is a four-digit number, any number with more digits would be larger. So, "2220" is the smallest four-digit number that meets the criteria.

But let's confirm if there's a smaller number with three 2s. Wait, three 2s in a four-digit number. The first digit must be 2, then the other two 2s can be in the remaining three positions (but the last digit must be 0). So, the possible numbers are:

- 2220 (sum 6)
- 2202 (invalid, ends with 2)
- 2022 (ends with 2, invalid)
- 0222 (invalid, starts with 0)

So, the only valid four-digit number with three 2s is 2220. Therefore, 2220 is a candidate. But is that the smallest?

Wait, maybe there's a number with six digits but smaller in magnitude? Wait, no. The number of digits determines the magnitude. A four-digit number is smaller than a five-digit number, etc. So, if 2220 is a four-digit number, it's smaller than any five-digit number. But maybe there's a smaller four-digit number with three 2s? Let's see. If we have three 2s and one 0, the smallest number would be arranging the digits with the 0 as far to the right as possible. Since the last digit must be 0, the 0 is fixed at the end. Then, the first three digits are 2s. So, 2220 is indeed the smallest four-digit number with three 2s and ending with 0.
</execution_3.2>
</Execution_3>

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.2:
But wait, let's check if 2220 is actually a multiple of 30. Let's divide 2220 by 30.

<prompt_4.1> Verify if "2220" is a multiple of 30 and consider if a smaller number exists. </prompt_4.1>

But hold on, maybe there's a smaller number with more digits but smaller in value? Wait, no. For example, a five-digit number starting with 2 followed by more digits. But a four-digit number is smaller than any five-digit number. So, if 2220 is a valid number, it's the smallest. However, let me check if there's a three-digit number with three 2s, but that would be "222", which ends with 2, so it's invalid. So, three 2s in a three-digit number is impossible because the last digit has to be 0.

So, the next possible is four digits with three 2s and one 0. So, 2220 is the smallest.

But let me verify again. Let me check numbers with three 2s and one 0, arranged so that the 0 is at the end.

<prompt_4.2> Re-evaluate the arrangement of digits to confirm "2220" as the smallest number. </prompt_4.2>

However, let's check if 2220 is indeed the minimal. Let's see if there's a smaller number with more digits but smaller in value. Wait, but more digits would make it larger. For example, a six-digit number would be bigger than a four-digit number. So, 2220 is four digits, which is smaller than, say, 22200.

But let's check if there is a smaller four-digit number. Wait, 2220 is the smallest four-digit number with three 2s and a trailing 0. If we try to put the 0 in the second position, we get 2020, but that has two 2s (digits 1 and 3), sum is 2 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 4, which isn't divisible by 3. Similarly, 2002 is invalid. So, no.

But let me check all possibilities. Let's list all four-digit numbers ending with 0, composed of 2s and 0s, with three 2s:

<prompt_4.3> Check all possibilities of four-digit numbers ending with 0 for divisibility by 30. </prompt_4.3>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
30 times 74 is 2220. Yes, 30*74=2220. So, that works.

But is there a smaller number than 2220 that meets the criteria? Let's check. Maybe a six-digit number? Wait, no. Because a four-digit number is smaller than a six-digit number. So, 2220 is a four-digit number, which is smaller than any number with five or six digits. But perhaps there is a three-digit number? Wait, we already saw that three-digit numbers can't have three 2s (since they need to end with 0, so two 2s and one 0, but sum of digits is 4, not divisible by 3). So, moving up to four digits.
</execution_4.1>

<execution_4.2>
The only way is 2220. So, 2220 is the number. Let's confirm:

- Divisible by 2: Ends with 0. Check.
- Divisible by 5: Ends with 0. Check.
- Divisible by 3: Sum of digits 2+2+2+0=6. 6 is divisible by 3. Check.
- Therefore, 2220 is divisible by 30.
</execution_4.2>

<execution_4.3>
- The three 2s must be in the first three digits. Since the number ends with 0, the possible numbers are:

1. 2220
2. 2202 (invalid, ends with 2)
3. 2022 (invalid, ends with 2)
4. 0222 (invalid, starts with 0)

So, only 2220 is valid. Therefore, 2220 is the only four-digit number that fits the criteria. Therefore, it's a candidate.

But let's check if there's a smaller number with more digits but smaller in magnitude. Wait, no, because adding more digits would make the number larger. For example, 2220 is four digits. Any number with five digits starting with 2 would be 20000 or higher, which is larger than 2220.

But wait, maybe there is a number with three 2s and one 0, but arranged differently. Wait, in four digits, the only valid one is 2220. So, 2220 is the candidate.

But let's check if 2220 is indeed the minimal. Alternatively, maybe there's a number with six digits but with three 2s and three 0s, arranged such that the sum of digits is 6 (divisible by 3), but the number is smaller. Wait, but 2220 is 2220, which is 2.22 thousand. If we have a six-digit number starting with 2 and then more digits, it would be at least 200,000, which is way larger. So, no, that's not possible.

Therefore, 2220 is the smallest. But let me verify by checking smaller multiples of 30 and see if they can be formed with 0s and 2s.

Alternatively, perhaps 2220 is not the minimal. Let's check multiples of 30 and see if their digits consist only of 0 and 2.

Starting from 30:

30: digits 3 and 0. Invalid (contains 3).

60: 6 and 0. Invalid.

90: 9 and 0. Invalid.

120: 1, 2, 0. Contains 1. Invalid.

150: 1,5,0. Invalid.

180: 1,8,0. Invalid.

210: 2,1,0. Contains 1. Invalid.

240: 2,4,0. Invalid.

270: 2,7,0. Invalid.

300: 3,0,0. Invalid.

330: 3,3,0. Invalid.

360: 3,6,0. Invalid.

390: 3,9,0. Invalid.

420: 4,2,0. Invalid.

450: 4,5,0. Invalid.

480: 4,8,0. Invalid.

510: 5,1,0. Invalid.

540: 5,4,0. Invalid.

570: 5,7,0. Invalid.

600: 6,0,0. Invalid.

630: 6,3,0. Invalid.

660: 6,6,0. Invalid.

690: 6,9,0. Invalid.

720: 7,2,0. Contains 7. Invalid.

750: 7,5,0. Invalid.

780: 7,8,0. Invalid.

810: 8,1,0. Invalid.

840: 8,4,0. Invalid.

870: 8,7,0. Invalid.

900: 9,0,0. Invalid.

930: 9,3,0. Invalid.

960: 9,6,0. Invalid.

990: 9,9,0. Invalid.

1020: 1,0,2,0. Contains 1. Invalid.

1050: 1,0,5,0. Invalid.

1080: 1,0,8,0. Invalid.

1110: 1,1,1,0. Invalid.

1140: 1,1,4,0. Invalid.

1170: 1,1,7,0. Invalid.

1200: 1,2,0,0. Contains 1. Invalid.

... (This is taking too long. There must be a better way. )

Alternatively, since the number must end with 0, let's represent it as N = 10 * M, where M is some integer composed of 2s and 0s. Then, N must also be divisible by 3, so the sum of its digits (which is 2*(number of 2s) + 0*(number of 0s) = 2k, where k is the number of 2s) must be divisible by 3. Therefore, 2k ≡ 0 mod 3 ⇒ k ≡ 0 mod 3. So, the number of 2s must be a multiple of 3. Therefore, the minimal k is 3. So, the minimal number of 2s is 3. Therefore, the minimal number would be the smallest number with three 2s and the rest 0s, ending with 0. So, arranging the digits to form the smallest possible number: place the 2s as left as possible, but ensuring the last digit is 0. So, the smallest number would be 2220. Because:

- The first three digits are 2s, and the last digit is 0. So, 2220. If we try to arrange the 0s earlier, like 2202, but that ends with 2, which is invalid. Similarly, 2022 ends with 2. 0222 is invalid. So, the only valid arrangement with three 2s and one 0 (ending with 0) is 2220.

Therefore, 2220 is the minimal number. Let's confirm that 2220 is divisible by 30. 2220 ÷ 30 = 74. So, 30 * 74 = 2220. Yes, that's correct.

</Execution_4>

<Plan_5>
Based on execution_4.3:
But wait, is there a smaller number with more digits but smaller in value? For example, 20020? Wait, 20020 has digits 2,0,0,2,0. Sum of digits is 2+2=4, which isn't divisible by 3. So, 20020 divided by 30 is 667.333... Not an integer.

<prompt_5.1> Verify if numbers with more digits but smaller magnitude than 2220 exist. </prompt_5.1>
</Plan_5>

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
So, that's out. Similarly, 20200: sum 2+2=4. Not divisible by 3. So, no.

Alternatively, maybe a number with six 2s? But 2220 is already smaller. So, 2220 is the minimal.

But just to be thorough, let's check if there's a number with three 2s and one 0, but arranged differently. For example, 2020: sum is 4. Not divisible by 3. 2002: ends with 2. Invalid. 0220: starts with 0. Invalid. So, no. Therefore, 2220 is the only four-digit number that fits.

But let's confirm once again. Let's think of the number as N = 2...20, where the number of 2s is a multiple of 3. The smallest such number is with three 2s: 2220. So, yes. Therefore, 2220 is the minimal number.

But wait, another approach: Let's model this as a number composed of 2s and 0s, ending with 0, and the sum of digits divisible by 3. So, the sum of digits is 2*k, where k is the number of 2s. So, 2*k must be divisible by 3 ⇒ k divisible by 3. So, the minimal k is 3. Therefore, the minimal number would have three 2s and the rest 0s, ending with 0. The smallest such number is 2220. Therefore, 2220 is the answer.

But let me check if there is a smaller number with more digits but smaller in value. For example, 20020 is five digits, but 20020 is larger than 2220. Similarly, 20200 is also larger. So, no. Therefore, 2220 is indeed the smallest.

But to be absolutely sure, let's check if there's a number with three 2s and one 0, but arranged as 2202, but that ends with 2. So, invalid. 2022 ends with 2. 0222 invalid. So, no. Therefore, 2220 is the only four-digit number that works. Hence, 2220 is the minimal multiple of 30 using only digits 0 and 2.
</execution_5.1>
</Execution_5>

<Plan_6>
Based on execution_5.1:
Wait, but let me check another angle. Suppose we consider numbers with more 2s but fewer digits. For example, a six-digit number with two 2s and four 0s: sum is 4, which isn't divisible by 3. If we have three 2s and three 0s, sum is 6, which is divisible by 3. So, a six-digit number like 222000. But 222000 is larger than 2220, so 2220 is still smaller.

Alternatively, maybe a number with three 2s and one 0 in five digits: 22200. Sum is 6, divisible by 3. Ends with 0. So, 22200 is a five-digit number. But 22200 is larger than 2220, so 2220 is still smaller.

Another idea: Maybe a number like 2220, but with fewer digits. Wait, we already checked four digits. So, 2220 is four digits.

But let me check if there's a three-digit number with three 2s, but that would be 222, which ends with 2. So, invalid. So, no.

Therefore, after all this analysis, I conclude that the least positive integer multiple of 30 that can be written with only the digits 0 and 2 is 2220.
