Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a cubic equation: 8x³ + 4a x² + 2b x + a = 0, and it's given that this equation has three distinct positive roots. Also, the sum of the base-2 logarithms of the roots is 5. We need to find the value of 'a'.

Hmm, let's recall some properties of polynomial roots. For a cubic equation of the form px³ + qx² + rx + s = 0, the sum of the roots is -q/p, the sum of the product of roots two at a time is r/p, and the product of the roots is -s/p. These are known as Vieta's formulas. Since all roots are positive here, their product should be positive, which might help us later.

First, let's write down Vieta's formulas for this specific equation.

<prompt_1.1> Apply Vieta's formulas to the given cubic equation to express the sum, product, and sum of products of the roots in terms of the coefficients. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
The given equation is 8x³ + 4a x² + 2b x + a = 0. Comparing this to the general form, p = 8, q = 4a, r = 2b, s = a.

Let the roots be α, β, and γ. Then according to Vieta's formulas:

1. Sum of roots: α + β + γ = -q/p = -4a/8 = -a/2.
2. Sum of products two at a time: αβ + αγ + βγ = r/p = 2b/8 = b/4.
3. Product of roots: αβγ = -s/p = -a/8.

But wait, the problem states that all roots are positive. So, α, β, γ > 0. That means their sum, sum of products, and product should all be positive as well. Let's check the expressions from Vieta's formulas:

- Sum of roots: α + β + γ = -a/2. Since the sum is positive (sum of positive numbers), -a/2 > 0 ⇒ a < 0.
- Product of roots: αβγ = -a/8. Similarly, since the product is positive (product of three positive numbers), -a/8 > 0 ⇒ a < 0.
- The sum of products two at a time: αβ + αγ + βγ = b/4. This must be positive as well since it's the sum of products of positive numbers. Therefore, b/4 > 0 ⇒ b > 0.

So, we know that a is negative.

Based on execution_1.1:
Now, the problem also mentions that the sum of the base-2 logarithms of the roots is 5. Let's write that down:

<prompt_2.1> Translate the given condition about the sum of the base-2 logarithms of the roots into an equation involving the roots. </prompt_2.1>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
log₂(α) + log₂(β) + log₂(γ) = 5.

Using logarithm properties, this is equivalent to:

log₂(αβγ) = 5.

Which means:

αβγ = 2⁵ = 32.

But from Vieta's formula, we have αβγ = -a/8. Therefore:

-a/8 = 32 ⇒ -a = 32 * 8 ⇒ -a = 256 ⇒ a = -256.

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Wait, is that it? That seems straightforward, but let me check if there are any missing conditions or if I made a mistake in applying Vieta's formulas.

<prompt_3.1> Verify the solution by checking if all conditions are satisfied and if there are no contradictions. </prompt_3.1>

But hold on, the problem states that the equation has three distinct positive roots. So, we need to ensure that such a polynomial exists with these properties.

<prompt_3.2> Ensure the existence of three distinct positive roots for the polynomial with the derived values of a and b. </prompt_3.2>

But let me verify again. Let's retrace the steps.

<prompt_3.3> Retrace the steps to verify the solution derived from Vieta's formulas and the logarithm condition. </prompt_3.3>

However, just to be thorough, maybe we can check if the polynomial with a = -256 and some b would indeed have three distinct positive roots. Let's try to see.

<prompt_3.4> Consider the polynomial with a = -256 and determine if it can have three distinct positive roots. </prompt_3.4>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
First, let's confirm the logarithm step. The sum of logs is the log of the product, so log₂(α) + log₂(β) + log₂(γ) = log₂(αβγ) = 5. Therefore, αβγ = 2⁵ = 32. Correct.

From Vieta's, αβγ = -a/8. So, setting that equal to 32 gives -a/8 = 32 ⇒ -a = 256 ⇒ a = -256.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
Because if we just solve for a using the logarithm condition, we get a = -256. Then, we need to check if with a = -256, there exists a value of b such that the cubic equation has three distinct positive roots.

So, let's see. Let's substitute a = -256 into the original equation. Then the equation becomes:

8x³ + 4*(-256)x² + 2b x + (-256) = 0

Simplify:

8x³ - 1024x² + 2b x - 256 = 0.

We need to find b such that this equation has three distinct positive roots. But how can we ensure that? Maybe by checking the discriminant of the cubic equation. The discriminant of a cubic equation ax³ + bx² + cx + d = 0 is given by Δ = 18abcd - 4b³d + b²c² - 4ac³ - 27a²d². If Δ > 0, then the equation has three distinct real roots. Since we need three distinct positive roots, we also need to ensure that all roots are positive, which we already have from Vieta's (since their sum is positive, sum of products is positive, and product is positive). But maybe the discriminant is a bit involved here. Alternatively, we can use the derivative to check for the number of real roots.

Let's compute the derivative of the cubic:

f(x) = 8x³ - 1024x² + 2b x - 256

f'(x) = 24x² - 2048x + 2b.

For the cubic to have three distinct real roots, the derivative must have two distinct real critical points (i.e., the quadratic f'(x) must have a positive discriminant), and the function must have opposite signs at these critical points (i.e., the cubic has a local maximum and minimum, and the y-values of these extrema have opposite signs, ensuring a crossing from positive to negative and vice versa, thus three real roots).

First, let's check the discriminant of f'(x):

Discriminant D = (−2048)² − 4*24*2b.

Compute D:

D = 2048² - 192b.

For f'(x) to have two distinct real roots, D > 0:

2048² - 192b > 0 ⇒ 192b < 2048² ⇒ b < 2048² / 192.

Compute 2048²: 2048 is 2^11, so 2048² = 2^22. 2^22 / 192 = 2^22 / (2^6 * 3) ) = 2^(22-6) / 3 = 2^16 / 3 = 65536 / 3 ≈ 21845.333... So, b < approximately 21845.333.

But from earlier, we have b > 0 because sum of products two at a time is b/4, which must be positive. So, b must be in (0, 21845.333... ). But we don't know the exact value of b. However, since we have three distinct positive roots, such a b must exist. Therefore, as long as the discriminant of the cubic is positive, which would require certain conditions on a and b. However, calculating the discriminant might be complicated here.

Alternatively, since we already have a = -256 from the logarithm condition, and we know that the product of the roots is 32, which is positive, and the sum is -a/2 = 128, which is positive, and the sum of products is b/4. So, as long as b is positive, which it must be, then perhaps such a cubic can exist. But maybe there's a specific value of b that allows three distinct positive roots. However, since the problem only asks for a, and we derived a uniquely from the logarithm condition, combined with Vieta's formulas, then a must be -256. The existence of such a b ensuring three distinct positive roots is possible, but perhaps not necessary to compute here.
</execution_3.2>

<execution_3.3>
The sum of the logs is log₂(α) + log₂(β) + log₂(γ) = log₂(αβγ) = 5 ⇒ αβγ = 2⁵ = 32. From Vieta's, αβγ = -a/8. So, setting -a/8 = 32 gives a = -256. That seems correct. But let's check if this value of a is consistent with the other conditions.

But wait, we also need to make sure that the polynomial has three distinct positive roots. Just because Vieta's gives us the product and the sum, we need to confirm that such roots exist. Maybe we need to check the discriminant of the cubic? The discriminant of a cubic equation ax³ + bx² + cx + d = 0 is given by Δ = 18abcd - 4b³d + b²c² - 4ac³ - 27a²d². If Δ > 0, then the equation has three distinct real roots. Since we need three distinct positive roots, the discriminant must be positive, and also the roots must be positive. But calculating the discriminant might be complicated here.
</execution_3.3>

<execution_3.4>
Given a = -256, then from Vieta's formulas:

Sum of roots: α + β + γ = -a/2 = -(-256)/2 = 256/2 = 128.

Product of roots: αβγ = 32.

Sum of products two at a time: αβ + αγ + βγ = b/4 ⇒ b = 4(αβ + αγ + βγ).

But we don't know the individual roots, so we can't compute b directly. However, the problem doesn't mention anything about b, other than the existence of such roots. So, as long as there exists some b such that the cubic equation has three distinct positive roots with the given product and sum, then a = -256 is valid.

But is there a possible issue here? For example, can a cubic equation with sum of roots 128, product 32, and sum of products some b, have three distinct positive roots?

Alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that for a cubic to have three distinct real roots, its discriminant must be positive. The discriminant of a cubic equation ax³ + bx² + cx + d = 0 is given by Δ = 18abcd - 4b³d + b²c² - 4ac³ - 27a²d².

Wait, but in our case, the equation is 8x³ + 4a x² + 2b x + a = 0. Let's compute the discriminant for this specific equation.

But calculating the discriminant might be complicated, but perhaps we can check if with a = -256, whether the discriminant is positive. However, since we don't know the value of b, this might not be straightforward. Alternatively, maybe there's another approach.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the AM ≥ GM inequality since all roots are positive. The arithmetic mean of the roots is (α + β + γ)/3 = 128/3 ≈ 42.67, and the geometric mean is (αβγ)^(1/3) = 32^(1/3) = 3.1748. Since AM > GM, which is consistent with the roots being distinct. But AM > GM is always true for positive real numbers, whether distinct or not. So that doesn't necessarily ensure distinctness. However, the problem states that the roots are distinct, so we need to ensure that the polynomial actually allows for such a case.

Alternatively, maybe we can consider the derivative of the cubic to check for the number of real roots. If the cubic has three distinct real roots, then its derivative must have two distinct real roots (critical points), and the function must have a local maximum and minimum with opposite signs.

Let's try that. Let's compute the derivative of the cubic:

f(x) = 8x³ + 4a x² + 2b x + a.

f'(x) = 24x² + 8a x + 2b.

For the derivative to have two distinct real roots, the discriminant must be positive. The discriminant D of f'(x) is (8a)^2 - 4*24*2b = 64a² - 192b.

So, D = 64a² - 192b > 0 ⇒ 64a² > 192b ⇒ a² > 3b.

Given that a = -256, so a² = (-256)^2 = 65536. Then, 65536 > 3b ⇒ b < 65536 / 3 ≈ 21845.333...

But from Vieta's formula, we have b = 4(αβ + αγ + βγ). Since α, β, γ are positive, their sum of products is positive, so b is positive. So, as long as b is less than approximately 21845.333, the derivative will have two distinct real roots. However, since the problem states that the original cubic has three distinct positive roots, such a b must exist. Therefore, as long as the discriminant of the original cubic is positive, which would require certain conditions on the coefficients.

But calculating the discriminant of the original cubic might be a bit involved, but let's attempt it.

The discriminant Δ of the cubic equation 8x³ + 4a x² + 2b x + a = 0 is given by:

Δ = 18*8*4a*2b*a - 4*(4a)^3*a + (4a)^2*(2b)^2 - 4*8*(2b)^3 - 27*(8)^2*a^2.

Wait, that seems very complicated. Let me recall the general formula for the discriminant of a cubic equation ax³ + bx² + cx + d = 0:

Δ = 18abcd - 4b³d + b²c² - 4ac³ - 27a²d².

So, in our case, the coefficients are:

a_coeff = 8,

b_coeff = 4a,

c_coeff = 2b,

d_coeff = a.

Therefore, substituting into the discriminant formula:

Δ = 18 * 8 * 4a * 2b * a

- 4 * (4a)^3 * a

+ (4a)^2 * (2b)^2

- 4 * 8 * (2b)^3

- 27 * (8)^2 * (a)^2.

Let me compute each term step by step.

Based on execution_3.4:
First term: 18 * 8 * 4a * 2b * a

= 18 * 8 * 4 * 2 * a * a * b

= 18 * 8 * 8 * a²b

= 18 * 64 * a²b

= 1152 * a²b.
