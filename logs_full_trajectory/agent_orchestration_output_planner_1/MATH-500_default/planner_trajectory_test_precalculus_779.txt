Okay, so I need to figure out what happens when I rotate the complex number 7 + 2i by 90 degrees counter-clockwise around the origin. Hmm, let me recall. I remember that rotations in the complex plane can be done by multiplying by complex numbers. Specifically, a 90-degree rotation should correspond to multiplying by i, right? Because multiplying by i rotates a complex number 90 degrees counter-clockwise. Let me verify that.

First, let's think about what a complex number represents.
A complex number like 7 + 2i can be plotted as a point in the plane, where 7 is the real part (x-axis) and 2 is the imaginary part (y-axis). Rotating this point 90 degrees counter-clockwise around the origin should move it to a new position.

<prompt_1.1> Visualize the complex number 7 + 2i and determine the effect of a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation. </prompt_1.1>

Wait, how does that work exactly? Let me think about the rotation formula.

In general, a rotation by an angle θ in the complex plane can be achieved by multiplying the complex number z = a + bi by e^(iθ), which is cosθ + i sinθ. So for a 90-degree rotation, θ is 90 degrees, which is π/2 radians.

<execution_1.1>
If I imagine the coordinate plane, rotating 90 degrees counter-clockwise would move the point from (7, 2) to (-2, 7). Wait, is that right? Let me check. 

If you have a point (x, y) and rotate it 90 degrees counter-clockwise, the new coordinates become (-y, x). So applying that to (7, 2), we get (-2, 7). So the real part becomes -2 and the imaginary part becomes 7. Therefore, the resulting complex number would be -2 + 7i.

<execution_1.2>
So e^(iπ/2) = cos(π/2) + i sin(π/2) = 0 + i*1 = i. So multiplying by i gives the 90-degree rotation. That checks out. So, if I take the complex number 7 + 2i and multiply it by i, I should get the rotated point.

Based on execution_1.1:
But let me do the multiplication step by step to make sure I didn't just rely on the formula and instead understand why that happens.

Based on execution_1.2:
Wait, but let me make sure there's no mix-up between clockwise and counter-clockwise. Because sometimes when you rotate the coordinate system versus rotating the point, the direction can get confusing. But in this case, the problem specifies a counter-clockwise rotation around the origin, so the standard mathematical convention.

<prompt_2.2> Confirm the direction of rotation and its effect on the complex number. </prompt_2.2>

Alternatively, if I use the rotation formula for complex numbers. If I have a complex number z = a + bi, then rotating it by θ degrees gives z' = (a + bi)(cosθ + i sinθ). For θ = 90°, cosθ = 0 and sinθ = 1, so it's (a + bi)(0 + i) = i(a + bi) = ai + bi² = ai - b, which is -b + ai.

<prompt_2.3> Use the rotation formula to confirm the result of the rotation. </prompt_2.3>

Another way to think about this is using vectors. The complex number 7 + 2i can be represented as a vector [7, 2]. A 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation matrix is [ [0, -1], [1, 0] ]. Multiplying this matrix by the vector [7, 2] gives [0*7 + (-1)*2, 1*7 + 0*2] = [-2, 7], which corresponds to the complex number -2 + 7i.

<prompt_2.4> Use a rotation matrix to confirm the result of the rotation. </prompt_2.4>

Alternatively, if I use the exponential form. Let's represent 7 + 2i in polar form. The magnitude is sqrt(7² + 2²) = sqrt(49 + 4) = sqrt(53). The angle φ is arctan(2/7). Then, a 90-degree rotation would add π/2 to the angle. So the new angle is φ + π/2. Converting back to rectangular form: sqrt(53) [cos(φ + π/2) + i sin(φ + π/2)]. Using cosine addition formula: cosφ cos(π/2) - sinφ sin(π/2) = -sinφ, and sine addition formula: sinφ cos(π/2) + cosφ sin(π/2) = cosφ. Therefore, the real part is -sinφ * sqrt(53) and the imaginary part is cosφ * sqrt(53).

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
i*(7 + 2i) = 7i + 2i². But i² is -1, so this becomes 7i + 2*(-1) = -2 + 7i.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
So multiplying by i should indeed give a counter-clockwise rotation. Let me confirm with a simple example. Take the point 1 + 0i. Rotating 90 degrees counter-clockwise should take it to 0 + 1i. Multiplying 1 + 0i by i gives i, which is correct. Similarly, rotating i (which is 0 + 1i) by 90 degrees counter-clockwise should take it to -1 + 0i. Multiplying i by i gives i² = -1, which is correct.
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
So for z = 7 + 2i, this becomes -2 + 7i. Exactly the same result as before. So that confirms it. Therefore, the answer should be -2 + 7i.
</execution_2.3>

<execution_2.4>
So both methods confirm that the result is -2 + 7i. Therefore, I think that's the correct answer.
</execution_2.4>

<execution_2.5>
But sinφ is 2/sqrt(53) and cosφ is 7/sqrt(53). Therefore, real part is - (2/sqrt(53)) * sqrt(53) = -2, and imaginary part is (7/sqrt(53)) * sqrt(53) = 7. So again, -2 + 7i.

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
But just to be thorough, let me consider another example.
If I take 1 + 0i and rotate it 90 degrees, I get 0 + 1i, which is i. If I take 0 + 1i and rotate it 90 degrees counter-clockwise, I should get -1 + 0i. Let's see: multiplying 0 + 1i by i gives i² = -1, which is correct.

Another example: take 3 + 4i. Rotating 90 degrees counter-clockwise should give -4 + 3i. Let's check by multiplying: i*(3 + 4i) = 3i + 4i² = 3i -4 = -4 + 3i.
