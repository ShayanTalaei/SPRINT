\[f(x) - f(a) = (x - a)^2 (x - b).\]Enter the ordered pair $(a,b).$

<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to find real numbers a and b, where a isn't zero, such that when I subtract f(a) from f(x), the result is equal to (x - a)² times (x - b). The function f(x) is given as x³ + 3x² + 1. Hmm, let me try to unpack this step by step.

<prompt_1.1> Expand both sides of the equation \(f(x) - f(a) = (x - a)^2 (x - b)\) and compare the coefficients to find \(a\) and \(b\). </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
First, let's write down what f(x) - f(a) looks like. Since f(x) is a cubic polynomial, subtracting f(a) from it will still give a cubic polynomial, but the constant term will be adjusted. Let me compute f(x) - f(a):

f(x) - f(a) = (x³ + 3x² + 1) - (a³ + 3a² + 1) = x³ + 3x² - a³ - 3a².

So, f(x) - f(a) simplifies to x³ + 3x² - a³ - 3a².

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
On the other hand, the right-hand side of the equation is (x - a)² times (x - b). Let me expand that.

First, (x - a)² is x² - 2ax + a². Then, multiplying this by (x - b) gives:

(x² - 2ax + a²)(x - b) = x³ - b x² - 2a x² + 2ab x + a² x - a² b.

Combining like terms, this becomes:

x³ + (-b - 2a)x² + (2ab + a²)x - a² b.

So, expanding both sides, we have:

Left side (f(x) - f(a)): x³ + 3x² - (a³ + 3a²).

Right side ( (x - a)² (x - b) ): x³ + (-b - 2a)x² + (2ab + a²)x - a² b.

Since these two polynomials are equal for all x, their corresponding coefficients must be equal. Let's set up equations by equating the coefficients of each power of x.

<prompt_2.1> Equate the coefficients of the expanded polynomials from both sides to form a system of equations. </prompt_2.1>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Starting with the x³ term: Both sides have 1 as the coefficient, so that's already satisfied.

Next, the x² term: On the left side, it's 3. On the right side, it's (-b - 2a). Therefore:

3 = -b - 2a.  [Equation 1]

Then, the x term: On the left side, there's no x term, so the coefficient is 0. On the right side, the coefficient is (2ab + a²). Therefore:

0 = 2ab + a².  [Equation 2]

Finally, the constant term: On the left side, after simplifying f(x) - f(a), the constant term is - (a³ + 3a²). On the right side, the constant term is -a² b. Therefore:

- (a³ + 3a²) = -a² b.  [Equation 3]

So now we have three equations:

1. 3 = -b - 2a
2. 0 = 2ab + a²
3. - (a³ + 3a²) = -a² b

Our variables are a and b. Let's try to solve this system.

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Starting with Equation 2: 0 = 2ab + a². Let's factor this:

a(2b + a) = 0.

Since the problem states that a ≠ 0, we can divide both sides by a:

2b + a = 0 => b = -a/2.

So, b is expressed in terms of a: b = -a/2.

Let's substitute this into Equation 1: 3 = -b - 2a.

<prompt_3.1> Substitute \(b = -a/2\) into Equation 1 and solve for \(a\). </prompt_3.1>
-----

Now, let's check if this works with Equation 3. Let's compute left and right sides.

<prompt_3.2> Verify the solution using Equation 3 by computing both sides with the found values of \(a\) and \(b\). </prompt_3.2>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
Substituting b = -a/2 into Equation 1:

3 = -(-a/2) - 2a = (a/2) - 2a = (a/2 - 4a/2) = (-3a/2).

Therefore:

3 = -3a/2 => Multiply both sides by 2: 6 = -3a => a = -2.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
Left side: - (a³ + 3a²).

Right side: -a² b = -a²*(-a/2) = a³/2.

So, according to Equation 3:

- (a³ + 3a²) = a³/2.

Let's substitute a = -3:

Left side: - [ (-3)^3 + 3*(-3)^2 ] = - [ -27 + 3*9 ] = - [ -27 + 27 ] = - [0] = 0.

Right side: (-3)^3 / 2 = -27 / 2. Wait, but according to the equation, 0 = -27/2? That's not true. Hmm, that's a problem. Did I make a mistake here?

Wait, no. Wait, if a = -3, then according to Equation 3:

Left side: - (a³ + 3a²) = - [ (-3)^3 + 3*(-3)^2 ] = - [ -27 + 3*9 ] = - [ -27 + 27 ] = - [0] = 0.

Right side: -a² b = - (-3)^2 * ( - (-3)/2 ). Wait, let's compute b when a = -3. Since b = -a/2, then b = -(-3)/2 = 3/2. So, right side is -a² b = - (9) * (3/2) = -27/2. But left side is 0. So 0 = -27/2? That's not possible. There's a contradiction here.

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
Let's check if this satisfies Equation 3 as well.

First, compute left side: - (a³ + 3a²) = - [ (-2)^3 + 3*(-2)^2 ] = - [ -8 + 3*4 ] = - [ -8 + 12 ] = - [4] = -4.

<prompt_4.1> Verify the solution by substituting \(a = -2\) and \(b = 1\) back into the original equation \(f(x) - f(a) = (x - a)^2 (x - b)\). </prompt_4.1>

Based on execution_3.2:
Wait, this suggests that there's an error in my reasoning. Let me check where I messed up.

<prompt_4.2> Identify and correct the error in the reasoning using Equation 3. </prompt_4.2>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
Now, compute right side: -a² b = - [ (-2)^2 * 1 ] = - [4 * 1] = -4. So, yes, -4 = -4.
</execution_4.1>

<execution_4.2>
Wait, let's go back to Equation 3. The original equation is:

- (a³ + 3a²) = -a² b.

Multiply both sides by -1:

a³ + 3a² = a² b.

Then, if we substitute b = -a/2, we have:

a³ + 3a² = a²*(-a/2) => a³ + 3a² = -a³/2.

Bring all terms to one side:

a³ + 3a² + a³/2 = 0 => (3a³/2) + 3a² = 0.

Factor out 3a²:

3a²( a/2 + 1 ) = 0.

Since a ≠ 0, we have a/2 + 1 = 0 => a = -2.
</execution_4.2>
</Execution_4>

<Plan_5>
Based on execution_4.2:
So, this suggests that a = -2 is the solution. Then, b = -a/2 = -(-2)/2 = 1.

So, the ordered pair is (-2, 1). Let's verify this.

<prompt_5.1> Verify the solution using the corrected approach with \(a = -2\) and \(b = 1\). </prompt_5.1>
</Plan_5>

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
First, compute f(x) - f(-2):

f(x) = x³ + 3x² +1.

f(-2) = (-2)^3 + 3*(-2)^2 +1 = -8 + 12 +1 = 5.

Therefore, f(x) - f(-2) = x³ + 3x² +1 -5 = x³ + 3x² -4.

Now, compute (x - (-2))² (x -1) = (x +2)^2 (x -1).

First, expand (x +2)^2 = x² +4x +4.

Multiply by (x -1):

(x² +4x +4)(x -1) = x³ -x² +4x² -4x +4x -4 = x³ +3x² -4.

Which matches f(x) - f(-2) = x³ +3x² -4. So, yes, it works.

Wait, so why did Equation 3 seem to give a problem earlier? Because when I substituted a = -3, but actually, the correct value is a = -2. So, my initial mistake was in solving Equation 3. Let me see:

From Equation 3:

- (a³ + 3a²) = -a² b.

But since b = -a/2, substitute:

Left side: - (a³ + 3a²).

Right side: -a²*(-a/2) = (a³)/2.

So, equate:

- (a³ + 3a²) = (a³)/2.

Multiply both sides by 2:

-2a³ -6a² = a³.

Bring all terms to left:

-2a³ -6a² -a³ = 0 => -3a³ -6a² = 0 => -3a²(a + 2) = 0.

Thus, a = 0 or a = -2. Since a ≠ 0, a = -2. So that's correct. So earlier, when I thought a = -3, that was a miscalculation. The correct value is a = -2.

Based on execution_5.1:
Therefore, the ordered pair is (-2, 1).

Let me just verify once more.

Compute f(x) - f(-2):

f(x) = x³ +3x² +1. f(-2) = (-8) + 12 +1 =5. So f(x)-5 =x³ +3x² -4.

Compute (x - (-2))² (x -1) = (x+2)^2 (x -1). Expand:

(x² +4x +4)(x -1) =x³ -x² +4x² -4x +4x -4 =x³ +3x² -4. Which matches.

Therefore, the ordered pair is (-2,1).

Therefore, the ordered pair $(a,b)$ is $\boxed{(-2,1)}$.
