Okay, so I need to solve the equation (x/2) + (x/3) = 5. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. Alright, first, I remember that when you have variables in equations with fractions, a good strategy might be to eliminate the denominators by finding a common denominator or multiplying both sides by the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators. Let me try that.

The denominators here are 2 and 3. The LCM of 2 and 3 is 6, right? So if I multiply both sides of the equation by 6, that should eliminate the fractions. Let me write that down:
6 * (x/2 + x/3) = 6 * 5

<prompt_1.1> Multiply both sides of the equation by 6 to eliminate the fractions as per the above plan. </prompt_1.1>

Distributing the 6 on the left side, I get:
6*(x/2) + 6*(x/3) = 30

Calculating each term:
6 divided by 2 is 3, so 3x
6 divided by 3 is 2, so 2x
</execution_1.1>
</Execution_1>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
So the equation simplifies to:
3x + 2x = 30

Combining like terms:
5x = 30

Then dividing both sides by 5:
x = 30 / 5
x = 6

Let me check if that makes sense. Plugging x = 6 back into the original equation:
6/2 + 6/3 = 3 + 2 = 5

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the steps. Let me go through each step again.

Is there another way to solve this equation? Maybe by finding a common denominator first? Let's try that method to confirm.

Alternatively, I could solve it using algebraic manipulation without multiplying by 6. Let's see.

Starting with the original equation: (x/2) + (x/3) = 5. To combine these two terms, I need a common denominator. The denominators are 2 and 3, so the LCD is 6. So, converting each fraction:
x/2 = 3x/6
x/3 = 2x/6
Adding them together gives (3x + 2x)/6 = 5x/6. Wait, but the original equation is equal to 5, not 5x/6. Hmm, so maybe my first step was correct, but let me check again. Wait, no, if I add x/2 and x/3, converting to sixths:
x/2 = 3x/6
x/3 = 2x/6
So adding them: 3x/6 + 2x/6 = (3x + 2x)/6 = 5x/6. But the equation says that this sum equals 5. So 5x/6 = 5.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
The denominators are 2 and 3. The common denominator is 6. So rewriting the equation:

( x/2 + x/3 ) = 5

Convert each fraction:

x/2 = (3x)/6

x/3 = (2x)/6

Adding them together: (3x + 2x)/6 = 5

Which simplifies to 5x/6 = 5

Then multiply both sides by 6:

5x = 30

Divide by 5:

x = 6
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
Starting with (x/2) + (x/3) = 5. To combine the fractions, I need a common denominator. The denominators are 2 and 3, so the common denominator is 6. So, converting each fraction:

(x/2) = (3x)/6

(x/3) = (2x)/6

So the equation becomes:
(3x)/6 + (2x)/6 = 5

Combine the terms:
(3x + 2x)/6 = 5

Which simplifies to:
5x/6 = 5

Then multiply both sides by 6:
5x = 30

Divide by 5:
x = 6
</execution_2.3>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Then multiply both sides by 6 to eliminate the denominator:
6*(5x/6) = 6*5
Which simplifies to 5x = 30. Then divide by 5. Same result.

Based on execution_2.2, execution_2.3:
Another check: if x=6, then 6 divided by 2 is 3, and 6 divided by 3 is 2.

Adding them gives 5. Correct. So all methods lead to x=6, and plugging back in works. Therefore, I think that's the correct solution. I don't see any mistakes in the steps. Maybe I should consider if there's any alternative interpretation of the equation, but as written, it's a linear equation with a single variable, so the solution should be unique. No quadratic terms or absolute values to deal with, so straightforward.

<Final_answer>
Therefore, the solution to the equation $\frac{x}{2} + \frac{x}{3} = 5$ is $x = \boxed{6}$.
