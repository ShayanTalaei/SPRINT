Okay, so I need to find the value of y such that when I project the vector (2, y, -5) onto the vector (1, -2, 1), the result is (5/6)(1, -2, 1). Hmm, let me recall how vector projections work. 

First, the formula for the projection of a vector **v** onto another vector **u** is given by ( (**v** ⋅ **u**) / ||**u**||² ) **u**. Right? So in this case, **v** is the vector (2, y, -5) and **u** is (1, -2, 1). The projection should equal (5/6)(1, -2, 1). So if I compute the projection using the formula and set it equal to that vector, I can solve for y.

Let me compute the dot product first. **v** ⋅ **u** = (2)(1) + (y)(-2) + (-5)(1) = 2 - 2y - 5. That simplifies to (2 - 5) - 2y = -3 - 2y. Okay, so the dot product is -3 - 2y.

Next, I need the magnitude squared of **u**.
Since **u** is (1, -2, 1), its magnitude squared is 1² + (-2)² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. Got that. So ||**u**||² = 6.

Therefore, the projection of **v** onto **u** is ( (-3 - 2y) / 6 ) times the vector (1, -2, 1). According to the problem, this should equal (5/6)(1, -2, 1). So setting them equal:

[ (-3 - 2y) / 6 ] * (1, -2, 1) = (5/6)(1, -2, 1)

Since the scalar multipliers must be equal, the scalar (-3 - 2y)/6 must equal 5/6. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

(-3 - 2y)/6 = 5/6

<prompt_1.1> Solve the equation \((-3 - 2y)/6 = 5/6\) to find the value of \(y\). </prompt_1.1>

Multiply both sides by 6 to eliminate the denominator:

-3 - 2y = 5

Then, add 3 to both sides:

-2y = 5 + 3

-2y = 8

Divide both sides by -2:

y = 8 / (-2) = -4

Based on execution_1.1:
Wait, let me check if that's correct. Let me substitute y = -4 back into the original vector and compute the projection again to verify.

<prompt_2.1> Verify the solution by substituting \(y = -4\) back into the original vector and computing the projection. </prompt_2.1>

Wait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let's go through the calculation again.

<prompt_2.2> Re-evaluate the solution by going through the calculation again to ensure no mistakes were made. </prompt_2.2>

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this problem? Let's see. The projection being (5/6)**u** implies that the projection is a scalar multiple of **u**, which makes sense because that's how vector projection works. The projection's magnitude is 5/6 times the magnitude of **u**.

<execution_2.1>
The original vector is (2, -4, -5). Compute the dot product with **u**: 2*1 + (-4)*(-2) + (-5)*1 = 2 + 8 - 5 = 5. Then, divide by 6 and multiply by **u**: (5/6)(1, -2, 1). That's exactly what was given. So yes, y = -4 is correct.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Dot product of (2, y, -5) and (1, -2, 1) is 2*1 + y*(-2) + (-5)*1 = 2 - 2y -5 = -3 -2y. Correct. 

Magnitude squared of **u** is 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. Correct. 

So the projection scalar is (-3 -2y)/6. Setting that equal to 5/6 gives -3 -2y = 5. Then solving: -2y = 5 + 3 => -2y = 8 => y = -4.
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
But maybe that's complicating things. Let's stick with the standard projection formula.

Another way to check is to compute the projection with y = -4 and see if it indeed gives (5/6)(1, -2, 1).

So, with y = -4, the vector **v** is (2, -4, -5). The dot product with **u** is 2*1 + (-4)*(-2) + (-5)*1 = 2 + 8 -5 = 5. The magnitude squared of **u** is 6, so the projection is (5/6)**u**, which matches the given projection.

<Final_answer>
Therefore, the value of $y$ is $\boxed{-4}$.
