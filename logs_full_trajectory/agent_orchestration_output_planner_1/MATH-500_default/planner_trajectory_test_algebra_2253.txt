<Question>
The operation $\&$ is defined for positive integers $a$ and $b$ as $a \& b = \displaystyle\frac{\sqrt{a b + a}}{\sqrt{a b - b}}$. What is the value of $9 \& 2$? Express your answer as a common fraction in simplest radical form.

Okay, let's see. I need to find the value of 9 & 2 using the operation defined as a & b = (√(ab + a)) / (√(ab - b)). Hmm, first, I should make sure I understand the operation correctly. So, for any positive integers a and b, the operation & takes them and computes the square root of (ab + a) divided by the square root of (ab - b). 

Alright, so plugging in 9 for a and 2 for b. Let me write that out step by step. First, compute ab + a and ab - b. Let's calculate the numerator and denominator separately inside the square roots.

Starting with the numerator part: ab + a.
Since a is 9 and b is 2, that would be 9*2 + 9. Let me compute that.
9*2 is 18, and 18 + 9 is 27. So the numerator inside the square root is 27.

Now the denominator part: ab - b.
Again, a is 9 and b is 2, so that's 9*2 - 2.

<prompt_1.1> Calculate the denominator part ab - b for the operation 9 & 2. </prompt_1.1>

Wait, but maybe I can simplify sqrt(27) and sqrt(14) further? Let's check.

<prompt_1.2> Check if the square roots in the expression can be simplified further. </prompt_1.2>

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to approach the problem before plugging in the numbers? Let me see if I can simplify the expression a & b algebraically first, then plug in a=9 and b=2. Maybe that would lead to a different but equivalent expression, which might be easier to compute.

Starting with the original expression:

Let me compute that. 9*2 is 18, and 18 - 2 is 16. So the denominator inside the square root is 16.

So now, the operation 9 & 2 becomes √27 divided by √16.
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
sqrt(27) is equal to sqrt(9*3) which is 3*sqrt(3). And sqrt(14) is already a prime number, so it can't be simplified further. So sqrt(27)/sqrt(14) becomes 3*sqrt(3)/sqrt(14). But usually, we rationalize the denominator. So 3*sqrt(3)/sqrt(14) multiplied by sqrt(14)/sqrt(14) gives 3*sqrt(42)/14.

<execution_1.3>
a & b = √(ab + a) / √(ab - b)

Factor out common terms in the numerator and denominator. In the numerator, ab + a = a(b + 1). In the denominator, ab - b = b(a - 1). So:

√[a(b + 1)] / √[b(a - 1)]

This can be written as:

√[a(b + 1)] / √[b(a - 1)] = √[ (a(b + 1)) / (b(a - 1)) ) ]

Because √x / √y = √(x/y). So combining the two square roots into one:

√[ (a(b + 1)) / (b(a - 1)) ) ]

Maybe simplify the fraction inside the square root:

(a(b + 1)) / (b(a - 1)) = [a/b * (b + 1)/(a - 1)]

But perhaps substituting a=9 and b=2 into this simplified expression would be easier.

Let's try that.

Based on execution_1.1:
Let me simplify those square roots if possible. 

I know that sqrt(16) is 4, since 4*4=16. But sqrt(27) can be simplified because 27 is 9*3, and 9 is a perfect square.

<prompt_2.1> Simplify the expression √27 / √16 to find the result of 9 & 2. </prompt_2.1>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
So sqrt(27) = sqrt(9*3) = sqrt(9)*sqrt(3) = 3*sqrt(3). So sqrt(27) is 3√3, and sqrt(16) is 4. Therefore, the expression becomes (3√3) / 4.

Based on execution_2.1:
Wait, but the problem says to express the answer as a common fraction in simplest radical form. So 3√3 over 4 is already a common fraction, and the radical is simplified.
So that should be the answer.

But let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, compute ab + a when a=9 and b=2: 9*2 + 9 = 18 + 9 = 27. Correct.
Then ab - b: 9*2 - 2 = 18 - 2 = 16.

<prompt_3.1> Verify the steps taken to compute 9 & 2 and ensure the answer is correct. </prompt_3.1>

Alternatively, maybe I can check if there's a different way to approach the problem that might lead to a different form, but I think this is as simplified as it gets.
Since 3 and 4 are coprime, and 3 is a prime number, so the fraction 3/4 is in simplest terms, and the radical √3 is already simplified. So there's no further simplification needed.

Therefore, the value of 9 & 2 is 3√3 over 4.

Wait, but let me confirm once more. Let's substitute a=9 and b=2 into the original expression:

<prompt_3.2> Reconfirm the solution by substituting a=9 and b=2 into the original expression. </prompt_3.2>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
Taking the square roots gives sqrt(27) and sqrt(16), which are 3√3 and 4. So dividing them gives 3√3 / 4. That seems right.

Is there any step where I might have made an error? Let me check again.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
√(9*2 + 9) / √(9*2 - 2) = √(18 + 9)/√(18 - 2) = √27 / √16 = 3√3 / 4.
</execution_3.2>
</Execution_3>

<Final_answer>
Therefore, the value of $9 \& 2$ is $\boxed{\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{4}}$.
