Okay, so Remmy needs to divide 10 by 2/3, but he's forget how to do that. Hmm, let me think. I remember that dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. But wait, what exactly is a reciprocal? Let me recall. A reciprocal of a number is 1 divided by that number, right? So, for example, the reciprocal of 5 is 1/5, and the reciprocal of 2/3 would be 3/2. So, if you have a fraction, flipping it gives you its reciprocal. Got it.

So, applying that to this problem, dividing 10 by 2/3 should be the same as multiplying 10 by 3/2. But the question is asking by what number Remmy should multiply 10 to get the answer. So, that number would be 3/2. Let me verify that.
If you divide 10 by 2/3, the steps would be: keep the first number (10) as it is, change the division sign to a multiplication sign, and then take the reciprocal of the second number (2/3 becomes 3/2). So, 10 multiplied by 3/2.

Let me compute that to check. 10 times 3 is 30, divided by 2 is 15. So, 10 divided by 2/3 is 15.

But wait, maybe I should explain this step-by-step for clarity. Let's break it down. When you divide by a fraction, you invert the fraction and multiply.

<prompt_1.1> Break down the division of 10 by 2/3 into a step-by-step process and verify the result. </prompt_1.1>

But let me make sure there isn't another way to approach this. Maybe using visual models or something.

<prompt_1.2> Explore alternative methods, such as using visual models, to understand why dividing by a fraction is equivalent to multiplying by its reciprocal. </prompt_1.2>

Alternatively, think of it as how many 2/3s are in 10. So, if you have 10 divided by 2/3, you're asking how many times 2/3 fits into 10. Since 2/3 is less than 1, it should fit more than 10 times.

<prompt_1.3> Use the concept of determining how many 2/3s fit into 10 to explain why dividing by a fraction results in a larger number. </prompt_1.3>

Another way to verify is to use the common denominator method. Let me try that.

<execution_1.1>
So, 10 ÷ (2/3) becomes 10 × (3/2). That makes sense because dividing by a number is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. So, the operation Remmy needs to perform is multiplying 10 by 3/2. Therefore, the number he should multiply by is 3/2.
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
For example, if you have 10 divided by 1/2, that's like asking how many halves are in 10, which is 20. And indeed, dividing by 1/2 is the same as multiplying by 2. So, the same rule applies here. So, in this case, dividing by 2/3 is multiplying by 3/2.
</execution_1.2>

<execution_1.3>
For example, 1 divided by 1/2 is 2 because you can fit two halves into one. Similarly, 10 divided by 2/3 should be more than 10. And 15 makes sense because 2/3 times 15 is 10. Let me check that. 15 multiplied by 2/3: 15 divided by 3 is 5, 5 times 2 is 10.
</execution_1.3>

<execution_1.4>
When you divide two fractions, you multiply both by the same number to get rid of the denominator. So, 10 divided by 2/3. Let's write 10 as 10/1. So, (10/1) ÷ (2/3). To eliminate the denominators, multiply numerator and denominator by 3. That gives (10/1 * 3/3) ÷ (2/3 * 3/3) = (30/3) ÷ (6/9). Wait, but that seems more complicated. Maybe another approach. If you have (10/1) ÷ (2/3), you can multiply numerator and denominator by 3 to get rid of the denominator fraction. So, multiplying numerator (10/1) by 3 gives 30/1, and denominator (2/3) multiplied by 3 gives 6/3, which simplifies to 2. So now, the problem becomes (30/1) ÷ 2, which is 15.

Based on execution_1.1:
To confirm, let's do the calculation step by step. 

Original problem: 10 ÷ (2/3).

<prompt_2.1> Re-evaluate the original problem 10 ÷ (2/3) and confirm the solution by breaking down the calculation. </prompt_2.1>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Convert division to multiplication by taking reciprocal: 10 × (3/2). 

Multiply 10 by 3/2: (10 × 3)/2 = 30/2 = 15.
</execution_2.1>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
So, the answer should be 15, and the number to multiply by is 3/2. 

But the question specifically asks: "By what number should he multiply 10 to get the answer"? So, the number is 3/2.
Therefore, the answer is 3/2. 

Wait, but maybe they want it as a fraction or a mixed number? 3/2 is already a fraction, so probably 3/2 is fine.
Alternatively, if they wanted it as a decimal, it would be 1.5, but since the original numbers were fractions, probably best to leave it as 3/2.

<Final_answer>
Therefore, Remmy should multiply $10$ by $\boxed{\frac{3}{2}}$ to get the answer.
