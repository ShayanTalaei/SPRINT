Okay, so I need to figure out how to divide two numbers in base 5 and express the quotient also in base 5. The problem is 413₅ divided by 2₅. Hmm, base conversions can be tricky, but let me take it step by step.

<prompt_1.1> Convert the numbers 413₅ and 2₅ to base 10 and set up the division problem in base 10. </prompt_1.1>

First, I remember that when dividing numbers in a different base, it might be easier to convert them to base 10, do the division there, and then convert the result back to base 5. Let me confirm if that's a valid approach. Yeah, because arithmetic operations are consistent across bases as long as we convert properly. So, let's try that.

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Starting with the dividend, which is 413 in base 5. To convert it to base 10, each digit represents a power of 5. The rightmost digit is 5⁰, then 5¹, 5², etc. So breaking down 413₅:

<prompt_2.1> Convert 413₅ to base 10 using the above plan. </prompt_2.1>

Now the divisor is 2 in base 5, which is the same as 2 in base 10. So the division problem in base 10 is 108 ÷ 2.
Let me compute that. 108 divided by 2 is 54. So the quotient in base 10 is 54.

Now I need to convert 54 back to base 5. To do this, I can use the division method where we divide the number by 5 and keep track of the remainders.

<prompt_2.2> Convert 54 from base 10 to base 5 using the above plan. </prompt_2.2>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
From right to left, the digits are 3, 1, 4. So:

3 × 5⁰ = 3 × 1 = 3  
1 × 5¹ = 1 × 5 = 5  
4 × 5² = 4 × 25 = 100  

Adding those up: 100 + 5 + 3 = 108. So 413₅ is 108 in base 10.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Let's see:

First, divide 54 by 5. 5 goes into 54 ten times with a remainder of 4. So the first digit (rightmost) is 4.

Then take the quotient, which is 10, and divide by 5 again. 5 goes into 10 twice with a remainder of 0. So the next digit is 0.

Take the quotient 2 and divide by 5. 5 goes into 2 zero times with a remainder of 2. So the next digit is 2.

Since the quotient is now 0, we stop. Writing the digits from last to first, the base 5 number is 2 0 4. So 204₅.

Wait, let me check that.

Based on execution_2.2:
204 in base 5. Let's convert that back to base 10 to verify:

<prompt_3.1> Verify the conversion from base 10 back to base 5 using the above plan. </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
2 × 5² = 2 × 25 = 50  
0 × 5¹ = 0 × 5 = 0  
4 × 5⁰ = 4 × 1 = 4  
Total: 50 + 0 + 4 = 54. Perfect, that's correct.

Therefore, the quotient is 204 in base 5.

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
But wait, let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a mistake in the base conversion. Let's try converting 413₅ to base 10 again:

<prompt_4.1> Re-verify the conversion of 413₅ to base 10 using the above plan. </prompt_4.1>

Divided by 2₅ which is 2 in base 10: 108 ÷ 2 = 54. Then converted 54 to base 5 as 204.
Divided into 413₅, which is 108, 108 ÷ 2 = 54, which is 204₅. Seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can try performing the division directly in base 5 without converting to base 10? Let me attempt that to cross-verify.

<prompt_4.2> Consider and plan to perform the division directly in base 5 using the above plan. </prompt_4.2>

<execution_4.1>
Digits: 4 (5²), 1 (5¹), 3 (5⁰).

Calculations:

4 * 25 = 100  
1 * 5 = 5  
3 * 1 = 3  
Total: 100 + 5 + 3 = 108.

<execution_4.2>
So, dividing 413₅ by 2₅. Let's write it out like long division in base 5.

First, set up the division: 2₅ ) 413₅

Starting from the leftmost digit of the dividend. The first digit is 4 (in base 5). Since we're dividing by 2 (base 5), which is 2 in base 10. How many times does 2 go into 4? In base 10 terms, 4 ÷ 2 = 2. But we need to express this in base 5. However, 2 in base 10 is the same as 2 in base 5. So the first digit of the quotient is 2.

Multiply 2 (base 5) by 2 (base 5): 2*2=4 in base 10, which is 4 in base 5. Subtract that from 4 (base 5), which gives 0. Bring down the next digit, which is 1.

Now, we have 0 (from the subtraction) and bring down the 1, making it 1 in base 5. Now, how many times does 2 (base 5) go into 1 (base 5)? In base 10, 2 (base 5) is 2, 1 (base 5) is 1. 1 ÷ 2 is 0 with a remainder of 1. So the next digit in the quotient is 0. Write down 0 and proceed.

Multiply 0 by 2, which is 0. Subtract that from 1, gives 1. Bring down the next digit, which is 3. Now we have 1 (from the previous remainder) and bring down 3, making it 13 in base 5. Wait, no. Wait, in base 5, when we bring down the next digit, it's 3 (base 5). So actually, after bringing down the 3, we have 1 (from the previous remainder) and 3 (current digit). But how is that combined?

Wait, maybe I need to think more carefully. When we bring down the next digit in long division, we're combining the remainder with the next digit. So after the first step, we had 4 divided by 2 gives 2, remainder 0. Bring down the 1, making it 01 in base 5. Then 2 goes into 1 zero times, remainder 1. Bring down the 3, making it 13 in base 5. Now, 2 goes into 13 (base 5) how many times?

First, convert 13 base 5 to base 10: 1*5 +3=8. So 8 divided by 2 is 4. But 4 in base 5 is 4. So 2 (base 5) goes into 13 (base 5) four times. Wait, but in base 5, 4 is a single digit. So we write 4 as the next digit in the quotient.

Multiply 4 (base 5) by 2 (base 5): 4*2=8 in base 10, which is 13 in base 5 (since 1*5 +3=8). Wait, 4*2 in base 5: 4*2=8, which is 1*5 +3, so 13 in base 5. So subtract 13 from 13 (in base 5), which gives 0. So the remainder is 0.

Therefore, the quotient is 2 0 4 in base 5, which is 204₅. That matches the previous result. So both methods give the same answer. Therefore, the quotient is indeed 204 in base 5.
