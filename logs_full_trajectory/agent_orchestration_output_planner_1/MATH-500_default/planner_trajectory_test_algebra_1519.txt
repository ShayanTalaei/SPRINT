Okay, so I need to simplify the expression 3 divided by the square root of 27. Let me think about how to approach this. First, I remember that simplifying radicals often involves breaking down the number under the square root into factors, especially perfect squares if possible. But 27 isn't a perfect square, so maybe I can factor it into a product that includes a perfect square.

Let me recall, 27 is 3 cubed, which is 3 times 3 times 3. Hmm, but that's not a perfect square. However, if I write 27 as 9 times 3, since 9 is a perfect square. So, sqrt(27) can be written as sqrt(9*3). Then, using the property that sqrt(a*b) = sqrt(a)*sqrt(b), this becomes sqrt(9)*sqrt(3). Since sqrt(9) is 3, that simplifies to 3*sqrt(3). So, sqrt(27) is 3*sqrt(3).

Based on execution_1.1:
Now, substituting that back into the original expression, we have 3 divided by 3*sqrt(3).
The 3 in the numerator and the 3 in the denominator can cancel out, right? So, 3 divided by 3 is 1, leaving us with 1 over sqrt(3).

But wait, I think it's considered improper to have a radical in the denominator. Maybe I need to rationalize the denominator. To do that, I can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by sqrt(3).

<prompt_2.1> Rationalize the denominator of the expression by multiplying the numerator and denominator by sqrt(3). </prompt_2.1>

Wait, but let me check if there's another way to approach this. Maybe simplifying the original expression differently. Instead of breaking down sqrt(27), perhaps I can write the entire fraction under a single square root.

<prompt_2.2> Explore an alternative method to simplify the expression by writing the entire fraction under a single square root. </prompt_2.2>

Alternatively, maybe I can simplify the fraction 3/sqrt(27) by expressing 3 as sqrt(9), since sqrt(9) is 3.

<prompt_2.3> Explore another alternative method by expressing 3 as sqrt(9) and simplifying. </prompt_2.3>

Wait a second, let me verify with decimal approximation to make sure. Let's compute the original expression and the simplified one numerically.

<prompt_2.4> Verify the simplified expression using decimal approximation for original and simplified expressions. </prompt_2.4>

Another way to check is to square the original expression and see if it matches the square of the simplified expression. Let's compute (3/sqrt(27))^2.

<prompt_2.5> Verify the simplified expression by squaring both the original and simplified expressions. </prompt_2.5>

<execution_2.1>
So, multiplying the numerator and denominator by sqrt(3), we get (1*sqrt(3))/(sqrt(3)*sqrt(3)). The denominator becomes sqrt(3)*sqrt(3) which is 3. So now, the expression is sqrt(3)/3.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Let's see, 3 divided by sqrt(27) can be written as sqrt(9)/sqrt(27), since 3 is sqrt(9). Then, combining the square roots into one fraction: sqrt(9/27). Simplifying 9/27, which reduces to 1/3. So, sqrt(1/3) is the same as sqrt(1)/sqrt(3), which is 1/sqrt(3). Again, same result as before. So, rationalizing the denominator gives sqrt(3)/3.
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
Then, the expression becomes sqrt(9)/sqrt(27). Using the property that sqrt(a)/sqrt(b) = sqrt(a/b), this becomes sqrt(9/27). Simplifying 9/27, which reduces to 1/3. So, sqrt(1/3) is the same as 1/sqrt(3), which again leads me to the same point of needing to rationalize the denominator.
</execution_2.3>

<execution_2.4>
Original: 3 / sqrt(27). Let's compute sqrt(27) first. sqrt(27) is approximately 5.196. Then 3 divided by 5.196 is approximately 0.577. Now, the simplified expression is sqrt(3)/3. sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, divided by 3 gives approximately 0.577. So they match.
</execution_2.4>

<execution_2.5>
That's 9/27, which is 1/3. The simplified expression is sqrt(3)/3, so squaring that gives (3)/9 = 1/3. So they both square to the same value, which suggests they are equal.
