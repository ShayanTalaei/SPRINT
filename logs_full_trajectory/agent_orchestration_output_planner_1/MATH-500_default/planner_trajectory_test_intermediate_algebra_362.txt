<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to find the sum of the distances from the four intersection points of these two graphs to the point (-3, 2). Hmm, let me start by understanding what the given equations represent.

<prompt_1.1> Identify the shapes represented by the given equations and plan to find their intersection points. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
The first equation is x² + y² + 6x - 24y + 72 = 0. That looks like a circle equation, but it's not in the standard form. Let me rearrange and complete the squares to confirm. For the x terms: x² + 6x, and the y terms: y² - 24y. The constant term is 72. Completing the square for x: x² + 6x = (x + 3)² - 9. For y: y² - 24y = (y - 12)² - 144. So substituting back into the equation: (x + 3)² - 9 + (y - 12)² - 144 + 72 = 0. Simplify the constants: -9 -144 +72 = -81. So (x + 3)² + (y - 12)² -81 = 0, which becomes (x + 3)² + (y - 12)² = 81. So that's a circle with center at (-3, 12) and radius 9.

The second equation is x² - y² + 6x + 16y - 46 = 0. This looks like a hyperbola because of the x² - y² term. Let me rewrite it. Group x terms and y terms: (x² + 6x) - (y² - 16y) - 46 = 0. Complete the squares for each. For x: x² + 6x = (x + 3)² - 9. For y: y² - 16y = (y - 8)² - 64. So substituting back: (x + 3)² - 9 - [(y - 8)² - 64] -46 = 0. Simplify: (x + 3)² -9 - (y - 8)² +64 -46 = 0. Combine constants: -9 +64 -46 = 9. So the equation becomes (x + 3)² - (y - 8)² + 9 = 0, which rearranged is (x + 3)² - (y - 8)² = -9. Dividing both sides by -9 to get standard form: [(y - 8)² - (x + 3)²]/9 = 1. So that's a hyperbola centered at (-3, 8), opening upwards and downwards, with a² = 9 and b² = 9. So a = 3, b = 3.

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Wait, actually, standard form for hyperbola is [(y - k)²/a²] - [(x - h)²/b²] = 1. So in this case, [(y - 8)²/9] - [(x + 3)²/9] = 1. So yes, centered at (-3, 8), with a = 3, b = 3.

Now, the problem states that these two graphs intersect at four points. We need to find these four points, then compute the sum of the distances from each of these points to (-3, 2).

First step: find the intersection points of the circle and the hyperbola.

To find the intersection points, we can solve the two equations simultaneously. Let me write them again:

<prompt_2.1> Solve the system of equations representing the circle and hyperbola to find their intersection points. </prompt_2.1>

Alternatively, since the sum of distances from four points to (-3,2), perhaps there is a property that can be used to avoid finding each point individually? Maybe using the concept of power of a point or something else.

<prompt_2.2> Consider alternative methods or properties that could simplify finding the sum of distances. </prompt_2.2>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
1. Circle: (x + 3)² + (y - 12)² = 81
2. Hyperbola: (x + 3)² - (y - 8)² = -9

Let me denote (x + 3)² as A and (y - 12)² as B, (y - 8)² as C. Then the equations become:

1. A + B = 81
2. A - C = -9

But maybe subtract the second equation from the first? Let's see:

Equation 1: A + B = 81

Equation 2: A - C = -9

Subtract equation 2 from equation 1: (A + B) - (A - C) = 81 - (-9) => A + B - A + C = 90 => B + C = 90.

So (y - 12)² + (y - 8)² = 90. Let's expand this:

(y - 12)² + (y - 8)² = (y² - 24y + 144) + (y² - 16y + 64) = 2y² - 40y + 208 = 90.

So 2y² - 40y + 208 - 90 = 0 => 2y² - 40y + 118 = 0. Divide by 2: y² - 20y + 59 = 0.

Solve for y using quadratic formula: y = [20 ± sqrt(400 - 236)] / 2 = [20 ± sqrt(164)] / 2 = [20 ± 2*sqrt(41)] / 2 = 10 ± sqrt(41). So y = 10 + sqrt(41) and y = 10 - sqrt(41).

Now, plug these back into one of the equations to find x. Let's use equation 2: (x + 3)² - (y - 8)² = -9. So (x + 3)² = (y - 8)² -9.

First, for y = 10 + sqrt(41):

Compute (y - 8) = (10 + sqrt(41) - 8) = 2 + sqrt(41). Then (y - 8)² = (2 + sqrt(41))² = 4 + 4*sqrt(41) + 41 = 45 + 4*sqrt(41).

So (x + 3)² = 45 + 4*sqrt(41) - 9 = 36 + 4*sqrt(41). Therefore, x + 3 = ±sqrt(36 + 4*sqrt(41)).

Simplify sqrt(36 + 4*sqrt(41)). Let me see if this can be written as sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Suppose sqrt(36 + 4*sqrt(41)) = sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Then squaring both sides: 36 + 4*sqrt(41) = a + b + 2*sqrt(ab). Therefore, we need:

a + b = 36

2*sqrt(ab) = 4*sqrt(41) => sqrt(ab) = 2*sqrt(41) => ab = 4*41 = 164.

So we have a + b = 36 and ab = 164. Let's solve for a and b. The quadratic equation would be t² - 36t + 164 = 0. Discriminant: 1296 - 656 = 640. sqrt(640) = 8*sqrt(10). So t = [36 ± 8*sqrt(10)] / 2 = 18 ± 4*sqrt(10). Hmm, not nice integers. Maybe my assumption is wrong. Perhaps it can't be simplified further. So we'll just leave it as sqrt(36 + 4*sqrt(41)).

Therefore, x = -3 ± sqrt(36 + 4*sqrt(41)).

Similarly, for y = 10 - sqrt(41):

Compute (y - 8) = (10 - sqrt(41) - 8) = 2 - sqrt(41). Then (y - 8)² = (2 - sqrt(41))² = 4 - 4*sqrt(41) + 41 = 45 - 4*sqrt(41).

So (x + 3)² = 45 - 4*sqrt(41) - 9 = 36 - 4*sqrt(41). Therefore, x + 3 = ±sqrt(36 - 4*sqrt(41)).

Again, check if sqrt(36 - 4*sqrt(41)) can be simplified. Let's assume sqrt(36 - 4*sqrt(41)) = sqrt(a) - sqrt(b). Then squaring: 36 - 4*sqrt(41) = a + b - 2*sqrt(ab). So:

a + b = 36

-2*sqrt(ab) = -4*sqrt(41) => sqrt(ab) = 2*sqrt(41) => ab = 164.

Same as before, so a and b are 18 ± 4*sqrt(10). So again, not nice. So we can just write sqrt(36 - 4*sqrt(41)).

Therefore, x = -3 ± sqrt(36 - 4*sqrt(41)).

So the four intersection points are:

1. (-3 + sqrt(36 + 4*sqrt(41)), 10 + sqrt(41))

2. (-3 - sqrt(36 + 4*sqrt(41)), 10 + sqrt(41))

3. (-3 + sqrt(36 - 4*sqrt(41)), 10 - sqrt(41))

4. (-3 - sqrt(36 - 4*sqrt(41)), 10 - sqrt(41))

Wait, the point (-3,2) is inside the circle? Let's check. The center of the circle is (-3,12), radius 9. The distance from (-3,12) to (-3,2) is |12 - 2| = 10. But the radius is 9, so (-3,2) is outside the circle. Hmm. So four points of intersection, each outside (-3,2)? Wait, no, the hyperbola can have points inside and outside. Maybe not. Wait, the hyperbola is centered at (-3,8), opening up and down. The circle is centered at (-3,12) with radius 9. The center of the circle is 4 units above the center of the hyperbola. The hyperbola has vertices at (-3, 8 ± 3) = (-3,11) and (-3,5). So the upper vertex of the hyperbola is at (-3,11), which is 1 unit below the center of the circle at (-3,12). So the hyperbola's upper vertex is inside the circle? The distance from (-3,12) to (-3,11) is 1, which is less than the radius 9. So yes, the vertex is inside. Therefore, the hyperbola intersects the circle in four points. The point (-3,2) is on the same vertical line as the centers, 10 units below the circle's center. So likely outside both. But the sum of distances from four intersection points to this external point.

Based on execution_2.1:
Hmm, these expressions look a bit complicated. Let me see if there's a smarter way to approach this.

Alternatively, maybe instead of solving for x and y directly, we can use the fact that the four points lie on both the circle and the hyperbola, so their coordinates satisfy both equations. Then, perhaps, the sum of distances can be related to some properties of the circle and hyperbola.

But the problem is asking for the sum of the Euclidean distances from each of the four points to (-3,2). That seems like it would require calculating each distance individually, which would be tedious given the expressions for x and y involve square roots. There must be a trick here.

Wait a minute, the point (-3,2) is interesting. Let's note that the circle is centered at (-3,12), so the point (-3,2) is vertically below the center, 10 units down.

Based on execution_2.2:
Alternatively, maybe the sum can be computed using some algebraic manipulation. Let me think.

<prompt_3.2> Explore algebraic manipulation to find the sum of distances from the intersection points to (-3,2). </prompt_3.2>

Alternatively, since all four points lie on the circle (x +3)^2 + (y -12)^2 =81, each point (x,y) satisfies this equation. The distance from (x,y) to (-3,2) is sqrt( (x +3)^2 + (y -2)^2 ). Let’s denote this distance as D = sqrt( (x +3)^2 + (y -2)^2 ). Since (x +3)^2 = 81 - (y -12)^2 from the circle equation, substitute that into D:

The hyperbola is centered at (-3,8). Let's recall that the vertices of the hyperbola are at (-3,8 ±3), which are (-3,11) and (-3,5). So the upper vertex is at (-3,11), which is inside the circle (distance from (-3,12) is 1). The lower vertex is at (-3,5), which is 7 units away from the center of the circle, so also inside the circle (since radius is 9). So the hyperbola's vertices are inside the circle, which might mean that the hyperbola intersects the circle in four points: two above the center of the hyperbola and two below? Hmm, but the hyperbola opens up and down, so maybe two intersections above and two below?

But regardless, the problem states there are four intersection points. So we need to find these four points.

But given the complexity of the coordinates, maybe there's a smarter way to compute the sum of distances without finding each point individually.

Let me denote the four intersection points as (x₁, y₁), (x₂, y₂), (x₃, y₃), (x₄, y₄). The sum we need is sqrt( (x₁ +3)^2 + (y₁ -2)^2 ) + sqrt( (x₂ +3)^2 + (y₂ -2)^2 ) + ... + sqrt( (x₄ +3)^2 + (y₄ -2)^2 ).

But given the complexity of the coordinates, this seems intractable. Maybe there's a geometric property here. Let me recall that the sum of distances from a point to the intersections of two conics might relate to something, but I can't remember.

D = sqrt(81 - (y -12)^2 + (y -2)^2 )

Let me compute the expression inside the square root:

81 - (y² -24y +144) + (y² -4y +4) = 81 - y² +24y -144 + y² -4y +4 = (81 -144 +4) + (24y -4y) = (-59) + 20y.

So D = sqrt(20y -59). Therefore, the distance from any point (x,y) on the circle to (-3,2) is sqrt(20y -59). Therefore, the sum of distances would be the sum over the four points of sqrt(20y_i -59), where y_i are the y-coordinates of the intersection points.

Based on execution_3.3:
 But from the hyperbola equation, we have (x +3)^2 - (y -8)^2 = -9. From the circle equation, (x +3)^2 = 81 - (y -12)^2. Substitute into hyperbola equation:

81 - (y -12)^2 - (y -8)^2 = -9.

Wait, that's exactly the equation we solved earlier to find the y-coordinates! Which led us to y² -20y +59=0, whose roots are y=10 ±sqrt(41). Therefore, the four points have y-coordinates 10 + sqrt(41) and 10 - sqrt(41), each appearing twice? Wait, no. Wait, each y-coordinate corresponds to two x-values (positive and negative sqrt). So for each y (10 + sqrt(41) and 10 - sqrt(41)), there are two x-values. Therefore, total four points.

But according to the equation above, the distance D = sqrt(20y -59). So for each y, we have two points with the same y, so each contributes sqrt(20y -59) twice. Therefore, the total sum would be 2*sqrt(20y₁ -59) + 2*sqrt(20y₂ -59), where y₁ =10 + sqrt(41) and y₂=10 - sqrt(41). Wait, but since both y₁ and y₂ are roots of y² -20y +59=0, maybe there's a relation here.

Let me compute 20y -59 for y =10 ±sqrt(41):

For y₁ =10 + sqrt(41):

20y₁ -59 = 20*(10 + sqrt(41)) -59 = 200 +20sqrt(41) -59 = 141 +20sqrt(41)

For y₂ =10 - sqrt(41):

20y₂ -59 = 20*(10 - sqrt(41)) -59 = 200 -20sqrt(41) -59 = 141 -20sqrt(41)

Therefore, the distance for each y₁ is sqrt(141 +20sqrt(41)) and for y₂ is sqrt(141 -20sqrt(41)). Since there are two points for each y, the total sum is 2*[sqrt(141 +20sqrt(41)) + sqrt(141 -20sqrt(41))].

So now, the problem reduces to computing 2*[sqrt(141 +20sqrt(41)) + sqrt(141 -20sqrt(41))]. Let's see if this expression simplifies.

Let me denote S = sqrt(141 +20sqrt(41)) + sqrt(141 -20sqrt(41)). Let's compute S²:

S² = [sqrt(141 +20sqrt(41)) + sqrt(141 -20sqrt(41))]² = (141 +20sqrt(41)) + (141 -20sqrt(41)) + 2*sqrt{(141 +20sqrt(41))(141 -20sqrt(41))}.

Simplify:

141 +20sqrt(41) +141 -20sqrt(41) = 282.

The cross term: 2*sqrt{(141)² - (20sqrt(41))²} = 2*sqrt{141² - 400*41}.

Compute 141²: 141*141. Let's compute 140²=19600, so 141² = (140+1)² = 140² +2*140*1 +1 = 19600 +280 +1=19881.

400*41=16400.

So 141² -400*41=19881 -16400=3481.

sqrt(3481)=59. Because 59²=3481.

Therefore, S²=282 +2*59=282 +118=400. Therefore, S= sqrt(400)=20. Therefore, S=20. Therefore, the total sum of distances is 2*S=40.

<execution_4.2>
Let me think. Since we have two equations:

1. (x +3)^2 + (y -12)^2 =81

2. (x +3)^2 - (y -8)^2 = -9

Let me subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

[(x +3)^2 + (y -12)^2] - [(x +3)^2 - (y -8)^2] =81 - (-9)

Simplify left side: (x +3)^2 - (x +3)^2 + (y -12)^2 + (y -8)^2 =90

So (y -12)^2 + (y -8)^2 =90, which is exactly what I did earlier. Which leads to y² -20y +59=0. So the y-coordinates are 10 ±sqrt(41). So each y corresponds to two x's, hence four points. So that gives us four points as above.

But perhaps instead of computing each distance, notice that for each y, we have two x's (positive and negative sqrt). Let me denote for each y_i, the two x's are -3 ± sqrt(81 - (y_i -12)^2). Then the distance from each (x,y) to (-3,2) is sqrt( (x +3)^2 + (y -2)^2 ) = sqrt( (sqrt(81 - (y -12)^2 ))^2 + (y -2)^2 ). Wait, but earlier we found that (x +3)^2 =81 - (y -12)^2, so yes, so the distance becomes sqrt(81 - (y -12)^2 + (y -2)^2 ). Which simplifies to sqrt(81 - (y² -24y +144) + (y² -4y +4)) = sqrt(81 - y² +24y -144 + y² -4y +4) = sqrt(20y -59). So for each y, the distance is sqrt(20y -59). Since each y has two points (with same y but different x), each y contributes two distances of sqrt(20y -59). Therefore, total sum is 2*[sqrt(20y₁ -59) + sqrt(20y₂ -59)], where y₁ and y₂ are the two y-values (10 ±sqrt(41)).

So if I can compute sqrt(20y -59) for each y, then add them and multiply by 2.

Let's compute for y₁ =10 + sqrt(41):

sqrt(20*(10 + sqrt(41)) -59) = sqrt(200 +20sqrt(41) -59) = sqrt(141 +20sqrt(41)).

Similarly, for y₂=10 - sqrt(41):

sqrt(20*(10 - sqrt(41)) -59) = sqrt(200 -20sqrt(41) -59) = sqrt(141 -20sqrt(41)).

Therefore, the total sum is 2*[sqrt(141 +20sqrt(41)) + sqrt(141 -20sqrt(41))].

Now, let's compute sqrt(141 +20sqrt(41)) + sqrt(141 -20sqrt(41)). Let me denote this sum as S.

Let S = sqrt(141 +20sqrt(41)) + sqrt(141 -20sqrt(41)).

Compute S²:

S² = [sqrt(141 +20sqrt(41)) + sqrt(141 -20sqrt(41))]²

= (141 +20sqrt(41)) + (141 -20sqrt(41)) + 2*sqrt{(141 +20sqrt(41))(141 -20sqrt(41))}

Simplify:

= 141 +141 +20sqrt(41)-20sqrt(41) + 2*sqrt(141² - (20sqrt(41))²)

= 282 + 2*sqrt(141² - 400*41)

Compute the term under the square root:

141² = (140 +1)² = 140² +2*140*1 +1 = 19600 +280 +1=19881

400*41=16400

So 141² -400*41=19881 -16400=3481

sqrt(3481)=59

Therefore, S²=282 +2*59=282 +118=400

Thus, S= sqrt(400)=20

Therefore, the total sum of distances is 2*20=40.
