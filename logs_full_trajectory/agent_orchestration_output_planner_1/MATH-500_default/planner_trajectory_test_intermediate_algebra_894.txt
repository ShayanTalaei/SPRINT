Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have an ellipse given by the equation kx² + y² = 1, where k > 1 is a constant. The foci of this ellipse are F₁ and F₂. There's a circle that passes through these two foci and is tangent to the ellipse at two points on the x-axis. We need to find the value of k.

First, let me recall some basic properties of ellipses. The standard form of an ellipse is (x²/a²) + (y²/b²) = 1, where a and b are the semi-major and semi-minor axes. The distance between the center and each focus is c, where c² = a² - b². The foci are located along the major axis.

In our given equation, kx² + y² = 1, we can rewrite this in the standard form by dividing both sides by 1.
So, that gives x²/(1/k) + y²/1 = 1. Therefore, a² = 1/k and b² = 1. Since k > 1, 1/k is less than 1, which means that the major axis is along the y-axis because the larger denominator is under y². Wait, but in the standard form, if a² > b², then the major axis is along the x-axis. Hmm, maybe I need to check that again.

<execution_1.1>
Hold on, in the standard equation (x²/a²) + (y²/b²) = 1, if a > b, then the major axis is along the x-axis, and if b > a, it's along the y-axis. In our case, since k > 1, 1/k < 1, so b² = 1 is greater than a² = 1/k. Therefore, the major axis is along the y-axis. That means the foci are located along the y-axis, right? But the problem mentions foci F₁ and F₂, which are singular, but maybe in the problem statement, they just use two foci, plural, which is correct for an ellipse. Wait, actually, an ellipse has two foci, regardless of the axis. So, if the major axis is along the y-axis, then the foci are at (0, ±c), where c² = b² - a². Let me confirm that. Yes, when the major axis is along the y-axis, the relationship is c² = b² - a².

Based on execution_1.1:
So, in our case, a² = 1/k and b² = 1. Therefore, c² = b² - a² = 1 - 1/k. Therefore, the foci are at (0, ±√(1 - 1/k)). So, F₁ is (0, √(1 - 1/k)) and F₂ is (0, -√(1 - 1/k)).

Now, the problem states that there is a circle passing through these two foci, F₁ and F₂, and this circle is tangent to the ellipse at two points on the x-axis. So, the circle passes through both foci and is tangent to the ellipse at two points where the ellipse intersects the x-axis.

First, let's find the points where the ellipse intersects the x-axis.

<prompt_2.1> Find the x-intercepts of the ellipse and determine the points of tangency. </prompt_2.1>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Setting y = 0 in the ellipse equation, we get kx² = 1, so x² = 1/k, which gives x = ±1/√k. So, the ellipse intersects the x-axis at (1/√k, 0) and (-1/√k, 0). These are the points of tangency with the circle. So, the circle is tangent to the ellipse at these two points.

Now, the circle passes through F₁ and F₂, which are on the y-axis, and is tangent to the ellipse at (1/√k, 0) and (-1/√k, 0). So, the circle must pass through these four points: (1/√k, 0), (-1/√k, 0), (0, √(1 - 1/k)), and (0, -√(1 - 1/k)). Wait, but a circle is defined by three non-collinear points. If the circle passes through these four points, they must all lie on the same circle. However, since the points (1/√k, 0) and (-1/√k, 0) are symmetric about the y-axis, and the foci are also on the y-axis, the circle must be symmetric with respect to the y-axis. Therefore, the center of the circle must lie on the y-axis.

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Let me denote the center of the circle as (0, h), and the radius as r. Then, the equation of the circle is x² + (y - h)² = r².

Since the circle passes through the points (1/√k, 0) and (0, √(1 - 1/k)), we can substitute these points into the circle equation to get equations for r and h.

<prompt_3.1> Determine the equation of the circle using the points (1/√k, 0) and (0, √(1 - 1/k)). </prompt_3.1>

Similarly, the circle passes through (-1/√k, 0), which would give the same equation as for (1/√k, 0).

Now, we also know that the circle is tangent to the ellipse at (1/√k, 0) and (-1/√k, 0). So, at these points of tangency, the tangent lines to the circle and the ellipse must be the same. Therefore, the gradients (slopes of the tangent lines) of the circle and the ellipse at these points must be equal.

<prompt_3.2> Use the condition of tangency between the circle and the ellipse at (1/√k, 0) to find k. </prompt_3.2>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
First, substituting (1/√k, 0) into the circle equation:

(1/√k)² + (0 - h)² = r² => 1/k + h² = r². (1)

Next, substituting (0, √(1 - 1/k)) into the circle equation:

0² + (√(1 - 1/k) - h)² = r² => (sqrt(1 - 1/k) - h)^2 = r². (2)

Since both equal r², we can set them equal to each other:

1/k + h² = (sqrt(1 - 1/k) - h)^2.

Let me expand the right-hand side:

(sqrt(1 - 1/k) - h)^2 = (1 - 1/k) - 2h sqrt(1 - 1/k) + h².

Therefore, setting equal to left-hand side:

1/k + h² = (1 - 1/k) - 2h sqrt(1 - 1/k) + h².

Subtract h² from both sides:

1/k = 1 - 1/k - 2h sqrt(1 - 1/k).

Let me rearrange terms:

1/k + 1/k = 1 - 2h sqrt(1 - 1/k).

So, 2/k = 1 - 2h sqrt(1 - 1/k).

Let me write this as:

2h sqrt(1 - 1/k) = 1 - 2/k.

Divide both sides by 2:

h sqrt(1 - 1/k) = (1/2) - (1/k).

Let me note this equation as equation (3):

h sqrt(1 - 1/k) = (1/2) - (1/k). (3)

<execution_3.2>
So, let's compute the derivatives (gradients) of the ellipse and the circle at the point (1/√k, 0) and set them equal.

First, let's find the derivative of the ellipse kx² + y² = 1. Differentiating implicitly with respect to x:

2kx + 2y(dy/dx) = 0 => dy/dx = - (2kx)/(2y) = - (kx)/y.

At the point (1/√k, 0), the derivative would be - (k*(1/√k))/0, which is undefined. That is, the tangent line at (1/√k, 0) is vertical. So, the tangent line is parallel to the y-axis.

Now, let's compute the derivative of the circle x² + (y - h)^2 = r^2 at the point (1/√k, 0). Differentiating implicitly:

2x + 2(y - h)(dy/dx) = 0 => dy/dx = -x / (y - h).

At the point (1/√k, 0), this becomes:

dy/dx = - (1/√k) / (0 - h) = (1/√k) / h.

Since the tangent lines must be the same at the point of tangency, the slope from the circle must equal the slope from the ellipse. However, the slope from the ellipse is undefined (vertical), so the slope from the circle must also be undefined. That would require the denominator in the circle's derivative to be zero, i.e., y - h = 0. But at the point (1/√k, 0), y = 0, so 0 - h = -h. For the slope to be undefined, we need -h = 0, so h = 0. Wait, but if h = 0, then the center of the circle is at (0, 0), and the circle equation becomes x² + y² = r². Then, the radius r would be the distance from (0,0) to (1/√k, 0), which is 1/√k. So, the circle would be x² + y² = 1/k.

But let's check if this circle passes through the foci. The foci are at (0, ±√(1 - 1/k)). Plugging into the circle equation:

0² + (√(1 - 1/k))² = 1/k => (1 - 1/k) = 1/k => 1 - 1/k = 1/k => 1 = 2/k => k = 2.

Wait, that seems straightforward. But let me verify this step by step because maybe I oversimplified.

Wait, if h = 0, then the center is at (0,0), and the circle passes through (1/√k, 0) and (0, ±√(1 - 1/k)). Let's compute the radius.

From (1/√k, 0) to (0,0), the radius is 1/√k. From (0,0) to (0, ±√(1 - 1/k)) is √(1 - 1/k). Therefore, for the circle to pass through both points, the radius must be equal to both 1/√k and √(1 - 1/k). Therefore, 1/√k = √(1 - 1/k). Let's square both sides:

Based on execution_3.2:
1/k = 1 - 1/k.

Then, 1/k + 1/k = 1 => 2/k = 1 => k = 2.

Is that the answer? Wait, but this seems too straightforward, so maybe I made a mistake here.

<prompt_4.1> Verify the solution k = 2 by checking the tangency condition. </prompt_4.1>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
Let me verify.

If k = 2, then the ellipse equation is 2x² + y² = 1. The foci are at (0, ±√(1 - 1/2)) = (0, ±√(1/2)) = (0, ±1/√2). The circle passing through (1/√2, 0), (-1/√2, 0), (0, 1/√2), and (0, -1/√2) would indeed be x² + y² = 1/2, since the distance from (0,0) to (1/√2, 0) is 1/√2, but (1/√2)^2 + 0^2 = 1/2, so radius squared is 1/2, so equation x² + y² = 1/2. Then, the foci are at (0, ±1/√2), which lie on this circle because 0² + (1/√2)^2 = 1/2. So, yes, the circle x² + y² = 1/2 passes through the foci and the points (±1/√2, 0). Moreover, at the points (±1/√2, 0), the ellipse has a vertical tangent (since dy/dx is undefined), and the circle also has a vertical tangent there (since dy/dx = -x/(y - h), but h = 0 here, so dy/dx = -x/y, and at y = 0, the slope is undefined). Therefore, the tangents match. So, in this case, k = 2 satisfies all conditions.

Based on execution_4.1:
But wait, the problem says "a circle which passes through F₁ and F₂ and lies tangent to the ellipse at two points on the x-axis". So, in this case, the circle is centered at the origin, passes through the foci and the x-intercepts of the ellipse. But in this case, the tangency points are exactly the x-intercepts.
So, is this the only possible circle? Because if we assume that the circle is centered at the origin, then yes, but maybe there is another circle that is not centered at the origin but still passes through the foci and is tangent at two points on the x-axis. However, given the symmetry, since the foci are on the y-axis and the points of tangency are on the x-axis, the circle must be symmetric with respect to both axes, hence centered at the origin. Therefore, the only such circle is the one centered at the origin, which leads us to k = 2. Therefore, the answer is k = 2.

But let me check again if there could be another circle. Suppose the circle is not centered at the origin. Then, it would have to pass through (0, c) and (0, -c) (the foci) and also (a, 0) and (-a, 0) (the x-intercepts of the ellipse). But if a circle passes through (a, 0), (-a, 0), (0, c), and (0, -c), then the center must be at the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of these points. The perpendicular bisector of (a, 0) and (-a, 0) is the y-axis. The perpendicular bisector of (0, c) and (0, -c) is the x-axis. Therefore, the only point equidistant from all four points is the origin. Therefore, the circle must be centered at the origin. Hence, there is only one such circle, which is x² + y² = a², where a is the distance from the origin to any of the points. Since it passes through (a, 0), then a² = a², which is trivial, but also passes through (0, c), so 0 + c² = a² => a² = c². Therefore, the circle is x² + y² = c². But the points (a, 0) lie on the circle, so a² + 0 = c² => a = c. Wait, but in our case, the points (1/√k, 0) are on the ellipse and on the circle. So, if the circle is x² + y² = c², then (1/√k)^2 + 0 = c² => c² = 1/k. But also, the foci are at (0, ±c), where c² = 1 - 1/k. Wait, but if the circle is centered at the origin, then the foci are at (0, ±c), but the circle's radius is also c. Therefore, 1/k = c², but c² is also equal to 1 - 1/k. Therefore, 1/k = 1 - 1/k => 2/k = 1 => k = 2. So, this confirms again that k = 2. Therefore, the answer is 2.

Wait, but let me make sure that the tangency condition is satisfied. If the circle is x² + y² = 1/2 (since k = 2), then at the point (1/√2, 0), the tangent line is vertical, as we saw earlier. For the ellipse, which is 2x² + y² = 1, at the point (1/√2, 0), the derivative is dy/dx = - (kx)/y. But here, y = 0, so the derivative is undefined, which is a vertical line. Therefore, both the ellipse and the circle have a vertical tangent at that point, so they are indeed tangent there. Therefore, the conditions are satisfied.

Therefore, the value of k is 2.

**Final Answer**
The value of \( k \) is \(\boxed{2}\).
