Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, we have two polynomials: one is 3t² + 5t + a and the other is 4t² + bt - 2. When we multiply them together, the result is given as 12t⁴ + 26t³ -8t² -16t +6. We need to find the sum of a and b. Hmm, okay.

First, I remember that when you multiply two polynomials, you have to distribute each term in the first polynomial with each term in the second polynomial and then combine like terms. So maybe I should start by expanding the product of the two given polynomials and then compare the coefficients with the resulting polynomial provided. That should help me find the values of a and b, right?

Let me write down the multiplication step by step.

<execution_1.1>
First, multiply 3t² by each term in the second polynomial:

3t² * 4t² = 12t⁴

3t² * bt = 3b t³

3t² * (-2) = -6t²

Next, multiply 5t by each term in the second polynomial:

5t * 4t² = 20t³

5t * bt = 5b t²

5t * (-2) = -10t

Then, multiply a by each term in the second polynomial:

a * 4t² = 4a t²

a * bt = ab t

a * (-2) = -2a

Now, let's combine all these terms:

12t⁴ + 3b t³ + 20t³ + (-6t²) + 5b t² + (-10t) + 4a t² + ab t + (-2a)

Based on execution_1.1:
Now, let's combine like terms. Let's start with the highest degree term, t⁴.

<prompt_2.1> Combine like terms in the expanded polynomial starting with the highest degree term. </prompt_2.1>

Now, let's look at the coefficients for each power of t:

For t⁴: 12t⁴. That's correct in both the product and the given polynomial.

<prompt_2.2> Compare the coefficients of the expanded polynomial with the given polynomial. </prompt_2.2>

But just to be thorough, let me check if there's another way to find a and b by looking at specific terms. Sometimes, people use the "coefficients method" or even plug in specific values of t, but since these are polynomials, plugging in specific t values might not work unless the product is valid for all t, which it is here. However, since the product is given as a polynomial, we can equate coefficients.

Alternatively, maybe check the constant term. In the product, the constant term is -2a, and in the given polynomial, the constant term is +6. So, setting -2a = 6 gives a = -3, which matches our previous result.

There's only one t⁴ term: 12t⁴.

Next, the t³ terms: 3b t³ + 20t³. So that's (3b + 20) t³.

Then the t² terms: -6t² + 5b t² + 4a t². Combining those gives (-6 + 5b + 4a) t².

The t terms: -10t + ab t. So that's (-10 + ab) t.

Finally, the constant term: -2a.

So the expanded polynomial is:

12t⁴ + (3b + 20)t³ + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t² + (-10 + ab)t + (-2a)
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Okay, moving on to t³. The coefficients here are 3b and 20. So combined, that's (3b + 20)t³. In the given polynomial, the coefficient for t³ is 26. So we can set up the equation 3b + 20 = 26. Let's solve that: 3b = 26 - 20 = 6, so b = 2.
</execution_2.2>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Now, according to the problem, this should equal the given polynomial: 12t⁴ + 26t³ -8t² -16t +6. Therefore, we can equate the coefficients of corresponding terms.

<prompt_3.1> Equate the coefficients of the expanded polynomial with the given polynomial and solve for a and b. </prompt_3.1>

<execution_3.1>
Let's write those equations down:

1. For t⁴: 12 = 12. That checks out, so no new information here.
2. For t³: 3b + 20 = 26
3. For t²: -6 + 5b + 4a = -8
4. For t: -10 + ab = -16
5. For the constant term: -2a = 6

Okay, so we have three equations here with two variables, a and b. Let's see if these equations are consistent. Let's start with the constant term since that looks simple.

Equation 5: -2a = 6. Solving for a: divide both sides by -2, so a = 6 / (-2) = -3. So a = -3.

Now, let's check equation 2: 3b + 20 = 26. Subtract 20 from both sides: 3b = 6. So b = 6 / 3 = 2. So b = 2.

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
Now, let's verify if these values satisfy equations 3 and 4. Let's substitute a = -3 and b = 2 into equation 3:

<prompt_4.1> Verify if the values of a and b satisfy the equations for t² and t terms. </prompt_4.1>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
Equation 3: -6 + 5b + 4a = -6 + 5*2 + 4*(-3) = -6 + 10 -12 = (-6 + 10) -12 = 4 -12 = -8. Which matches the given coefficient of -8. Perfect.

Now equation 4: -10 + ab = -16. Let's compute ab with a = -3 and b = 2: (-3)(2) = -6. Then, -10 + (-6) = -16. Which also matches the given coefficient. Great!

So both a and b satisfy all the equations. Therefore, a = -3 and b = 2.

<Plan_5>
Based on execution_4.1:
Therefore, a + b = -3 + 2 = -1.

Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let's redo the verification steps.

<prompt_5.1> Re-verify the solution by redoing the verification steps for a and b. </prompt_5.1>
</Plan_5>

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
First, a = -3, b = 2.

Equation 5: -2a = -2*(-3) = 6. Which matches the constant term. Correct.

Equation 2: 3b + 20 = 3*2 + 20 = 6 + 20 = 26. Correct.

Equation 3: -6 + 5b + 4a = -6 + 5*2 + 4*(-3) = -6 + 10 -12 = -8. Correct.

Equation 4: -10 + ab = -10 + (-3)(2) = -10 -6 = -16. Correct.

All equations are satisfied.

<Plan_6>
Based on execution_5.1:
Therefore, the answer is a + b = -3 + 2 = -1. Hmm, seems straightforward. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe multiply the polynomials again with these values substituted in to see if we indeed get the given product.

<prompt_6.1> Substitute the values of a and b into the original polynomials and verify the product. </prompt_6.1>
</Plan_6>

<Execution_6>
<execution_6.1>
Original polynomials:

First polynomial: 3t² + 5t + a = 3t² + 5t -3.

Second polynomial: 4t² + bt -2 = 4t² + 2t -2.

Multiply them:

(3t² +5t -3)(4t² +2t -2).

Let me compute this step by step.

First, 3t²*(4t² +2t -2) = 12t⁴ +6t³ -6t².

Then, 5t*(4t² +2t -2) = 20t³ +10t² -10t.

Then, -3*(4t² +2t -2) = -12t² -6t +6.

Now, add all these together:

12t⁴ +6t³ -6t² +20t³ +10t² -10t -12t² -6t +6.

Combine like terms:

12t⁴.

For t³: 6t³ +20t³ =26t³.

For t²: -6t² +10t² -12t² = (-6 +10 -12)t² = (-8)t².

For t: -10t -6t = -16t.

Constants: +6.

So the product is 12t⁴ +26t³ -8t² -16t +6, which exactly matches the given polynomial. Therefore, the values of a = -3 and b = 2 are correct, so a + b = -1.
