Okay, so I need to find the eighth term of this geometric sequence: 125/9, 25/3, 5, 3, .... Let me start by recalling what a geometric sequence is. In a geometric sequence, each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the common ratio, usually denoted as r. So, to find the eighth term, I should first figure out what the common ratio is.

<prompt_1.1> Identify the first term and calculate the common ratio of the geometric sequence using the given terms. </prompt_1.1>

Let me write down the given terms:

First term (a₁) = 125/9

Second term (a₂) = 25/3

Third term (a₃) = 5

Fourth term (a₄) = 3

Hmm, okay. So, to find the common ratio r, I can divide the second term by the first term. That should give me the ratio between consecutive terms. Let me compute that:

r = a₂ / a₁ = (25/3) ÷ (125/9)

Dividing fractions is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal, so:

r = (25/3) * (9/125) = (25 * 9) / (3 * 125)

Let me simplify that. 25 divided by 125 is 1/5, and 9 divided by 3 is 3. So:

r = (1/5) * 3 = 3/5

Wait, let me check that again. 25 times 9 is 225, and 3 times 125 is 375. So 225/375 simplifies to 3/5. Yep, that's correct. So the common ratio r is 3/5.

Based on execution_1.1:
Let me verify this ratio with the next terms to make sure it's consistent.

<prompt_2.1> Verify the common ratio by checking it against the subsequent terms of the sequence. </prompt_2.1>

Now, since it's a geometric sequence, the nth term can be found using the formula:

aₙ = a₁ * r^(n-1)

We need to find the eighth term, so n = 8. Let's plug in the values:

But let me check if I made any mistake in the exponent. Since the first term is 125/9, which is term 1, then term 8 would be term 1 multiplied by r 7 times.

<prompt_2.3> Verify the calculation of the eighth term by considering the number of times the common ratio is applied. </prompt_2.3>

Alternatively, maybe I can compute each term step by step to verify:

Term 1: 125/9 ≈ 13.888...

<prompt_2.4> Compute each term of the sequence step by step to verify the consistency of the common ratio and the eighth term. </prompt_2.4>

Third term should be a₂ * r = (25/3) * (3/5) = (25/3)*(3/5) = 25/5 = 5. That's correct, which matches the given third term. Then the fourth term should be a₃ * r = 5 * (3/5) = 3. That's also given. So, the common ratio is definitely 3/5.

<execution_2.2>
a₈ = (125/9) * (3/5)^(8-1) = (125/9) * (3/5)^7

Hmm, okay, that seems right. Let me compute (3/5)^7 first. But maybe there's a way to simplify this before multiplying everything out. Let me see.

First, let's note that 125 is 5^3, and 5^3 in the numerator. The denominator is 9, which is 3^2. Then, the common ratio is 3/5, which when raised to the 7th power becomes 3^7 / 5^7. So let's write all the components:

a₈ = (5^3 / 3^2) * (3^7 / 5^7) = (5^3 * 3^7) / (3^2 * 5^7)

Now, simplifying the exponents:

For the 3s: 3^(7-2) = 3^5

For the 5s: 5^(3-7) = 5^(-4) = 1/5^4

So, combining these:

a₈ = 3^5 / 5^4

Compute 3^5: 3*3=9, 9*3=27, 27*3=81, 81*3=243. So 3^5 = 243

Compute 5^4: 5*5=25, 25*5=125, 125*5=625. So 5^4 = 625

Therefore, a₈ = 243 / 625

<execution_2.3>
So that's r^(7). Let's confirm that.

Yes, the formula is a₁ * r^(n-1). So for n=8, it's r^7. Since r is 3/5, then (3/5)^7. Then multiply by 125/9. So that's correct.

Term 2: 125/9 * 3/5 = (125*3)/(9*5) = 375/45 = 25/3 ≈ 8.333... Correct.

Term 3: 25/3 * 3/5 = (25*3)/(3*5) = 75/15 = 5. Correct.

Term 4: 5 * 3/5 = 15/5 = 3. Correct.

Term 5: 3 * 3/5 = 9/5 = 1.8

Term 6: 9/5 * 3/5 = 27/25 = 1.08

Term 7: 27/25 * 3/5 = 81/125 ≈ 0.648

Term 8: 81/125 * 3/5 = 243/625 ≈ 0.389

Wait, let me check that again.
Wait, 3^5 is 243 and 5^4 is 625, so yes, 243/625.

Let me check if 243/625 is the correct answer. Let me simplify this fraction.

243 is 3^5, 625 is 5^4. There are no common factors, so 243/625 is already in simplest terms.

Alternatively, if I compute 125/9 * (3/5)^7 step by step:

First, 125/9 * 3/5 = (125*3)/(9*5) = 375/45 = 25/3. That's term 2.

Term 2: 25/3

Term 3: 25/3 * 3/5 = 25/5 = 5

Term 4: 5 * 3/5 = 3

Term 5: 3 * 3/5 = 9/5

Term 6: 9/5 * 3/5 = 27/25

Term 7: 27/25 * 3/5 = 81/125

Term 8: 81/125 * 3/5 = 243/625

Yes, exactly. So, step by step, each term is multiplied by 3/5, and the eighth term is indeed 243/625. Therefore, I can confirm that the eighth term is 243/625.
