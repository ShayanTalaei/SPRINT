<Question>
A gecko is in a room that is 12 feet long, 10 feet wide and 8 feet tall. The gecko is currently on a side wall ($10^{\prime}$ by $8^{\prime}$), one foot from the ceiling and one foot from the back wall ($12^{\prime}$ by $8^{\prime}$). The gecko spots a fly on the opposite side wall, one foot from the floor and one foot from the front wall. What is the length of the shortest path the gecko can take to reach the fly assuming that it does not jump and can only walk across the ceiling and the walls? Express your answer in simplest radical form.

Okay, so there's this gecko in a room that's 12 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 8 feet tall. The gecko is on a side wall, which is 10 feet by 8 feet. It's currently one foot from the ceiling and one foot from the back wall. Then it spots a fly on the opposite side wall, which is also 10 feet by 8 feet, one foot from the floor and one foot from the front wall. The question is asking for the shortest path the gecko can take to reach the fly, considering it can only walk across the ceiling and walls, not jump.

<prompt_1.1> Understand the problem setup, including the dimensions of the room and the initial and final positions of the gecko and the fly. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
Hmm. Alright, let me try to visualize this. The room is a rectangular prism, right? Length 12 ft, width 10 ft, height 8 ft. The gecko is on one of the side walls, which I think is the 10x8 wall. Let me confirm: the side walls would be the ones with dimensions 10 ft (width) by 8 ft (height). Similarly, the front and back walls are 12 ft (length) by 8 ft (height). So the gecko is on a side wall, one foot from the ceiling and one foot from the back wall.

Wait, so the side wall is 10 ft wide (front to back) and 8 ft tall. The gecko is one foot from the ceiling, so that would be 7 feet down from the ceiling, right? And also one foot from the back wall. So on the side wall, it's near the bottom (since it's one foot from the ceiling, which is the top) and also near the back wall. Similarly, the fly is on the opposite side wall, one foot from the floor and one foot from the front wall. So the fly is near the bottom (one foot up) and near the front wall (one foot in from the back).

The gecko wants to get to the fly by walking across the ceiling and walls. So it can't fly through the air or jump; it has to crawl along the surfaces. The shortest path would be a straight line on the unfolded surfaces. This is a classic problem where you can "unfold" the 3D room into a 2D net and then find the straight-line distance between the two points.

But since the gecko is on a side wall and the fly is on the opposite side wall, the gecko would need to traverse from its current position, possibly moving along the side wall, then across the back wall, then up the front wall to the fly's position? Wait, but the fly is on the opposite side wall. So maybe the gecko can go from the side wall to the front wall to the opposite side wall, but that might be a longer path. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to unfold the walls such that the gecko's path becomes a straight line in the 2D net.

Let me try to sketch this mentally.

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
First, let's assign coordinates to the gecko and the fly to better understand their positions.

<prompt_2.1> Assign coordinates to the gecko and the fly based on their positions in the room. </prompt_2.1>
-----

But let me check if there's a shorter path by unfolding differently. For example, maybe instead of going over the back wall, the gecko can go up the side wall, across the ceiling, and then down the front wall. Let me visualize that.

<prompt_2.2> Explore alternative paths by unfolding the room differently and calculate their lengths. </prompt_2.2>

Alternatively, maybe another unfolding. Suppose we unfold the room such that the side wall, back wall, and front wall are all laid out flat. The gecko is on the side wall, one foot from the ceiling (so 7 feet from the floor) and one foot from the back wall. If we unfold the back wall and the front wall into the same plane as the side wall, the fly is on the front wall, one foot from the floor and one foot from the front wall (which is adjacent to the back wall). Wait, maybe this is getting confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the shortest path is across the ceiling. Let me think.

<prompt_2.3> Consider the possibility of the gecko reaching the fly via the ceiling and calculate the path. </prompt_2.3>

Alternatively, if we consider going from the side wall to the ceiling to the opposite side wall. The gecko is on the side wall, one foot from the ceiling. If it crawls up the side wall to the ceiling, which is 7 feet up (since it's one foot from the ceiling), then crosses the ceiling (which is 12 feet long and 10 feet wide), but the fly is on the opposite side wall, one foot from the floor and one foot from the front wall. So, if the gecko goes up the side wall 7 feet to the ceiling, then crosses the ceiling, which is 12 feet long, and then down the front wall 9 feet (since the fly is one foot from the floor, so 9 feet down from the ceiling).

<prompt_2.4> Calculate the path where the gecko moves up the side wall, crosses the ceiling, and then down the front wall. </prompt_2.4>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Let's set up a coordinate system where the side wall the gecko is on is the left wall, with the x-axis running along the length (12 ft), the y-axis running up the width (10 ft), and the z-axis running along the height (8 ft). Wait, actually, maybe it's better to define the coordinate system such that:

- The side wall the gecko is on is the y-z plane (x=0). The gecko is one foot from the ceiling (z=1) and one foot from the back wall (y=10 - 1 = 9? Wait, maybe the room's dimensions are length 12 (x-axis), width 10 (y-axis), height 8 (z-axis). So the side walls are at x=0 and x=12. The front and back walls are at y=0 and y=10. The left and right walls (but since it's a side wall, maybe the x=0 is the side wall). Wait, perhaps I need to clarify the room's orientation.

Wait, the problem states: the room is 12 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 8 feet tall. So:

- Length: 12 ft (x-axis)
- Width: 10 ft (y-axis)
- Height: 8 ft (z-axis)

So the four walls are:

- Front and back walls: y=0 and y=10 (width)
- Left and right walls (side walls): x=0 and x=12 (length)
- The floor and ceiling: z=0 and z=8 (height)

But the problem says the gecko is on a side wall, which would be x=0 or x=12. The gecko is one foot from the ceiling (so z=8 - 1 = 7) and one foot from the back wall. If the back wall is y=10, then the gecko is at y=10 - 1 = 9? Wait, but the side wall is x=0 or x=12. If the gecko is on a side wall (x=0 or x=12), then being one foot from the back wall (y=10) would mean its y-coordinate is 9. But the side walls are at x=0 or x=12, so the gecko is at (0,9,7) if it's on the x=0 wall. The fly is on the opposite side wall, which would be x=12, one foot from the floor (z=1) and one foot from the front wall (y=0 or y=10? Since the front wall is y=0 and back wall is y=10. Wait, the fly is one foot from the front wall, so if the front wall is y=0, then the fly is at y=1, z=8 - 1 =7? Wait, the problem says the fly is one foot from the floor (z=1) and one foot from the front wall (y=1). So the fly is at (12,1,1).
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
If the gecko is on the side wall, moves up to the ceiling, then across the ceiling to the front wall, then down to the fly. Let's see. The gecko is initially on the side wall, 1 foot from the ceiling. So to reach the ceiling, it needs to crawl 7 feet up. Then, the ceiling is 12 feet long and 10 feet wide. The fly is on the opposite side wall, which is 12 feet away. But the fly is also 1 foot from the front wall, so from the ceiling's perspective, the fly is 1 foot from the front edge. So if the gecko reaches the ceiling, it's at the point (12, 10, 8) but relative to the side wall. Wait, maybe this is getting too confusing. Let me try to model this with coordinates.

Let's set up a coordinate system where the room has length along the x-axis (12 ft), width along the y-axis (10 ft), and height along the z-axis (8 ft). Let's assume the gecko is on the side wall which is at y=0 (front wall), but wait, the problem says the gecko is on a side wall, which is 10' by 8', so perhaps the side walls are the ones with width 10 ft and height 8 ft, so y=12 or y=0? Wait, maybe I need to clarify the room's orientation.

Wait, the room is 12 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 8 feet tall. So length is 12 ft (x-axis), width is 10 ft (y-axis), height is 8 ft (z-axis). The side walls would then be the ones that are 10 ft by 8 ft, so either at x=0 or x=12 (front and back walls), or perhaps at y=0 or y=10 (left and right walls)? Wait, maybe the terminology is different. In standard terms, the side walls could be the ones that are not the front or back. Wait, the problem says the gecko is on a side wall, one foot from the ceiling and one foot from the back wall. So the side wall is adjacent to the back wall. So if the back wall is at x=12, then the side wall is at y=10 (assuming the room is oriented with x as length, y as width, z as height). Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to define the coordinate system properly.

Let me define the room with the following coordinates:

- The room extends from x=0 (left wall) to x=12 (right wall, which is the back wall).

- From y=0 (front wall) to y=10 (back wall, which is the opposite side wall).

- From z=0 (floor) to z=8 (ceiling).

So the four walls are:

- Front wall: x=0, y from 0 to 10, z from 0 to 8.

- Back wall: x=12, y from 0 to 10, z from 0 to 8.

- Left wall: y=0, x from 0 to 12, z from 0 to 8.

- Right wall: y=10, x from 0 to 12, z from 0 to 8.

The ceiling is z=8, and the floor is z=0.

The gecko is on a side wall. The problem says "side wall (10' by 8')", so since the side walls are 10 ft by 8 ft, that would correspond to the front and back walls? Wait, no. Wait, the front wall is 12 ft (length) by 8 ft (height), and the side walls would be the left and right walls, which are 10 ft (width) by 8 ft (height). So the gecko is on a side wall, which is either the left or right wall (y=0 or y=10). The problem states the gecko is one foot from the ceiling and one foot from the back wall. The back wall is x=12. So if the gecko is on the side wall (left or right), and one foot from the back wall, that would mean the side wall is adjacent to the back wall? Wait, that doesn't make sense because the side walls (left and right) are at y=0 and y=10, while the back wall is at x=12. So perhaps the gecko is on the back side? Wait, maybe the terminology is different.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using "side wall" to refer to any wall that is not the front or back. But the problem says the gecko is on a side wall, one foot from the ceiling and one foot from the back wall. So the side wall here must be the back wall? But the back wall is 12 ft by 8 ft. Wait, this is confusing.

Wait, let me read the problem again:

"The gecko is currently on a side wall (10' by 8'), one foot from the ceiling and one foot from the back wall (12' by 8''). The gecko spots a fly on the opposite side wall, one foot from the floor and one foot from the front wall".

Wait, the side wall is 10' by 8', so that's 10 feet in one dimension and 8 feet in height. The back wall is 12' by 8'', so 12 feet in length and 8 feet in height. So the side walls must be the ones that are 10 feet wide (front to back) and 8 feet tall. Therefore, the side walls are the front and back walls? Wait, no. Wait, the front wall is 12 feet long (x-axis) and 8 feet tall (z-axis). The side walls would be the left and right walls, which are 10 feet wide (y-axis) and 8 feet tall (z-axis). So the gecko is on a side wall, which is the left or right wall (y=0 or y=10). But the problem says the gecko is one foot from the ceiling and one foot from the back wall. The back wall is x=12. So if the gecko is on the left wall (y=0), being one foot from the back wall (x=12) would mean its x-coordinate is 11 (since 1 foot away from x=12). Similarly, being one foot from the ceiling (z=8) would mean its z-coordinate is 7 (since it's one foot below the ceiling). Its y-coordinate is 0 (left wall). So the gecko's position is (11, 0, 7).

The fly is on the opposite side wall, which would be the right wall (y=10). The fly is one foot from the floor (z=0) and one foot from the front wall (x=0). So the fly's position is (1, 10, 1).

Wait, that makes sense. So the gecko is on the left wall (y=0), at (11, 0, 7), and the fly is on the right wall (y=10), at (1, 10, 1).

Now, the gecko can walk across the ceiling (z=8) and the walls. So it can move along the left wall (y=0), the ceiling (x from 0 to 12, y=10, z=8), the right wall (y=10), the floor (z=0), etc.
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
If the gecko moves from the side wall to the ceiling, which is adjacent. The gecko is on the side wall, which is 10x8. The ceiling is 12x10. So if the gecko moves from its current position to the ceiling, it would have to traverse up the side wall 7 feet (since it's one foot from the ceiling). Then, once on the ceiling, which is 12 feet long and 10 feet wide, the gecko can move across the ceiling to the opposite side wall. But the fly is on the opposite side wall, one foot from the floor and one foot from the front wall. So, the fly's position is 1 foot from the floor (so 9 feet from the ceiling) and 1 foot from the front wall (which is 12 feet long, so 1 foot in from the back wall). 

Wait, maybe if we unfold the ceiling and the back wall into a plane, we can represent the gecko's path as a straight line.
</execution_2.3>

<execution_2.4>
Wait, but the ceiling is 12 feet long (length of the room) and 10 feet wide (width of the room). So if the gecko is on the side wall, which is 10 feet wide and 8 feet tall, moving up 7 feet to the ceiling, then across the ceiling to the front wall, which is 12 feet long. Then down the front wall 9 feet to reach the fly's position.

But let's calculate the total distance. Moving up 7 feet, then across the ceiling. If the gecko moves from its current position (1 foot from the ceiling on the side wall) up 7 feet to the ceiling, then across the ceiling. But the fly is on the opposite side wall, one foot from the floor and one foot from the front wall. So the fly's horizontal position relative to the ceiling would be 1 foot from the front wall (so 1 foot in from the back), and 1 foot from the floor, so 9 feet up from the floor (but since we're on the ceiling, that's 9 feet down from the ceiling). Wait, this is getting a bit tangled.

Alternatively, perhaps the gecko can crawl up the side wall, then across the back wall, then down the front wall. Let's see. The gecko is 1 foot from the ceiling and 1 foot from the back wall. So to get to the back wall, it needs to crawl 1 foot towards the back wall. Then, once on the back wall, it can crawl across to the front wall, which is 8 feet (height) + 1 foot (from back to front) = 9 feet? Wait, no. The back wall is 12 feet long (length of the room) and 8 feet tall. If the gecko is 1 foot from the back wall on the side wall, moving 1 foot towards the back wall would take it to the back wall. Then, from there, it can crawl across the back wall to the front wall. The back wall is 12 feet long, so if the fly is on the opposite side wall (the front wall), then the gecko would need to traverse the back wall's length plus the front wall's height? Wait, maybe not.

Alternatively, if we unfold the back wall and the front wall into a plane. The gecko is on the side wall, 1 foot from the back wall. If we unfold the back wall next to the side wall, then the gecko's path would be a straight line from its position to the fly's position, which is on the front wall. But I need to model this properly.

Maybe using the method of reflecting the room. In these shortest path problems on surfaces, sometimes reflecting the destination point across the walls allows us to compute a straight line in the extended plane. Since the gecko can only walk on the walls and ceiling, not through the air, we need to reflect the fly's position across the walls to find a straight-line path that corresponds to the gecko's actual path over the surfaces.

Let me try to formalize this. Let's model the room as a 3D coordinate system. Let's set the origin at the corner where the back wall (12' by 8'), the left wall (10' by 8'), and the floor (12' by 10') meet. So, coordinates are (x, y, z), where x is along the length (12 feet), y is along the width (10 feet), and z is the height (8 feet).

The gecko is on the side wall, which is the 10' by 8' wall. Since it's one foot from the back wall (x=12) and one foot from the ceiling (z=8). So, the gecko's position is (12 - 1, y, 8 - 1). But which y? The side wall is along the width (y-axis). Since the problem says it's on the side wall, but doesn't specify left or right. However, the fly is on the opposite side wall, so the gecko is on one side wall (say, y = 0), and the fly is on the opposite side wall (y = 10). Wait, actually, the problem says the gecko is on a side wall, one foot from the ceiling and one foot from the back wall. The side walls are 10' by 8', so the gecko is 1 foot from the ceiling (z=8 - 1 = 7) and 1 foot from the back wall (x=12 - 1 = 11). So the gecko's coordinates would be (11, y, 7). But what is y? Since it's on the side wall, which is 10 feet wide, y can be anywhere from 0 to 10. The problem doesn't specify, but since the fly is on the opposite side wall, which is also 10 feet wide, the gecko's y-coordinate is the same as the fly's y-coordinate? Wait, no. The fly is on the opposite side wall, so the gecko is on one side wall (y = some value), and the fly is on the opposite side wall (y = 10 - some value? ), but the problem says the fly is one foot from the floor and one foot from the front wall. The front wall is x=0, I think. Wait, no. Let's clarify the room's orientation.

Wait, maybe I need to assign directions more carefully. Let's define the room with x along the length (12 feet), y across the width (10 feet), and z up (8 feet). Let's say the gecko is on the back side wall (x=12), one foot from the ceiling (z=7) and one foot from the back wall (x=11). Wait, but x=12 is the back wall? Wait, maybe x=0 is the front wall, and x=12 is the back wall. So the gecko is 1 foot from the back wall (x=12), so it's at x=11. It's also one foot from the ceiling (z=7). Its position in y is not specified. Similarly, the fly is on the opposite side wall (x=0), one foot from the floor (z=1) and one foot from the front wall (x=1). So the fly's position is (1, y, 1). Wait, but the opposite side wall would be x=0, right? So the gecko is on x=12 (back wall), and the fly is on x=0 (front wall). The gecko is at (11, y, 7), and the fly is at (1, y, 1). But the problem says the gecko is on a side wall, not the back or front. Wait, maybe my coordinate system is mixed up.

Wait, the problem states: "the gecko is in a room that is 12 feet long, 10 feet wide and 8 feet tall. The gecko is currently on a side wall (10' by 8'), one foot from the ceiling and one foot from the back wall". So the side walls are the ones that are 10 feet by 8 feet. Therefore, the side walls are the ones that are 10 feet in width (y-axis) and 8 feet in height (z-axis). The length of the room is 12 feet (x-axis). So the side walls are at x=0 and x=12? Wait, no. Wait, the room is 12 feet long, 10 feet wide, 8 feet tall. So if we consider the side walls as the ones that are 10 feet wide (width is the y-axis) and 8 feet tall (z-axis), then the side walls are along the length (x-axis). So the side walls are at y=0 and y=10? Wait, that's conflicting with my previous thought.


-----

But let me check with another possible unfolding. Suppose we unfold the front and back walls along with the side walls. The gecko is on the side wall, 1 foot from the ceiling and 1 foot from the back wall. The fly is on the opposite side wall, 1 foot from the floor and 1 foot from the front wall. If we unfold the room such that the side wall, back wall, and front wall are all laid out in a plane, then the gecko's path can be represented as a straight line across these unfolded walls. Let me try to compute this.


-----

Another way to think about this is to model the room as a net. If we unfold the walls into a flat net, the gecko's path can be a straight line across multiple faces. Since the gecko can walk on the ceiling and walls, but not through the air, we need to consider the surfaces it can traverse.
</execution_2.4>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.4:
The key is to find the shortest path that connects the gecko's starting point to the fly's position, moving across the surfaces. To do this, we can "unfold" the 3D structure into 2D, such that the gecko's path becomes a straight line in the plane. The challenge is to determine the correct unfolding that allows the gecko's path to be represented as a straight line.
First, let's model the positions of the gecko and the fly in 3D coordinates. Let's assume the room is oriented with the x-axis along the length (12 feet), the y-axis along the width (10 feet), and the z-axis as height (8 feet). The gecko is on a side wall (y=10, since side walls are 10 feet wide and 8 feet tall), one foot from the ceiling (z=8 - 1 = 7) and one foot from the back wall (x=12 - 1 = 11). Therefore, the gecko's position is (11, 10, 7).
The fly is on the opposite side wall (y=0), one foot from the floor (z=1) and one foot from the front wall (x=0 + 1 = 1). Therefore, the fly's position is (1, 0, 1).

Now, the gecko needs to walk from (11, 10, 7) to (1, 0, 1) across the ceiling and walls. The possible paths involve moving along the walls and ceiling. To find the shortest path, we can consider unfolding the room into a 2D plane. The gecko's path will cross several walls, so we need to determine how to unfold the walls such that the gecko's path is a straight line in the plane.

One approach is to consider the gecko's movement from its starting position to the fly's position. The gecko can move up the side wall (from y=10 to y=0), across the ceiling (from x=11 to x=1), down the front wall (from z=7 to z=1), and across the front wall. However, since the gecko cannot fly, we need to find a path that stays on the surfaces.

Alternatively, we can use the method of reflections. By reflecting the fly's position across the ceiling and walls, we can create a virtual image that allows us to compute the shortest path as a straight line in the reflected coordinate system. However, since the gecko can only move across the ceiling and walls, not through the air, we need to reflect the fly's position across the relevant walls to find the shortest path.

Let me try to unfold the walls. If we unfold the ceiling (x=12) and the front wall (x=0) into the plane of the side wall (y=10), the gecko's path can be represented as a straight line from its position to the reflected position of the fly.

Alternatively, let's consider the gecko moving from the side wall (y=10) to the ceiling (x=12, y=10, z=8), then to the front wall (x=0, y=10, z=8), then down to the fly's position (x=1, y=0, z=1). However, this path would involve moving up the side wall, across the ceiling, down the front wall, and across the front wall. However, this is a 3D path, and we need to find the shortest path on the surfaces.

Another way to approach this is to "unfold" the room into a 2D plane by laying out the relevant walls and ceiling. Let's consider unfolding the side wall (y=10), the ceiling (x=12, y=10, z=8), the front wall (x=0, y=10, z=8), and the fly's position. However, this might not be straightforward. Alternatively, we can consider the gecko's path as moving from its current position on the side wall to the fly's position on the opposite side wall, crossing the ceiling and the front wall.

To compute this, let's consider the gecko's movement as moving from (11, 10, 7) to (1, 0, 1). To unfold the room, we can imagine "flattening" the walls into a plane. Let's first consider the side wall (y=10) and the front wall (x=0). If we unfold the front wall next to the side wall, the gecko's path would cross both walls. However, the fly is on the opposite side wall (y=0), so we need to unfold the path across multiple walls.

Alternatively, let's consider the gecko moving up the side wall (from y=10 to y=0), across the ceiling (from x=11 to x=1), and down the front wall (from z=7 to z=1). However, this involves moving through different dimensions. To represent this as a straight line, we need to find a way to unfold the 3D path into 2D.

Another approach is to parameterize the gecko's path. Let's consider the gecko moving from (11, 10, 7) to (1, 0, 1). The displacement in x is -10 (from 11 to 1), displacement in y is -10 (from 10 to 0), and displacement in z is -6 (from 7 to 1). However, since the gecko is constrained to move across the walls and ceiling, we need to find a path that covers these displacements while staying on the surfaces.

Alternatively, we can model this as a 3D problem but projected onto 2D by considering the surfaces. For example, moving from the side wall to the ceiling can be considered as moving on a plane that includes the side wall and ceiling. Similarly, moving from the ceiling to the front wall is another plane. However, calculating the shortest path across multiple planes is complex.

A better approach is to use the method of unfolding. Let's consider the gecko's path from its starting position to the fly's position, crossing the ceiling and the front wall. To unfold these into a plane, we can reflect the fly's position across the ceiling and front wall. Let me attempt this.

First, the ceiling is 12 feet long (x-axis) and 10 feet wide (y-axis). The fly is on the front wall (x=0) at (0, 10, 1). To unfold the ceiling and front wall into a plane, we can reflect the fly's position across the front wall. However, reflecting across the front wall (x=0) would invert the x-coordinate. Alternatively, since the gecko is moving from the side wall (y=10) to the ceiling (x=12, y=10, z=8), then to the front wall (x=0, y=10, z=8), and then to the fly's position (1, 0, 1), we can model this by unfolding the ceiling and front wall into a plane.

Alternatively, let's consider the gecko's path as moving from (11, 10, 7) up the side wall to the ceiling at (11, 10, 8), then across the ceiling to the front wall at (0, 10, 8), then down the front wall to (0, 10, 1), and then across the front wall to (1, 0, 1). However, this path would require moving through the air from (0, 10, 1) to (1, 0, 1), which is not allowed. Therefore, the gecko must stay on the surfaces.

Alternatively, the gecko can crawl up the side wall to the ceiling, then across the ceiling to the front wall, then down the front wall to the fly's position. The total distance would be the sum of the vertical distance up the side wall, the horizontal distance across the ceiling, and the vertical distance down the front wall. However, calculating this requires knowing the path's layout.

Alternatively, perhaps the shortest path is achieved by unfolding the side wall, ceiling, and front wall into a single plane. Let me try to visualize this. If we unfold the side wall (y=10), the ceiling (x=12, y=10, z=8), and the front wall (x=0, y=10, z=8) into a plane, the gecko's path from (11, 10, 7) to (1, 0, 1) can be represented as a straight line in this unfolded plane.

To do this, let's consider the side wall as the starting point. The side wall is at y=10, x from 0 to 12, z from 0 to 8. The ceiling is attached to the top of the side wall (z=8). The front wall is at x=0, y from 0 to 10, z from 0 to 8. If we unfold the ceiling and front wall next to the side wall, the gecko's path can be represented as a straight line from (11, 10, 7) to (1, 0, 1) in this combined plane.

However, to compute this, we need to adjust the coordinates. Let's flatten the side wall, ceiling, and front wall into a 2D plane. The issue is that the front wall is at x=0, so when unfolded, it would be adjacent to the side wall. Alternatively, perhaps we can model the entire path as moving across multiple walls, each time reflecting the coordinate system.

Alternatively, let's consider the gecko's movement as moving across the side wall, then the ceiling, then the front wall, and finally to the fly. To represent this as a straight line, we can reflect the fly's position across these surfaces.

Alternatively, let's use a coordinate system where the gecko's path is represented as moving in a 2D plane by unfolding the necessary walls. Let's consider that the gecko needs to move from (11, 10, 7) to (1, 0, 1). To do this, the gecko must traverse the side wall (from y=10 to y=0), the ceiling (from x=11 to x=1), the front wall (from z=8 to z=1), and the fly's position. However, since this is 3D, we need to find a way to represent this in 2D.

Another approach is to calculate the horizontal and vertical distances the gecko needs to cover. The gecko is 1 foot from the back wall (x=11) and 7 feet below the ceiling (z=7). The fly is 1 foot from the front wall (x=1) and 1 foot above the floor (z=1). The gecko needs to move horizontally from x=11 to x=1 (a distance of 10 feet) and vertically from z=7 to z=1 (a distance of 6 feet). However, since the gecko can move across the ceiling and walls, the actual path would be a combination of horizontal and vertical movements.

Wait, but the gecko can move along the side wall (vertically and horizontally), then across the ceiling (horizontally), then down the front wall (vertically). So the total path would consist of three segments: up the side wall, across the ceiling, and down the front wall. However, the problem states the gecko can only walk across the ceiling and walls, so it can move along the surfaces, but not through the interior of the room.
