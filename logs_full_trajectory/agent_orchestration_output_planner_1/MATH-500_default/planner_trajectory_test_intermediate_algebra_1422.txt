Okay, so I need to find the number of different possible rational roots for this polynomial: 2x⁴ + a₃x³ + a₂x² + a₁x + 1, where the coefficients a₃, a₂, a₁ are integers. Hmm, let's start by recalling the Rational Root Theorem because that seems relevant here. The theorem states that any possible rational root, expressed in lowest terms p/q, must have p as a factor of the constant term and q as a factor of the leading coefficient. 

In this polynomial, the constant term is 1, and the leading coefficient is 2. So, the possible values for p (the numerator) are the factors of 1, which are ±1. The possible values for q (the denominator) are the factors of 2, which are ±1, ±2. But since we want the rational roots in their lowest terms, we can consider positive denominators, right?
Because negative denominators can be absorbed into the numerator's sign. So, the possible rational roots would be ±1, ±1/2.

Wait, but let me check that again. If p can be ±1 and q can be 1 or 2, then the possible rational roots are ±1/1 and ±1/2.
So that's four possible rational roots: 1, -1, 1/2, -1/2.

But hold on, the problem says "the number of different possible rational roots of this polynomial". But the coefficients a₃, a₂, a₁ are variables here, meaning they can be any integers.
So, the polynomial isn't fixed; it can have different coefficients. Therefore, the possible rational roots depend on these coefficients. Wait, no, actually, the Rational Root Theorem applies to any polynomial with integer coefficients. So regardless of the values of a₃, a₂, a₁, the possible rational roots are still constrained by the constant term and leading coefficient. Because the possible rational roots are determined by the polynomial's coefficients, which in this case are fixed except for a₃, a₂, a₁. Wait, but even though a₃, a₂, a₁ can vary, the constant term is 1 and the leading coefficient is 2, so the possible rational roots are still ±1 and ±1/2. So regardless of what a₃, a₂, a₁ are, the possible rational roots can only be those four. Therefore, the number of different possible rational roots is 4.

Based on execution_1:
But wait, maybe there's a catch here. Let me think again. Suppose that for some coefficients a₃, a₂, a₁, some of these possible roots are actually roots of the polynomial. But the question is asking for the number of different possible rational roots, not the number of roots that are actually possible for some polynomial. Wait, no, the wording is "the number of different possible rational roots of this polynomial". But since the polynomial is given with coefficients a₃, a₂, a₁ which are integers, but not fixed, maybe we need to consider all possible rational roots that could arise from any such polynomial. But according to the Rational Root Theorem, all possible rational roots must be of the form ±1, ±1/2, regardless of the coefficients. Because the theorem depends only on the leading coefficient and the constant term. So even if the coefficients in between change, the possible rational roots are still determined by the leading and constant terms. Therefore, the possible rational roots are fixed as those four options. So the number of different possible rational roots is 4.

But let me make sure I'm not missing something. Let's test each possible root.

<prompt_2.1> Test each possible rational root to ensure they are indeed possible. </prompt_2.1>

Is there any other possible rational root? For example, could 2 or -2 be a root?

<prompt_2.2> Check if other possible rational roots like 2, -2, 1/4, -1/4 could exist. </prompt_2.2>

<execution_2.1>
Let's check if 1 is a possible root. If we plug x=1 into the polynomial, we get 2(1)^4 + a₃(1)^3 + a₂(1)^2 + a₁(1) + 1 = 2 + a₃ + a₂ + a₁ + 1 = a₃ + a₂ + a₁ + 3. For this to be zero, we need a₃ + a₂ + a₁ = -3. Since a₃, a₂, a₁ are integers, this is possible. For example, if all three are -1, then their sum is -3. So x=1 is a possible rational root. Similarly, x=-1: plugging in, we get 2(-1)^4 + a₃(-1)^3 + a₂(-1)^2 + a₁(-1) + 1 = 2 - a₃ + a₂ - a₁ + 1 = (2 + 1) + (-a₃ + a₂ - a₁) = 3 + (-a₃ + a₂ - a₁). To make this zero, we need -a₃ + a₂ - a₁ = -3, which is equivalent to a₃ - a₂ + a₁ = 3. Since integers can satisfy this, for example, a₃=3, a₂=0, a₁=0, then the equation becomes 3 - 0 + 0 = 3. So x=-1 is also a possible root.

Now, x=1/2: plugging into the polynomial, we get 2*(1/2)^4 + a₃*(1/2)^3 + a₂*(1/2)^2 + a₁*(1/2) + 1. Let's compute each term:

2*(1/16) = 2/16 = 1/8

a₃*(1/8) = a₃/8

a₂*(1/4) = a₂/4

a₁*(1/2) = a₁/2

Plus 1.

So total is 1/8 + a₃/8 + a₂/4 + a₁/2 + 1. Let's combine terms:

1 + 1/8 = 9/8

Then a₃/8 + a₂/4 + a₁/2 = (a₃ + 2a₂ + 4a₁)/8

So total expression is 9/8 + (a₃ + 2a₂ + 4a₁)/8 = (9 + a₃ + 2a₂ + 4a₁)/8. For this to be zero, the numerator must be zero: 9 + a₃ + 2a₂ + 4a₁ = 0. Since a₃, a₂, a₁ are integers, this equation can be satisfied. For example, let's choose a₁ = -2, a₂ = -1, a₃ = -3. Then 9 + (-3) + 2*(-1) + 4*(-2) = 9 -3 -2 -8 = -4 ≠ 0. Hmm, that's not zero. Let me pick different values. Suppose we set a₁ = -1, a₂ = -1, then 9 + a₃ + 2*(-1) + 4*(-1) = 9 + a₃ -2 -4 = 3 + a₃. So set a₃ = -3: 3 + (-3) = 0. So yes, if a₃=-3, a₂=-1, a₁=-1, then the numerator is 0. Therefore, x=1/2 is a possible root.

Similarly, x=-1/2: plugging into the polynomial:

2*(-1/2)^4 + a₃*(-1/2)^3 + a₂*(-1/2)^2 + a₁*(-1/2) + 1.

Compute each term:

2*(1/16) = 1/8

a₃*(-1/8) = -a₃/8

a₂*(1/4) = a₂/4

a₁*(-1/2) = -a₁/2

Plus 1.

Total: 1/8 - a₃/8 + a₂/4 - a₁/2 + 1. Combine terms:

1 + 1/8 = 9/8

Then (-a₃/8 + a₂/4 - a₁/2) = (-a₃ + 2a₂ -4a₁)/8

Total expression: 9/8 + (-a₃ + 2a₂ -4a₁)/8 = (9 -a₃ + 2a₂ -4a₁)/8. Setting numerator to zero: 9 -a₃ + 2a₂ -4a₁ = 0. So, -a₃ + 2a₂ -4a₁ = -9. Let's choose a₃=9, a₂=0, a₁=0. Then -9 +0 -0 = -9. So yes, that works. Therefore, x=-1/2 is also a possible root.

Let's test 2. If x=2 were a root, then substituting into the polynomial gives 2*(16) + a₃*(8) + a₂*(4) + a₁*(2) +1 = 0. That would require 32 + 8a₃ + 4a₂ + 2a₁ +1 = 0, so 33 + 8a₃ + 4a₂ + 2a₁ = 0. Since a₃, a₂, a₁ are integers, this equation could hold for some integers. For example, if a₃ = -4, a₂ = -4, a₁ = 1, then 8*(-4) = -32, 4*(-4) = -16, 2*(1) = 2. So 33 -32 -16 +2 = -13 ≠ 0. Hmm, maybe another set. Let's see, 8a₃ +4a₂ +2a₁ = -33. Let's divide both sides by 1: 8a₃ +4a₂ +2a₁ = -33. The left side is even (since 8a₃ is even, 4a₂ is even, 2a₁ is even), but the right side is odd. So this equation has no solution. Therefore, x=2 cannot be a root. Similarly, x=-2: substituting gives 2*(16) + a₃*(-8) + a₂*(4) + a₁*(-2) +1 = 0. So 32 -8a₃ +4a₂ -2a₁ +1 = 0 → 33 -8a₃ +4a₂ -2a₁ = 0. Rearranged: -8a₃ +4a₂ -2a₁ = -33. Multiply both sides by -1: 8a₃ -4a₂ +2a₁ = 33. Again, left side is even (8a₃ is even, -4a₂ is even, 2a₁ is even), right side is odd. No solution. So x=2 and x=-2 cannot be roots. 

What about 1/4 or -1/4? Let's test 1/4. Substitute x=1/4: 2*(1/4)^4 + a₃*(1/4)^3 + a₂*(1/4)^2 + a₁*(1/4) +1 = 0. Calculating each term: 2*(1/256) = 1/128, a₃*(1/64), a₂*(1/16), a₁*(1/4), and 1. So adding up: 1/128 + a₃/64 + a₂/16 + a₁/4 +1 = 0. Multiply both sides by 128 to eliminate denominators: 1 + 2a₃ + 8a₂ + 32a₁ + 128 = 0 → 129 + 2a₃ + 8a₂ + 32a₁ = 0. So 2a₃ + 8a₂ + 32a₁ = -129. The left side is even (2a₃ is even, 8a₂ is even, 32a₁ is even), but the right side is odd. Again, no solution. So 1/4 can't be a root. Similarly, -1/4: substitute x=-1/4. Then each term becomes: 2*(-1/4)^4 = 2*(1/256) = 1/128, a₃*(-1/4)^3 = -a₃/64, a₂*(-1/4)^2 = a₂/16, a₁*(-1/4) = -a₁/4, and 1. So adding up: 1/128 - a₃/64 + a₂/16 - a₁/4 +1 = 0. Multiply by 128: 1 - 2a₃ + 8a₂ - 32a₁ + 128 = 0 → 129 -2a₃ +8a₂ -32a₁ =0. So -2a₃ +8a₂ -32a₁ = -129. Left side is even (each term is even), right side is odd. No solution. Therefore, 1/4 and -1/4 can't be roots either.

Based on execution_2:
So even if we vary a₃, a₂, a₁ over all integers, the possible rational roots are only those four. Therefore, the answer should be 4.

But wait, let me check if there's a case where maybe two of these possible roots coincide, but I don't think so. 1, -1, 1/2, -1/2 are all distinct.

. For example, 1 is different from -1, which is different from 1/2 and -1/2. So four distinct possible rational roots. 

But just to be thorough, let's make sure that each of these is indeed possible. As we saw earlier, by choosing appropriate coefficients, each of these roots can be made to satisfy the equation. Therefore, all four are possible.

Based on execution_3:
Therefore, the number of different possible rational roots is 4. 

Wait, but the problem says "the number of different possible rational roots of this polynomial".
If the polynomial is allowed to have any integer coefficients (a₃, a₂, a₁), then the possible rational roots are indeed those four. However, if the coefficients were fixed, then the possible rational roots would be among those four depending on the coefficients. But since the coefficients can be any integers, then all four of them are possible. Therefore, the answer is 4.
