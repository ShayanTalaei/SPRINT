Okay, so I need to find the equation of the line given in parametric form and express it in the slope-intercept form, which is y = mx + b. The problem gives the parametric equations as:

<prompt_1.1> Identify the parametric equations from the given problem and determine what needs to be converted. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
[ x ]   [8] + t [2]
[ y ]   [-1]     [3]

So, the line is parameterized by t, and each point (x, y) on the line is given by those equations. The goal is to convert this into the form y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. Then, I need to find the ordered pair (m, b).

Based on execution_1.1:
First, I remember that parametric equations express x and y in terms of a parameter, which here is t. To convert this into the Cartesian form (y = mx + b), I need to eliminate the parameter t. How do I do that?

Well, usually, you can solve one of the equations for t and substitute into the other equation.
Let me try that.

Looking at the x equation: x = 8 + 2t.

<prompt_2.1> Solve the x equation for t and substitute into the y equation to find the relationship between x and y. </prompt_2.1>

Alternatively, maybe I can use another method to verify. For example, using the direction vector.

<prompt_2.2> Use the direction vector and a point to find the slope-intercept form of the line. </prompt_2.2>

Alternatively, maybe I can pick two points from the parametric equations and find the equation. Let's see.

<prompt_2.3> Calculate the slope using two different values of t and confirm the slope. </prompt_2.3>

Another way to check: use the point-direction form.

<prompt_2.4> Use the point-direction form to find the slope-intercept form of the line. </prompt_2.4>

I can solve for t here. Subtract 8 from both sides: x - 8 = 2t. Then divide both sides by 2: t = (x - 8)/2.

Now, substitute this expression for t into the y equation. The y equation is y = -1 + 3t. So substituting t gives:

y = -1 + 3*( (x - 8)/2 )

Let me compute that step by step. First, multiply 3 by (x - 8)/2:

3*(x - 8)/2 = (3x - 24)/2

So, y = -1 + (3x - 24)/2

Now, to combine the constants, I need to have a common denominator. Let's convert -1 into halves: -1 = -2/2

Therefore, y = -2/2 + (3x - 24)/2 = (3x - 24 - 2)/2 = (3x - 26)/2

Which can be written as y = (3/2)x - 13

The direction vector is [2, 3], which means for every increase of 2 in x, y increases by 3. Therefore, the slope m is rise over run, which is 3/2. Wait, but that's the same as before. So slope is 3/2. Then, using the point (8, -1), plug into y = (3/2)x + b. Then, -1 = (3/2)(8) + b. Calculate (3/2)*8 = 12. So, -1 = 12 + b => b = -13. So same result.
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
If t = 0, then the point is (8, -1). If t = 1, then x = 8 + 2(1) = 10, y = -1 + 3(1) = 2. So, another point is (10, 2). Let's compute the slope between these two points.

Slope m = (2 - (-1)) / (10 - 8) = 3 / 2. So, same result. Then, using point-slope form with (8, -1):

y - (-1) = (3/2)(x - 8)

Simplifies to y + 1 = (3/2)x - 12. Then, subtract 1: y = (3/2)x -13. So, same answer. So, that's good.
</execution_2.3>

<execution_2.4>
The parametric equations can be seen as starting at (8, -1) and moving in the direction (2, 3). So, the direction vector is (2, 3), which means the slope is 3/2, same as before. Then, using point-slope form: y - (-1) = (3/2)(x - 8). Which simplifies to y + 1 = (3/2)x - 12, leading to y = (3/2)x -13.

Based on execution_2.1:
Wait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the arithmetic.

<prompt_3.1> Verify the previous calculation for y to ensure no arithmetic mistakes. </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
Starting from y = -1 + 3*( (x - 8)/2 )

Let me compute 3*(x - 8)/2. That is indeed (3x - 24)/2. Then, adding -1, which is -2/2, gives (3x - 24 - 2)/2 = (3x - 26)/2. So, yes, that's correct. Then, dividing 3x by 2 gives (3/2)x, and -26 divided by 2 is -13.

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
Let me verify by plugging in a value of t to see if both equations give the same point. Let's take t = 0.

<prompt_4.1> Verify the derived equation by plugging in t = 0 and t = 1. </prompt_4.1>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
From parametric equations: x = 8 + 2*0 = 8, y = -1 + 3*0 = -1. From the derived equation y = (3/2)x -13: plug in x = 8, y = (3/2)*8 -13 = 12 -13 = -1. Correct.

Now, take t = 1. Parametric: x = 8 + 2*1 = 10, y = -1 + 3*1 = 2. From the equation: y = (3/2)*10 -13 = 15 -13 = 2. Correct.

Another check with t = 2. Parametric: x = 8 + 4 = 12, y = -1 + 6 = 5. Equation: y = (3/2)*12 -13 = 18 -13 = 5. Correct. So, seems like the conversion is correct.

<Final_answer>
Therefore, the ordered pair $(m,b)$ is $\boxed{\left( \frac{3}{2}, -13 \right)}$.
