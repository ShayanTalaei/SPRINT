<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to figure out how many ways the letters of the word ELLIPSE can be arranged. Let me start by recalling that when dealing with permutations of letters in a word with repeating characters, the formula involves factorials divided by the product of the factorials of the counts of each repeating letter. 

First, I should probably write down the word and count how many letters there are in total. ELLIPSE has 7 letters. Let me check: E, L, L, I, P, S, E. Yep, that's 7 letters.

Now, I need to identify which letters are repeating and how many times. Let's list them out:

<prompt_1.1> Identify the repeating letters in the word ELLIPSE and calculate the total number of permutations without considering repetitions. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
- E appears twice.
- L appears twice.
- The other letters (I, P, S) each appear once.
- So, the total number of letters is 7, with E and L each repeated twice, and the rest are unique.
</execution_1.1>

Based on execution_1.1:
Therefore, if all the letters were distinct, the number of arrangements would be 7! (which is 7 factorial).
But since we have repetitions, we need to adjust for that. The formula for permutations with repeated elements is:

Total arrangements = 7! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk! )

<prompt_2.1> Apply the permutation formula for repeated elements to calculate the number of arrangements for ELLIPSE. </prompt_2.1>

Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any other repeating letters.
Looking at ELLIPSE again: E, L, L, I, P, S, E. That's E twice, L twice, and the rest unique. So three letters repeated twice each? Wait, no. Wait, E and L are each repeated twice, and the others are single.

<prompt_2.2> Re-evaluate the calculation of factorials and confirm the simplification. </prompt_2.2>
-----

But let me confirm once more. Alternatively, suppose I thought of it as first choosing positions for the E's and then the L's and then the rest.

<prompt_2.3> Explore an alternative method to calculate the permutations of ELLIPSE. </prompt_2.3>

Alternatively, if I tried to compute 7! / (2! * 2! ), that's 5040 / 4 = 1260. So same answer.
Therefore, I think that's the correct number.

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Where n1, n2, .... nk are the number of times each letter repeats. 

In this case, we have two E's and two L's. So the formula becomes:

Total arrangements = 7! / (2! * 2! )
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
So total duplicates are two letters each repeated twice. So the denominator would be 2! for E and 2! for L. Therefore, 7! divided by (2! * 2! ).
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
There are 7 letters. Choose 2 positions for E's: C(7,2). Then, from the remaining 5 letters, choose 2 positions for L's: C(5,2). Then, the remaining 3 letters (I, P, S) can be arranged in 3! ways. So total number of arrangements would be C(7,2) * C(5,2) * 3! .

Compute that: C(7,2) is 21, C(5,2) is 10, and 3! is 6. Multiply them together: 21 * 10 = 210, 210 * 6 = 1260.
</execution_2.3>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Let me compute that.
7! is 7×6×5×4×3×2×1, which is 5040. Then, 2! is 2×1=2, so we have two 2! in the denominator, which is 2×2=4. Therefore, 5040 divided by 4.
Let me do that division: 5040 ÷ 4. Well, 5000 ÷ 4 is 1250, and 40 ÷ 4 is 10, so total is 1250 + 10 = 1260.
-----

So 7! / (2! * 2! ) = 5040 / 4 = 1260. 

Therefore, the number of distinct arrangements is 1260.
-----

Based on execution_2.3:
That matches the previous result, which is reassuring. So both methods give 1260, so that seems correct.
Therefore, the answer should be 1260.

No prompt to execute.

<Final_answer>
Therefore, the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word ELLIPSE is $\boxed{1260}$.
