<Plan_1>
Okay, let's see. I need to find the greatest possible value of the expression \(\left(a + \frac{1}{b}\right)\left(\frac{1}{b} - a\right)\) given that \( -6 \leq a \leq -2 \) and \( 3 \leq b \leq 5 \). Hmm, alright. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.

First, the expression is a product of two terms: \( \left(a + \frac{1}{b}\right) \) and \( \left(\frac{1}{b} - a\right) \). Maybe I can simplify this expression before trying to maximize it. Let me write it out:
\[
\left(a + \frac{1}{b}\right)\left(\frac{1}{b} - a\right)
\]
If I expand this, it might become something simpler. Let's do the multiplication:
\[
a \cdot \frac{1}{b} - a \cdot a + \frac{1}{b} \cdot \frac{1}{b} - \frac{1}{b} \cdot a
\]
Simplifying each term:
- First term: \( \frac{a}{b} \)
- Second term: \( -a^2 \)
- Third term: \( \frac{1}{b^2} \)
- Fourth term: \( -\frac{a}{b} \)

So when we combine all terms:
\[
\frac{a}{b} - a^2 + \frac{1}{b^2} - \frac{a}{b} = -a^2 + \frac{1}{b^2}
\]
Wait, the \( \frac{a}{b} \) and \( -\frac{a}{b} \) terms cancel each other out! So the original expression simplifies to \( -a^2 + \frac{1}{b^2} \).

That's a big simplification. So instead of dealing with the product of two binomials, it's just \( \frac{1}{b^2} - a^2 \). Therefore, the problem reduces to maximizing \( \frac{1}{b^2} - a^2 \) given the constraints on \( a \) and \( b \).

Now, since we need to maximize \( \frac{1}{b^2} - a^2 \), let's analyze each term separately.

<prompt_1.1> Analyze the simplified expression \(\frac{1}{b^2} - a^2\) to determine how to maximize it. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
First, \( \frac{1}{b^2} \): since \( b \) is between 3 and 5, \( \frac{1}{b^2} \) will be largest when \( b \) is smallest because as \( b \) increases, \( \frac{1}{b^2} \) decreases. So to maximize \( \frac{1}{b^2} \), we should take the smallest \( b \), which is 3. Therefore, the maximum value of \( \frac{1}{b^2} \) is \( \frac{1}{9} \).

On the other hand, \( -a^2 \): since \( a \) is negative (between -6 and -2), squaring it will make it positive, and the negative sign in front makes it negative. To maximize the entire expression \( \frac{1}{b^2} - a^2 \), we need to minimize \( a^2 \) because it's being subtracted. Alternatively, minimizing \( a^2 \) would mean making \( |a| \) as small as possible. Since \( a \) is negative, the smallest \( |a| \) is the largest \( a \). Wait, because \( a \) is between -6 and -2, so the largest \( a \) is -2. Therefore, to minimize \( a^2 \), we take \( a = -2 \), which gives \( a^2 = 4 \). If we take \( a = -6 \), \( a^2 = 36 \), which is much larger.

</Execution_1>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Putting this together, if we take \( b = 3 \) and \( a = -2 \), then the expression becomes \( \frac{1}{9} - (-2)^2 = \frac{1}{9} - 4 = \frac{1}{9} - \frac{36}{9} = -\frac{35}{9} \).

But wait, that's a negative number. However, maybe there's a combination where the expression is positive? Let me check.

<prompt_2.1> Verify if the expression can yield a positive value by considering the constraints on \(a\) and \(b\). </prompt_2.1>
-----

Wait, but let me check another approach. Let's consider the original expression before simplification: \( \left(a + \frac{1}{b}\right)\left(\frac{1}{b} - a\right) \). This looks like the difference of squares: \( (x + y)(y - x) = y^2 - x^2 \).

<prompt_2.2> Re-evaluate the expression using the difference of squares and confirm the simplification. </prompt_2.2>
-----

But let me just test with another point. Suppose a is -2 and b is 5.

<prompt_2.3> Test additional points to confirm the maximum value of the expression. </prompt_2.3>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
If both \( \frac{1}{b^2} \) and \( a^2 \) are positive, but we need their difference to be as large as possible. If \( \frac{1}{b^2} \) is maximized and \( a^2 \) is minimized, then their difference is maximized. However, in the previous calculation, we got a negative number. But maybe if \( \frac{1}{b^2} \) is large enough compared to \( a^2 \), the difference could be positive. Let's see.

For the expression \( \frac{1}{b^2} - a^2 \) to be positive, we need \( \frac{1}{b^2} > a^2 \). Let's check if that's possible given the ranges of \( a \) and \( b \).

Given \( a \) is between -6 and -2, so \( |a| \) is between 2 and 6, so \( a^2 \) is between 4 and 36. \( b \) is between 3 and 5, so \( \frac{1}{b^2} \) is between \( \frac{1}{25} \) (when b=5) and \( \frac{1}{9} \) (when b=3). So \( \frac{1}{b^2} \) is at most \( \frac{1}{9} \), which is approximately 0.111, and \( a^2 \) is at least 4. Therefore, \( \frac{1}{b^2} - a^2 \) is always negative because 0.111 - 4 = -3.888, and it gets more negative as \( a^2 \) increases or \( \frac{1}{b^2} \) decreases.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
If we let \( x = a \) and \( y = \frac{1}{b} \), then the expression simplifies to \( \left(\frac{1}{b}\right)^2 - a^2 \), which is the same as \( \frac{1}{b^2} - a^2 \). So that's another way to see the simplification. Therefore, the expression is indeed \( \frac{1}{b^2} - a^2 \).

So, to maximize \( \frac{1}{b^2} - a^2 \), we need to maximize \( \frac{1}{b^2} \) and minimize \( a^2 \). Since \( \frac{1}{b^2} \) is maximized when \( b \) is minimized (i.e., \( b = 3 \)), and \( a^2 \) is minimized when \( |a| \) is minimized (i.e., \( a = -2 \)), as previously thought. Therefore, substituting these values gives \( \frac{1}{9} - 4 = -\frac{35}{9} \).
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
Then the expression is ( -2 + 1/5 )( 1/5 - (-2) ) = (-2 + 0.2)(0.2 + 2) = (-1.8)(2.2) = -4. So that's worse. If a is -6 and b is 3: ( -6 + 1/3 )( 1/3 - (-6) ) = (-6 + 1/3)(6 + 1/3) = (-5.666...)(6.333... ) which is negative and large in magnitude. If a is -6 and b is 5: (-6 + 1/5)(1/5 - (-6)) = (-5.8)(6.2) = -36.16, which is even more negative.
</execution_2.3>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
But wait, maybe there's a mistake here? Let me check again. Suppose if \( a \) is negative, but when we square it, it's positive. So \( a^2 \) is positive, and \( \frac{1}{b^2} \) is positive, so their difference is positive or negative depending on which is larger.
But as we saw, \( \frac{1}{b^2} \) is at most 1/9 â‰ˆ 0.111, while \( a^2 \) is at least 4. So \( \frac{1}{b^2} - a^2 \) is always negative. Therefore, the maximum value would be the least negative value, i.e., the one closest to zero.

Wait, but the problem says "greatest possible value", which would be the maximum, even if it's negative. So in that case, we need the maximum value, which would be the one closest to zero. So to maximize \( \frac{1}{b^2} - a^2 \), we need to make \( \frac{1}{b^2} \) as large as possible and \( a^2 \) as small as possible. So that would be \( b = 3 \) (maximizing \( \frac{1}{b^2} \)) and \( a = -2 \) (minimizing \( a^2 \)), leading to \( \frac{1}{9} - 4 = -\frac{35}{9} \).

But let me check another combination.

<prompt_3.1> Re-evaluate the expression by considering different combinations of \(a\) and \(b\) to confirm the maximum value. </prompt_3.1>

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the simplification. Let me check again. The original expression is \( \left(a + \frac{1}{b}\right)\left(\frac{1}{b} - a\right) \). Let's multiply it out again:

<prompt_3.2> Reconfirm the simplification of the expression and verify the approach to ensure correctness. </prompt_3.2>
-----

Based on execution_2.2:
But wait, let's confirm this. Let me check another combination: suppose \( a = -2 \) and \( b = 3 \), then \( \frac{1}{b^2} - a^2 = \frac{1}{9} - 4 = -\frac{35}{9} \approx -3.888 \). If \( a = -3 \) (but wait, \( a \) can't be -3, it's between -6 and -2), but let's take \( a = -2.5 \), then \( a^2 = 6.25 \), so \( \frac{1}{9} - 6.25 \approx -6.055 \), which is worse. So indeed, the closer \( a \) is to zero (i.e., the larger in value since \( a \) is negative), the smaller \( a^2 \) is. Therefore, \( a = -2 \) gives the minimal \( a^2 \).
-----

Based on execution_2.3:
Alternatively, is there a possibility that the expression could be positive? Let's see.

<prompt_3.3> Perform a final verification to ensure no possibility of a positive expression exists. </prompt_3.3>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
Suppose \( a = -2 \) and \( b = 5 \). Then the expression is \( \frac{1}{25} - 4 = \frac{1}{25} - \frac{100}{25} = -\frac{99}{25} = -3.96 \). Hmm, that's actually more negative than -35/9. Let's compute -35/9: 35 divided by 9 is approximately 3.888...., so -35/9 is approximately -3.888. So -3.96 is more negative. So indeed, using \( b = 3 \) and \( a = -2 \) gives a less negative (i.e., larger) value than using \( b = 5 \).

What if we take \( a = -2 \) and \( b = 4 \)? Then \( \frac{1}{16} - 4 = 0.0625 - 4 = -3.9375 \), which is still more negative than -35/9. So yes, the maximum occurs when \( b \) is minimized and \( a \) is maximized (closest to zero).
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
First term: \( a \times \frac{1}{b} = \frac{a}{b} \)

Second term: \( a \times (-a) = -a^2 \)

Third term: \( \frac{1}{b} \times \frac{1}{b} = \frac{1}{b^2} \)

Fourth term: \( \frac{1}{b} \times (-a) = -\frac{a}{b} \)

So adding all terms: \( \frac{a}{b} - a^2 + \frac{1}{b^2} - \frac{a}{b} \). The \( \frac{a}{b} \) and \( -\frac{a}{b} \) terms do cancel out, leaving \( -a^2 + \frac{1}{b^2} \). So that's correct. Therefore, the expression simplifies to \( \frac{1}{b^2} - a^2 \).

Therefore, the problem reduces to maximizing \( \frac{1}{b^2} - a^2 \) with given constraints. Since both \( \frac{1}{b^2} \) and \( -a^2 \) are involved, we need to maximize the first term and minimize the second term. Wait, but \( -a^2 \) is equivalent to minimizing \( a^2 \). So yes, to maximize the entire expression, we need the maximum of \( \frac{1}{b^2} \) and the minimum of \( a^2 \).

Therefore, \( \frac{1}{b^2} \) is maximized when \( b \) is minimized (since \( b \) is in the denominator, smaller \( b \) makes \( \frac{1}{b^2} \) larger). The minimum \( b \) is 3, so \( \frac{1}{9} \). Then \( a^2 \) is minimized when \( |a| \) is minimized. Since \( a \) is between -6 and -2, the smallest \( |a| \) is 2 (when \( a = -2 \)), so \( a^2 = 4 \). Therefore, substituting these values gives \( \frac{1}{9} - 4 = \frac{1 - 36}{9} = -\frac{35}{9} \).
</execution_3.2>

<execution_3.3>
Suppose \( \frac{1}{b^2} > a^2 \). Then \( \frac{1}{b} > |a| \). But since \( b \geq 3 \), \( \frac{1}{b} \leq \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.333 \). And \( |a| \geq 2 \). So \( \frac{1}{b} \) is at most 0.333, which is less than 2. Therefore, \( \frac{1}{b} < |a| \), so \( \frac{1}{b^2} < a^2 \). Therefore, \( \frac{1}{b^2} - a^2 \) is always negative. Therefore, the expression is always negative, and we need to find the maximum (least negative) value.

Therefore, the maximum value is indeed \( -\frac{35}{9} \).
</execution_3.3>
</Execution_3>

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.2:
But let me check another value. Suppose \( a = -2.5 \) (which is between -6 and -2) and \( b = 3 \). Then \( \frac{1}{9} - (-2.5)^2 = \frac{1}{9} - 6.25 \approx 0.111 - 6.25 = -6.139 \), which is more negative. So indeed, the closer \( a \) is to -2, the better.

Alternatively, if \( a = -2 \) and \( b = 3 \), the expression is \( \frac{1}{9} - (-2)^2 = \frac{1}{9} - 4 = -\frac{35}{9} \approx -3.888 \).

<prompt_4.1> Perform a final confirmation to ensure no miscalculations or overlooked possibilities. </prompt_4.1>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
If we take \( a = -2 \) and \( b = 4 \), we get \( \frac{1}{16} - 4 = -\frac{63}{16} \approx -3.9375 \), which is worse. Similarly, \( b = 5 \) gives \( \frac{1}{25} - 4 = -\frac{99}{25} = -3.96 \). So indeed, the smallest \( b \) gives the largest value (least negative). 

Therefore, the maximum value occurs at \( a = -2 \), \( b = 3 \), giving \( \frac{1}{9} - 4 = -\frac{35}{9} \).

Wait, but the problem says "greatest possible value". Since all possible values are negative, the greatest value is the one closest to zero, which is indeed when \( \frac{1}{b^2} \) is maximized and \( a^2 \) is minimized, which is \( a = -2 \), \( b = 3 \). 

But let me just check if there's any other combination where the expression could be higher. For example, if \( a \) is closer to -6, but then \( a^2 \) would be 36, which is way larger. So even if \( b \) is smaller, but \( a \) can't be. Wait, if \( a \) is -6, \( b \) is 3, then \( \frac{1}{9} - 36 = -\frac{323}{9} \approx -35.888 \), which is way worse. So no, the maximum occurs at \( a = -2 \), \( b = 3 \). 

Therefore, the answer should be \( -\frac{35}{9} \). But the problem says "greatest possible value", and since it's negative, this is the maximum. However, the problem also says "Express your answer as a common fraction". So \( -\frac{35}{9} \) is already a common fraction. But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me confirm once again.

Wait, maybe I should check if there's a different approach where the expression could be positive. Let me think. If \( \frac{1}{b} \) is positive (since \( b \) is positive between 3 and 5), and \( a \) is negative. So \( a + \frac{1}{b} \) could be positive or negative depending on the values. Similarly, \( \frac{1}{b} - a \) would be positive because \( \frac{1}{b} \) is positive and \( -a \) is positive (since \( a \) is negative). So \( \frac{1}{b} - a \) is definitely positive. 

Therefore, the second term \( \frac{1}{b} - a \) is positive. The first term \( a + \frac{1}{b} \) could be positive or negative. Let's see when it's positive. \( a + \frac{1}{b} > 0 \) implies \( \frac{1}{b} > -a \). Since \( a \) is negative, \( -a \) is positive. So if \( \frac{1}{b} > -a \), then the first term is positive. Otherwise, it's negative. 

But regardless, when we multiply the two terms, if both are positive, the product is positive; if one is positive and the other negative, the product is negative. However, as we saw earlier, the expression simplifies to \( \frac{1}{b^2} - a^2 \), which is always negative. Therefore, the product is negative, and the maximum value is the least negative one, which is when \( \frac{1}{b^2} \) is maximized and \( a^2 \) is minimized.

Therefore, the answer is indeed \( -\frac{35}{9} \). But let me confirm the arithmetic once again. 

If \( a = -2 \), then \( a^2 = (-2)^2 = 4 \). If \( b = 3 \), then \( \frac{1}{b^2} = \frac{1}{9} \). Therefore, \( \frac{1}{9} - 4 = \frac{1}{9} - \frac{36}{9} = -\frac{35}{9} \). Yes, that's correct. 

So the greatest possible value is \( -\frac{35}{9} \). Since the problem asks for the greatest possible value and to express it as a common fraction, the answer is \( -\frac{35}{9} \). However, fractions are usually expressed in positive terms if possible, but since this is a negative value, it has to stay negative. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the problem's phrasing? Let me check again. The problem says "greatest possible value". If all possible values are negative, then the greatest value is the one closest to zero. So yes, \( -\frac{35}{9} \) is the correct answer. 

I think that's it. I can't find any mistakes in this reasoning.
