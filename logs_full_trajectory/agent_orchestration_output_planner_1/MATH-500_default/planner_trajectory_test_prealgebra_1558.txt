<Question>
Bill walks $\frac{1}{2}$ mile south, then $\frac{3}{4}$ mile east, and finally $\frac{1}{2}$ mile south. How many miles is he, in a direct line, from his starting point?  Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.

Okay, let's try to figure out how far Bill is from his starting point after he walks those directions. Hmm, he goes south, then east, then south again. So, first, I need to visualize his path. Maybe drawing a diagram would help. Let me imagine a coordinate system where he starts at the origin (0,0).

<prompt_1.1> Visualize Bill's path using a coordinate system and calculate the total southward distance. </prompt_1.1>

Then he walks 3/4 mile east. East would be the positive x-direction. So from (0, -1/2), moving 3/4 east would take him to (0 + 3/4, -1/2 + 0) which is (3/4, -1/2). Wait, no, actually, if he's moving east, that's the x-coordinate increasing. So starting at (0, -1/2), moving east 3/4 mile would be (3/4, -1/2).

Then he walks another 1/2 mile south. South is the negative y-direction. So from (3/4, -1/2), moving south 1/2 mile would subtract 1/2 from the y-coordinate.
So the new y-coordinate is -1/2 - 1/2 = -1. So his final position is (3/4, -1).

South is the negative y-direction. So first, he walks 1/2 mile south. That would take him from (0,0) to (0, -1/2). Then he walks 3/4 mile east. East is the positive x-direction, so that would add 3/4 to the x-coordinate. Then he walks another 1/2 mile south, which is another 1/2 in the negative y-direction.

Based on execution_1.1:
So, breaking it down step by step:

<prompt_2.1> Break down Bill's movements step by step to determine his final position. </prompt_2.1>

Wait, is that right? Let me check again.

<prompt_2.2> Verify the calculated components and distance. </prompt_2.2>

Wait, but let me confirm. Let's think in terms of net movement.

<prompt_2.3> Calculate the net movement and confirm the distance using the Pythagorean theorem. </prompt_2.3>

But wait, let me just visualize this again. If he goes south, then east, then south.

<prompt_2.4> Visualize Bill's path to confirm the final position and distance. </prompt_2.4>

Alternatively, maybe using vectors. The total displacement is the vector sum of each leg.

<prompt_2.5> Use vector analysis to confirm the displacement and distance. </prompt_2.5>

But wait, let me check if there's any trick here. Sometimes with directions, you have to be careful with bearings or something else, but in this case, it's straightforward south, east, south.

<prompt_2.6> Consider any potential errors or complexities in the problem. </prompt_2.6>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
1. Start at (0,0).
2. Walk 1/2 mile south: y-coordinate decreases by 1/2. New position: (0, -1/2).
3. Walk 3/4 mile east: x-coordinate increases by 3/4. New position: (3/4, -1/2).
4. Walk 1/2 mile south: y-coordinate decreases by another 1/2. New y-coordinate: -1/2 - 1/2 = -1. So final position: (3/4, -1).
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
First leg: 1/2 mile south: (0,0) to (0, -1/2).

Second leg: 3/4 mile east: (0 - 1/2) to (3/4, -1/2).

Third leg: 1/2 mile south: (3/4, -1/2 - 1/2) = (3/4, -1). So yes, final coordinates (3/4, -1).

So, the displacement is from (0,0) to (3/4, -1). To find the straight-line distance, we use the Pythagorean theorem. The distance D is sqrt((3/4)^2 + (1)^2).
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
First leg: 1/2 mile south. Second leg: 3/4 mile east. Third leg: 1/2 mile south. So total southward distance is 1/2 + 1/2 = 1 mile south. Eastward distance is 3/4 mile. So his displacement is 1 mile south and 3/4 mile east from the starting point. So that forms a right triangle where the legs are 1 mile and 3/4 mile. Therefore, the straight-line distance is the hypotenuse of this triangle.
</execution_2.3>

<execution_2.4>
First, starting at (0,0), goes 1/2 south to (0, -1/2). Then 3/4 east to (3/4, -1/2). Then another 1/2 south to (3/4, -1/2 - 1/2) = (3/4, -1). So yes, final coordinates are (3/4, -1). So the displacement is 3/4 east and 1 mile south. Therefore, the straight-line distance is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs 3/4 and 1.
</execution_2.4>

<execution_2.5>
First leg: 1/2 mile south. That's (0, -1/2). Second leg: 3/4 mile east. That's (3/4, 0). Third leg: 1/2 mile south. That's (0, -1/2). So adding these vectors:

First leg vector: (0, -1/2)

Second leg vector: (3/4, 0)

Third leg vector: (0, -1/2)

Total displacement vector: (0 + 3/4 + 0, -1/2 + 0 -1/2) = (3/4, -1)

So the displacement is 3/4 miles east and 1 mile south.
</execution_2.5>

<execution_2.6>
So each leg is in a cardinal direction, no need to consider diagonal or anything else.

So, the total southward movement is 1/2 + 1/2 = 1 mile south. Then 3/4 mile east. So, net displacement is 1 mile south and 3/4 mile east. So, in coordinate terms, that's (3/4, -1). Therefore, the displacement vector is (3/4, -1). The straight-line distance from the origin would be the magnitude of this vector, which is sqrt( (3/4)^2 + (-1)^2 ).

</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Now, we need to find the straight-line distance from the starting point (0,0) to the final position (3/4, -1). The distance formula is sqrt[(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2]. Since he started at (0,0), it's just sqrt[(3/4)^2 + (-1)^2].
Calculating that: (3/4)^2 is 9/16, and (-1)^2 is 1. So 9/16 + 1 = 25/16. The square root of 25/16 is 5/4, which is 1.25. So 1.25 miles.

Based on execution_2.6:
Calculating that:

<prompt_3.1> Recalculate the displacement and confirm the final distance. </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
(3/4)^2 = 9/16

(-1)^2 = 1

Adding them: 9/16 + 16/16 = 25/16

Square root of 25/16 is 5/4 = 1.25

So, the distance is 1.25 miles.

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
Wait, but 5/4 is 1.25, which is already to the nearest hundredth.
So the answer would be 1.25 miles. But let me check if I did everything correctly.

<prompt_4.1> Confirm the entire process and conclude the solution. </prompt_4.1>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
Wait, 3/4 is 0.75, and 1 is 1.0. So sqrt(0.75^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(0.5625 + 1) = sqrt(1.5625). What's sqrt(1.5625)? Let me compute that. Since 1.25^2 is 1.5625, yes. Because 1.2^2 is 1.44, 1.3^2 is 1.69, so 1.25^2 is (5/4)^2 = 25/16 = 1.5625. So yes, sqrt(1.5625) is 1.25. So the distance is 1.25 miles. So, as a decimal to the nearest hundredth, that's 1.25. So the answer is 1.25 miles.

But let me just make sure that I didn't make any mistake in the direction. So he walks south, then east, then south again. So the total southward movement is indeed 1/2 + 1/2 = 1 mile. East is 3/4 mile. So the displacement is 1 mile south and 3/4 mile east. So the legs of the right triangle are 1 and 0.75. Then the hypotenuse is sqrt(1^2 + 0.75^2) = sqrt(1 + 0.5625) = sqrt(1.5625) = 1.25. So that seems correct. Therefore, the answer should be 1.25 miles.
</execution_4.1>

<Final_answer>
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{1.25}$ miles.
