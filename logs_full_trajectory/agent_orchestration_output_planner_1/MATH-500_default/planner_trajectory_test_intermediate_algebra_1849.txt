</Question>

<think>
<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to find the number of integer values of k between -500 and 500 inclusive such that the equation log(kx) = 2 log(x + 2) has exactly one real solution. Hmm, let's start by understanding the equation step by step.

<prompt_1.1> Understand the given equation and determine the domain where the logarithms are defined. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
First, logarithms have certain domain restrictions. The arguments inside the logs must be positive. So for log(kx) to be defined, kx must be positive. Similarly, for 2 log(x + 2) to be defined, x + 2 must be positive, so x > -2. Also, since the right side is 2 log(x + 2), that's the same as log((x + 2)^2). So maybe I can rewrite the equation using logarithm properties.

Let me try that.
</execution_1.1>
</Execution_1>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
The original equation is log(kx) = 2 log(x + 2). Using the power rule for logarithms, 2 log(x + 2) becomes log((x + 2)^2). So the equation simplifies to log(kx) = log((x + 2)^2).

If the logs are equal, then their arguments must be equal, right? So that gives kx = (x + 2)^2. But I have to remember that the domain is such that x > -2 and kx > 0. So depending on the sign of k, x must be positive if k is positive, or negative if k is negative. But since x > -2, if k is negative, x has to be between -2 and 0.

<prompt_2.1> Solve the equation kx = (x + 2)^2 and determine the conditions for exactly one real solution. </prompt_2.1>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Wait, let me clarify.

First, let's write down the equation again: log(kx) = log((x + 2)^2). Therefore, kx = (x + 2)^2, with the conditions that kx > 0 and x + 2 > 0. So x > -2, and kx > 0. So if k is positive, then x must be positive. If k is negative, then x must be negative, but still greater than -2. So x ∈ (-2, 0) if k is negative.

So the equation reduces to a quadratic equation: (x + 2)^2 = kx. Let's expand that: x^2 + 4x + 4 = kx. Bringing all terms to one side: x^2 + (4 - k)x + 4 = 0. So quadratic equation x^2 + (4 - k)x + 4 = 0. We need to find the integer values of k in [-500, 500] such that this quadratic equation has exactly one real solution, but also considering the domain restrictions from the logarithm.

But wait, quadratic equations can have 0, 1, or 2 real solutions. For there to be exactly one real solution, the discriminant must be zero. So discriminant D = [ (4 - k) ]^2 - 4 * 1 * 4 = (4 - k)^2 - 16. Setting D = 0: (4 - k)^2 - 16 = 0. Let's solve this:

(4 - k)^2 = 16

Take square roots:

4 - k = ±4

So two cases:

1. 4 - k = 4 ⇒ -k = 0 ⇒ k = 0
2. 4 - k = -4 ⇒ -k = -8 ⇒ k = 8

So when k = 0 or k = 8, the quadratic equation has exactly one real solution.

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
But we need to check if these solutions are valid in the original logarithmic equation's domain.

First, k = 0.

-----

But wait, quadratic equations can have 0, 1, or 2 real solutions. For there to be exactly one real solution, the discriminant must be zero. So discriminant D = [ (4 - k) ]^2 - 4 * 1 * 4 = (4 - k)^2 - 16. Setting D = 0: (4 - k)^2 - 16 = 0. Let's solve this:

(4 - k)^2 = 16

Take square roots:

4 - k = ±4

So two cases:

1. 4 - k = 4 ⇒ -k = 0 ⇒ k = 0
2. 4 - k = -4 ⇒ -k = -8 ⇒ k = 8

So when k = 0 or k = 8, the quadratic equation has exactly one real solution.
But we need to check if these solutions for k = 0 and k = 8 are valid in the original logarithmic equation's domain.

For k = 0: The original equation becomes log(0 * x) = log(0) which is undefined. So k = 0 is invalid. So only k = 8 is a candidate from the discriminant condition.

But wait, maybe there's another scenario where the quadratic equation has two roots, but one is extraneous due to the domain restrictions, leaving only one valid solution. So even if the discriminant is positive (two roots), but one is invalid, then we have exactly one solution. So we need to check both possibilities: discriminant zero (one solution) and discriminant positive but one root invalid (also one solution).

Therefore, we need to consider two cases:

Case 1: Quadratic equation has exactly one real solution (discriminant zero), and that solution is valid in the domain.

Case 2: Quadratic equation has two real solutions, but one is invalid due to domain restrictions, leaving exactly one valid solution.

So first, let's handle Case 1: discriminant zero.

<prompt_3.2> Re-evaluate Case 1 and Case 2 for exactly one real solution, considering domain restrictions. </prompt_3.2>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
If k = 0, then the original equation becomes log(0 * x) = log(x + 2)^2. But log(0) is undefined, so k = 0 is not allowed. So k = 0 is invalid. Therefore, only k = 8 remains.

But wait, maybe there's another scenario where the quadratic equation has two roots, but one is invalid due to domain restrictions, leaving only one valid solution. So even if the discriminant is positive (two roots), but one is invalid, then we have exactly one solution. So we need to check both possibilities: discriminant zero (one solution) and discriminant positive but one root invalid (also one solution).
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
As before, discriminant D = (4 - k)^2 - 16. Setting D = 0 gives k = 0 or k = 8. But k = 0 leads to log(0), which is undefined, so only k = 8. For k = 8, the quadratic equation becomes x^2 + (4 - 8)x + 4 = x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0. This factors as (x - 2)^2 = 0, so x = 2. Now check if x = 2 is valid in the original equation.

Original equation: log(8 * 2) = log(16) and 2 log(2 + 2) = 2 log(4) = log(16). So both sides are equal, and log(16) is defined. Also, x = 2 > -2, and kx = 16 > 0. So valid. So k = 8 is good.
</execution_3.2>
</Execution_3>

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.2:
Now, Case 2: discriminant positive, so two real roots, but one is invalid. Let's analyze when this happens.

Discriminant D = (4 - k)^2 - 16 > 0 ⇒ (4 - k)^2 > 16 ⇒ |4 - k| > 4 ⇒ 4 - k > 4 or 4 - k < -4 ⇒ -k > 0 ⇒ k < 0, or 4 - k < -4 ⇒ -k < -8 ⇒ k > 8.

<prompt_4.1> Analyze Case 2 where the quadratic equation has two real roots, but one is invalid due to domain restrictions. </prompt_4.1>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
So discriminant is positive when k < 0 or k > 8. So for k < 0 or k > 8, quadratic equation has two distinct real roots. But we need to check if one of them is invalid (either x ≤ -2 or kx ≤ 0). Remember, original equation requires x > -2 and kx > 0.

So for k < 0: x must be in (-2, 0). So any root x ≥ 0 would be invalid, as x must be negative (since k is negative). But let's see. Let's take a general k < 0. The quadratic equation is x^2 + (4 - k)x + 4 = 0. Let's denote this as x^2 + bx + c = 0 where b = 4 - k and c = 4. The roots are [ -b ± sqrt(D) ] / 2. Since D > 0 here, two real roots. Let's compute the roots:

x = [ -(4 - k) ± sqrt((4 - k)^2 - 16) ] / 2

But since k < 0, let's substitute k = -m where m > 0. Then:

x = [ -(4 - (-m)) ± sqrt((4 - (-m))^2 - 16) ] / 2 = [ -(4 + m) ± sqrt((4 + m)^2 - 16) ] / 2

Compute sqrt((4 + m)^2 - 16) = sqrt(16 + 8m + m^2 - 16) = sqrt(m^2 + 8m) = m sqrt(1 + 8/m). Since m > 0, this is real.

So the roots are:

x = [ -4 - m ± m sqrt(1 + 8/m) ] / 2

Let me factor out m from the square root:

sqrt(1 + 8/m) = sqrt( (m + 8)/m ). Hmm, maybe not necessary. Let's compute the two roots:

First root with the plus sign:

x1 = [ -4 - m + sqrt(m^2 + 8m) ] / 2

Second root with the minus sign:

x2 = [ -4 - m - sqrt(m^2 + 8m) ] / 2

We need to check if these roots are in (-2, 0) since k is negative. Let's analyze x1 and x2.

First, note that sqrt(m^2 + 8m) = sqrt(m(m + 8)). Since m > 0, this is greater than m, because m(m + 8) > m^2 ⇒ sqrt(m(m + 8)) > m. Therefore, sqrt(m^2 + 8m) > m.

So for x1:

x1 = [ -4 - m + sqrt(m^2 + 8m) ] / 2

Since sqrt(m^2 + 8m) > m, then -4 - m + sqrt(m^2 + 8m) > -4 - m + m = -4. So x1 > (-4)/2 = -2. So x1 is greater than -2. Now, is x1 positive?

Let's check:

sqrt(m^2 + 8m) > m + 4?

Wait, sqrt(m^2 + 8m) compared to m + 4. Let's square both sides:

Left side squared: m^2 + 8m

Right side squared: (m + 4)^2 = m^2 + 8m + 16

So m^2 + 8m < m^2 + 8m + 16 ⇒ sqrt(m^2 + 8m) < m + 4. Therefore, sqrt(m^2 + 8m) - (m + 4) is negative. Therefore, -4 - m + sqrt(m^2 + 8m) = sqrt(m^2 + 8m) - (m + 4) < 0. Therefore, x1 = [ negative ] / 2 ⇒ x1 < 0. So x1 is in (-2, 0) because we already saw it's greater than -2, and less than 0. So x1 is valid.

Now check x2:

x2 = [ -4 - m - sqrt(m^2 + 8m) ] / 2

Both terms in the numerator are negative, so x2 is negative. Let's check if it's less than -2:

Compute numerator: -4 - m - sqrt(m^2 + 8m). Let's see if this is less than -4 (since if numerator < -4, then x2 < -2).

Is -4 - m - sqrt(m^2 + 8m) < -4?

Subtract -4 from both sides: -m - sqrt(m^2 + 8m) < 0. Since m > 0, both terms are negative, so yes, this is true. Therefore, numerator < -4 ⇒ x2 < (-4)/2 = -2. Therefore, x2 < -2, which is invalid because x must be > -2. So x2 is extraneous.

Therefore, for k < 0, quadratic equation has two roots, but only x1 is valid (in (-2, 0)), so there's exactly one solution. Therefore, all k < 0 would lead to exactly one real solution. But wait, we need to check if x1 is positive or negative. Wait, earlier we saw that x1 is between -2 and 0. So x1 is in (-2, 0), which is valid for k < 0. So for all k < 0, we have exactly one solution.

But we need to confirm if x1 is indeed in (-2, 0). Let's take an example. Let k = -1 (so m = 1).

Based on execution_4.1:
Then quadratic equation is x^2 + (4 - (-1))x + 4 = x^2 + 5x + 4 = 0. Factors as (x + 1)(x + 4) = 0. Roots at x = -1 and x = -4. But x must be in (-2, 0) because k is negative. So x = -1 is valid, x = -4 is invalid. So exactly one solution. So k = -1 is valid.

<prompt_5.1> Verify the analysis for Case 2 with specific examples and determine the number of valid k values. </prompt_5.1>

<execution_5.1>
Another example: k = -2. Quadratic equation: x^2 + (4 - (-2))x + 4 = x^2 + 6x + 4 = 0. Discriminant 36 - 16 = 20. Roots: [-6 ± sqrt(20)] / 2 = [-6 ± 2*sqrt(5)] / 2 = -3 ± sqrt(5). sqrt(5) ≈ 2.236. So roots are approximately -3 + 2.236 ≈ -0.764 and -3 - 2.236 ≈ -5.236. So x ≈ -0.764 is in (-2, 0), valid. The other root is invalid. So exactly one solution. So k = -2 is valid.

Similarly, k = -100 (within the interval). Then quadratic equation: x^2 + (4 - (-100))x + 4 = x^2 + 104x + 4 = 0. Discriminant: 104^2 - 16 = 10816 - 16 = 10800. sqrt(10800) = sqrt(100*108) = 10*sqrt(108) ≈ 10*10.392 = 103.92. So roots: [-104 ± 103.92]/2. So first root: (-104 + 103.92)/2 ≈ (-0.08)/2 ≈ -0.04, which is in (-2, 0). Second root: (-104 - 103.92)/2 ≈ -207.92/2 ≈ -103.96, which is less than -2. So invalid. So exactly one solution. So k = -100 is valid.

Therefore, for all k < 0, we have exactly one solution. But wait, we need to check if kx > 0. Since k is negative, x must be negative. But x is in (-2, 0), so kx is positive (negative times negative). So yes, kx > 0. So all k < 0 are valid, leading to exactly one solution.

Now, what about k > 8? For k > 8, discriminant is positive, so two real roots. Let's analyze the roots. For k > 8, let's denote k = 9 as an example.
</execution_5.1>
</Execution_5>

<Plan_6>
Based on execution_5.1:
Quadratic equation: x^2 + (4 - 9)x + 4 = x^2 -5x +4 =0. Factors as (x -1)(x -4)=0. So roots at x=1 and x=4. Both are positive, so valid for k=9 (since k>0, x must be positive). So check original equation.

<prompt_6.1> Analyze Case 2 for k > 8 with specific examples and determine the number of valid k values. </prompt_6.1>
</Plan_6>

<Execution_6>
<execution_6.1>
For x=1: log(9*1)=log(9), and 2 log(1+2)=2 log(3)=log(9). So valid. For x=4: log(9*4)=log(36), and 2 log(4+2)=2 log(6)=log(36). Valid. So two solutions. Therefore, k=9 would lead to two solutions. But we need exactly one solution. Therefore, k >8 would lead to two solutions, which is not desired.

But wait, maybe another example where k >8 but one root is invalid? Wait, let's check another k. Let's take k=10.

Quadratic equation: x^2 + (4 -10)x +4= x^2 -6x +4=0. Discriminant 36 -16=20. Roots: [6 ± sqrt(20)]/2= [6 ± 2*sqrt(5)]/2= 3 ± sqrt(5). sqrt(5)≈2.236. So roots≈5.236 and≈0.764. Both positive. So both valid. So two solutions. Therefore, for k >8, quadratic has two positive roots, both valid, leading to two solutions. Therefore, k >8 would lead to two solutions. Therefore, only k=8 and all k <0 lead to exactly one solution.

But wait, let's check another example. Suppose k=16. Quadratic equation: x^2 + (4 -16)x +4= x^2 -12x +4=0. Discriminant 144 -16=128. sqrt(128)=8*sqrt(2)≈11.31. Roots: [12 ±11.31]/2. So (12 +11.31)/2≈23.31/2≈11.655, and (12 -11.31)/2≈0.69/2≈0.345. Both positive. So two solutions. Therefore, indeed, for k >8, two solutions. Hence, only k=8 and k <0 give exactly one solution.

<Plan_7>
Based on execution_6.1:
But wait, let's check the edge case when k=8. We already did that, it gives x=2, which is valid. So k=8 is included in Case 1.

<prompt_7.1> Verify the edge case for k=8 and summarize the valid k values. </prompt_7.1>
</Plan_7>

<Execution_7>
<execution_7.1>
So now, combining both cases:

Case 1: k=8 (one solution)

Case 2: All k <0 (each gives exactly one solution)

But wait, we need to check if k=0 is excluded. Since k=0 leads to log(0), which is undefined, so excluded. So total k values are all integers from -500 to -1 (since k=0 is excluded) and k=8. So how many integers are there?

From -500 to -1 inclusive: that's 500 numbers (since 0 is excluded). Then plus k=8. So total 501 integers.

But wait, check if k=8 is within [-500,500]. Yes, 8 is between -500 and 500. So total number of integer k values is 500 (negative integers) +1 (k=8) =501.

But wait, let's compute it properly. The integers from -500 to -1 inclusive: the number of integers is 500 (since from 1 to 500 negative). Then add 1 for k=8. So total 501.

But wait, let me confirm. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a +1. But here, from -500 to -1: a = -500, b = -1. So number of integers is (-1) - (-500) +1 = 499 +1 =500. Yes. So 500 negative integers, and 1 integer (k=8). Total 501.

But wait, but we need to check if k=8 is in [-500,500]. Yes, 8 ≤500. So yes. So total 501 integers.

But wait, let's check if there are any other edge cases. For example, when k=1, which is greater than 8, but we saw that it gives two solutions. So k=1 is invalid. Similarly, k=9, etc. , also invalid. So only k=8 and all k <0.

But wait, let's check another example for k=8. Suppose k=8, quadratic equation gives x=2. Which is valid. So that's one solution. So correct.

But wait, another thought: when k <0, the quadratic equation has two roots, but only one is valid. So for each k <0, exactly one solution. So total number of k is 500 (from -500 to -1) plus 1 (k=8). So 501.

But let me check if k=8 is the only k from k>8 that gives one solution. Wait, no. For k>8, as we saw, two solutions. So only k=8 is valid in k>8. So total k's are k=8 and all k <0. So 500 +1=501.

But let's check the interval again. The interval is [-500,500]. So k can be -500, -499, ...., -1, 0, 1, ....,500. We need to exclude k=0, and include k=8. So total integers:

Negative integers: from -500 to -1: 500 numbers.

k=8: 1 number.

Total: 501.

But let's make sure that k=8 is within the interval. Since 8 ≤500, yes.

But wait, another check: when k=8, x=2. Which is in the domain x > -2. So valid. So yes.

But let's check if there are other values of k where quadratic equation has one solution. For example, if the quadratic equation has a repeated root that is invalid. But we already considered discriminant zero (k=0,8) and k=0 is invalid. So only k=8 is valid in that case.

Therefore, the answer is 501. But let me confirm once again.

Based on execution_7.1:
Total number of integers from -500 to -1: 500 numbers (since inclusive). Then k=8. So total 501.

<execution_8.1>
Suppose k= -1: one solution. k=8: one solution. k=9: two solutions. So yes, the count is 500 +1=501.

But wait, another edge case: k=1. If k=1, which is greater than 8, quadratic equation x^2 -4x +4=0. Wait, no, for k=1, quadratic equation is x^2 + (4 -1)x +4= x^2 +3x +4=0. Discriminant 9 -16= -7 <0. So no real solutions. So k=1 would lead to no solution. But since k=1 is in the interval, but it's invalid. But since we already considered k>8 leads to two solutions, but for k=9, we had two solutions. Wait, but for k=9, quadratic equation is x^2 -5x +4=0, which factors to (x-1)(x-4)=0, two solutions. So k=9 is valid. But for k=1, quadratic equation has no real roots. So k=1 is invalid. So our previous conclusion holds: only k=8 and k<0 give exactly one solution.

Therefore, the number of integer values is 500 (negative k's) +1 (k=8)=501.

Quadratic equation: x^2 + (4 - (-3))x +4= x^2 +7x +4=0. Discriminant 49 -16=33. Roots: [-7 ± sqrt(33)]/2. sqrt(33)≈5.744. So roots≈(-7 +5.744)/2≈-0.628/2≈-0.314 and (-7 -5.744)/2≈-12.744/2≈-6.372. So x≈-0.314 is in (-2,0), valid. The other root invalid. So exactly one solution. So k=-3 is valid.

Therefore, all k <0 are valid, leading to exactly one solution. And k=8. Therefore, total number is 500 +1=501. So the answer is 501.

But wait, the problem says "closed interval [-500,500]". So k can be -500 and 500. So when counting the negative integers from -500 to -1, inclusive, that's 500 numbers. Then k=8. So total 501. Therefore, the final answer is \boxed{501}.
