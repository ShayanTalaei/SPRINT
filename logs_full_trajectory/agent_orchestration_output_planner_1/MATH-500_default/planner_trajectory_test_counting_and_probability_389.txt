Okay, so Mikka wants to order a pizza with two different toppings, and he has 8 different toppings to choose from. The question is asking how many different pizzas he could order. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to understand the problem. He wants a pizza with two toppings, and each pizza must have two distinct ones. The order probably doesn't matter here, right? Like, if he picks pepperoni and mushrooms, it's the same as mushrooms and pepperoni on a pizza. So it's a combination problem, not a permutation. Combinations are used when the order doesn't matter, and permutations when it does. So that's a starting point.

Alright, so if there are 8 toppings and he wants two, the formula for combinations is n choose k, which is n!

<prompt_1.1> Use the combination formula to calculate the number of ways to choose 2 toppings out of 8. </prompt_1.1>

<execution_1.1>
divided by (k! times (n - k)! ). So in this case, n is 8 and k is 2. Let me write that down: 8 choose 2 is 8! divided by (2! times (8 - 2)! ).
</execution_1.1>
</Execution_1>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Simplifying the factorial expressions, 8!
Is 8 × 7 × 6! , and (8 - 2)! is 6! . So when we divide 8! by 6! , we get 8 × 7. Then divide that by 2!

<prompt_2.1> Simplify the expression 8! / (2! * 6!) to find the number of combinations. </prompt_2.1>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
which is 2. So 8 × 7 is 56, divided by 2 is 28.
</execution_2.1>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
So that would be 28 different pizzas.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Let me think of a simpler case.

<prompt_3.1> Verify the calculation using a simpler case with 3 toppings. </prompt_3.1>

Another way to think about it: for the first topping, Mikka has 8 choices. For the second topping, since he can't choose the same one, he has 7 choices.

<prompt_3.2> Calculate the number of combinations by considering choices for each topping and adjust for combinations. </prompt_3.2>

Is there any chance I missed something here? Let's see. The problem states he wants two different toppings.

<prompt_3.3> Verify the assumptions of the problem regarding the use of combinations and no repetition. </prompt_3.3>

Alternatively, if we think of the toppings as labeled from 1 to 8, the number of unordered pairs is the same as the number of combinations. For example, topping 1 can pair with 2,3,4,5,6,7,8 (7 pairs), topping 2 can pair with 3,4,5,6,7,8 (6 pairs), and so on, decreasing by 1 each time.

<prompt_3.4> Verify the result by enumerating pairs starting from each topping. </prompt_3.4>

I can't think of any other factors that might affect the calculation. The problem doesn't mention any restrictions like some toppings not being allowed together or size variations, so we can safely assume all combinations are possible.
Therefore, the total number of different pizzas Mikka could order with two different toppings is 28.

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
Suppose there are 3 toppings: A, B, C. How many two-topping pizzas? According to the formula, 3 choose 2 is 3. And indeed, AB, AC, BC are three combinations. If I use the other method: 3 × 2 divided by 2, which is 6/2 = 3.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
So 8 times 7 is 56. But since the order doesn't matter, each pizza is being counted twice here (once for each possible order of the two toppings). So to get the actual number of unique combinations, we divide by 2. That gives 56 divided by 2, which is 28.
</execution_3.2>

<execution_3.3>
So repetition isn't allowed. If he could have two of the same topping, it would be different, but the problem says two different toppings. So combinations, not permutations. So yes, 8 choose 2. And since combinations account for the fact that order doesn't matter, that's exactly what we need here. So the calculation should be correct.
</execution_3.3>

<execution_3.4>
So the total number would be 7 + 6 + 5 + ... + 1. The sum of the first n natural numbers is n(n + 1)/2. But here, since we start from 7 and go down to 1 when n is 8, the sum is 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1. Let's calculate that: 7+6=13, 13+5=18, 18+4=22, 22+3=25, 25+2=27, 27+1=28. So that also gives 28.
</execution_3.4>
</Execution_3>

<Final_answer>
So, the total number of different pizzas Mikka could order is $\boxed{28}$.
