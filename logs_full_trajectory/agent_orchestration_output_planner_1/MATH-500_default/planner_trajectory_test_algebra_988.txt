Okay, so I need to solve the equation 2/3 equals 4 over (x minus 5). Let me write that down again to make sure I have it right: (2/3) = (4)/(x - 5).

Hmm, solving for x here. Alright, let's think about how to approach this. It's a proportion, right? So maybe I can cross-multiply to get rid of the fractions. That usually works with proportions.

<prompt_1.1> Cross-multiply the equation 2/3 = 4/(x - 5) to eliminate the fractions. </prompt_1.1>

Let me try that. If I cross-multiply, that would mean multiplying the numerator of one side by the denominator of the other. So, 2 times (x - 5) should equal 3 times 4. Let me check: 2*(x - 5) = 3*4.

Based on execution_1.1:
Wait, is that right? Let me confirm.
The original equation is 2/3 = 4/(x - 5). Cross-multiplying would give 2*(x - 5) = 3*4. Yeah, that seems correct.

So simplifying both sides: On the left side, distribute the 2 into (x - 5).
That would be 2*x - 2*5, which is 2x - 10. On the right side, 3*4 is 12. So now the equation is 2x - 10 = 12.

Now, solve for x. Let me add 10 to both sides to isolate the term with x.
Adding 10 to both sides: 2x - 10 + 10 = 12 + 10, which simplifies to 2x = 22. Then divide both sides by 2: 2x/2 = 22/2, so x = 11.

But wait, I need to check if this solution is valid. Sometimes when you have variables in denominators, you might get extraneous solutions if the denominator becomes zero. Let me check the original equation.
The denominator here is (x - 5). If x = 11, then 11 - 5 = 6, which is not zero. So that's good. The original equation's denominator is fine, so x = 11 is a valid solution.

Let me verify by plugging it back into the original equation. Left side is 2/3. Right side is 4 divided by (11 - 5) which is 4/6.
Simplifying 4/6 gives 2/3, which matches the left side. So yes, that checks out.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the steps. Let's go through them again.

<prompt_2.1> Review and verify each step of the solution process to ensure no mistakes were made. </prompt_2.1>

Is there another way to solve this equation? Maybe by finding a common denominator? Let's try that method to cross-verify.

<prompt_2.2> Solve the equation using the method of finding a common denominator to cross-verify the solution. </prompt_2.2>

Alternatively, could I simplify the equation before cross-multiplying? Let's see.

<prompt_2.3> Simplify the equation before cross-multiplying and solve to cross-verify the solution. </prompt_2.3>

<execution_2.1>
Original equation: 2/3 = 4/(x - 5). Cross-multiplication gives 2*(x - 5) = 12. Distribute: 2x - 10 = 12. Add 10: 2x = 22. Divide by 2: x = 11.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
The denominators are 3 and (x - 5). The common denominator would be 3(x - 5). So if I rewrite both sides with that denominator:

Left side: (2/3) * (x - 5)/(x - 5) = 2(x - 5)/[3(x - 5)]

Right side: (4)/(x - 5) * 3/3 = 12/[3(x - 5)]

Now, since the denominators are the same, the numerators must be equal: 2(x - 5) = 12. Wait, that's the same equation I got before. So distributing gives 2x - 10 = 12, leading to x = 11. Same result.
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
The equation is 2/3 = 4/(x - 5). Notice that 4 is 2*2, so maybe I can write 4 as 2*2. Let me see:

2/3 = (2*2)/(x - 5). Then divide both sides by 2: (2/3)/2 = 2/(x - 5). Simplifying the left side: (2/3)*(1/2) = 1/3. So now we have 1/3 = 2/(x - 5). Then cross-multiply again: 1*(x - 5) = 3*2. So x - 5 = 6. Then x = 11. Same result. So that works too.

x = \boxed{11}
