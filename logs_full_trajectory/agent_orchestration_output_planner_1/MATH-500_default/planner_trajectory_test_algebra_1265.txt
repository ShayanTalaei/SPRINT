Okay, so I need to figure out what power of 4 gives me 8. Hmm, let's start by understanding the question. They want to know what exponent I need to apply to 4 to get 8. In mathematical terms, they're asking for x in the equation 4^x = 8.

Let me think. I know that 4 squared is 16, which is too big, and 4 to the first power is 4, which is too small. So the exponent must be somewhere between 1 and 2. But since they want a common fraction, it's probably a fraction like 3/2 or something.

Wait, maybe I can express both 4 and 8 as powers of 2. Because 4 is 2 squared, right?
So 4 is 2^2. And 8 is 2 cubed, because 2*2*2 is 8. So if I rewrite the equation 4^x = 8 using base 2, that would be (2^2)^x = 2^3.

Applying the exponent rule (a^m)^n = a^(m*n), the left side becomes 2^(2x).

So now the equation is 2^(2x) = 2^3.

Since the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal.
Therefore, 2x = 3. Solving for x, divide both sides by 2, so x = 3/2.

Wait, but let me check that again. If I take 4 raised to the power of 3/2, does that equal 8?

Let's break down 4^(3/2).

<prompt_1.1> Verify that 4^(3/2) equals 8. </prompt_1.1>

But wait, maybe there's another way to approach this using logarithms? Let me try that to confirm. Taking the logarithm of both sides.

<prompt_1.2> Solve the equation 4^x = 8 using logarithms. </prompt_1.2>

Alternatively, using natural logarithm: ln(4^x) = ln(8). Which gives x*ln(4) = ln(8).

<prompt_1.3> Solve the equation 4^x = 8 using natural logarithms. </prompt_1.3>

<execution_1.1>
The exponent 3/2 can be thought of as taking the square root of 4 first, which is 2, and then cubing it. So sqrt(4) = 2, then 2^3 = 8.
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
If 4^x = 8, then taking the natural log of both sides: ln(4^x) = ln(8). That becomes x*ln(4) = ln(8). Then x = ln(8)/ln(4). Let me compute that. 

I know that ln(8) is ln(2^3) = 3*ln(2), and ln(4) is ln(2^2) = 2*ln(2). So substituting back in, x = (3*ln(2))/(2*ln(2)) = 3/2. Same result. That confirms it.

<execution_1.3>
Then x = ln(8)/ln(4). Let me compute that. Since ln(8) is ln(2^3) = 3*ln(2), and ln(4) is ln(2^2) = 2*ln(2). So substituting back, x = (3*ln(2))/(2*ln(2)) = 3/2.

Based on execution_1.1, execution_1.2, execution_1.3:
Alternatively, if I use logarithms with a different base, say base 4. Then log base 4 of 8 is x.
Using the change of base formula: log_4(8) = log_10(8)/log_10(4) or ln(8)/ln(4). Either way, we already saw that gives 3/2.

Another way to think about it: 4^x = 8. Let's write 4 as 2^2 and 8 as 2^3, so (2^2)^x = 2^3.
Which simplifies to 2^(2x) = 2^3. Therefore, 2x = 3, so x = 3/2. Yep, same answer.

Is there a way to do this without using logarithms or converting to a different base? Maybe by trial and error?

<prompt_2.1> Explore trial and error to estimate the exponent x in 4^x = 8. </prompt_2.1>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Let's see. If x is 1.5, as we found, but how would I know that without logarithms? Let's try. 4^1 = 4, 4^1.5 = sqrt(4^3). Wait, 4^3 is 64, sqrt(64) is 8. So 4^1.5 = 8. So 1.5 is 3/2. So that works.

Alternatively, if I didn't see the base conversion, maybe I could set x = y/2 to make it an even exponent? Hmm, not sure. Let's see. Suppose I let x = y/2, then 4^(y/2) = 8. Then sqrt(4)^y = 8. Since sqrt(4) is 2, so 2^y = 8. Then y = 3, so x = 3/2. That works too. So by substituting, we can solve for y first, then get x.

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
So all methods lead to x = 3/2. Therefore, the power is 3/2.

Wait, just to check once more. 4^(3/2) = (4^(1/2))^3 = (2)^3 = 8.
Or 4^(3/2) = (4^3)^(1/2) = 64^(1/2) = 8. Either way, it works.

I think that's thorough. I considered multiple methods: expressing in common bases, using logarithms, substituting variables, and verifying through different exponent rules. All confirm that the exponent is 3/2. So the answer should be 3/2 as a common fraction.
