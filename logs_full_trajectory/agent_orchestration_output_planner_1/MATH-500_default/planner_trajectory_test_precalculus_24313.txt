Okay, so I need to simplify the expression sec x over sin x minus sin x over cos x. Let me write that down first to see it clearly: (sec x / sin x) - (sin x / cos x). Hmm, right. Let me recall some trigonometric identities. Sec x is the reciprocal of cos x, right? So sec x is 1/cos x. Maybe I can substitute that in to make it easier.

<prompt_1.1> Substitute the identity for sec x into the expression as per the above plan. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<execution_1.1>
Let me try that. So replacing sec x with 1/cos x, the first term becomes (1/cos x) divided by sin x. Dividing by sin x is the same as multiplying by 1/sin x, so that would be 1/(cos x * sin x). Okay, so the first part simplifies to 1/(sin x cos x). The second term is sin x over cos x, which is just tan x, but maybe it's better to keep it as sin x / cos x for now.

Based on execution_1.1:
So the expression is now 1/(sin x cos x) minus sin x / cos x. Hmm, perhaps I can combine these two terms into a single fraction. To do that, they need a common denominator. The first term already has denominator sin x cos x, and the second term has denominator cos x. So if I multiply the numerator and denominator of the second term by sin x, that will give it the same denominator as the first term. Let's try that.

Multiplying sin x / cos x by sin x / sin x gives (sin x * sin x)/(cos x * sin x) = sin²x / (sin x cos x). So now both terms have the same denominator. The expression becomes [1 - sin²x]/(sin x cos x).

Based on execution_2.1:
Wait, the numerator is 1 - sin²x. But I remember the Pythagorean identity: 1 - sin²x = cos²x. Yes, that's right. So substituting that in, the numerator becomes cos²x. So now the expression is cos²x/(sin x cos x).

Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by converting everything to sine and cosine from the start? Let's see. The original expression is sec x / sin x - sin x / cos x.

Then, cos²x divided by sin x cos x. I can cancel one cos x from the numerator and denominator, leaving cos x / sin x. And cos x over sin x is cot x. Alternatively, cos x / sin x is cot x, so the expression simplifies to cot x.

<execution_3.2>
Sec x is 1/cos x, so the first term is (1/cos x)/sin x = 1/(sin x cos x). The second term is sin x / cos x. So that's the same as before. So combining them gives the same steps. So either way, it's the same result.

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with sec x / sin x - sin x / cos x. Replace sec x with 1/cos x: (1/cos x)/sin x - sin x / cos x.
That's 1/(sin x cos x) - sin x / cos x. Then, to combine, multiply the second term by sin x/sin x: [1 - sin²x]/(sin x cos x). Then, 1 - sin²x is cos²x, so cos²x/(sin x cos x) simplifies to cos x / sin x, which is cot x.
-----

Alternatively, if I didn't see that 1 - sin²x is cos²x, maybe I could factor something else? Let's see. The numerator is 1 - sin²x. That factors into (1 - sin x)(1 + sin x), but that doesn't seem helpful here. Because the denominator is sin x cos x. Unless there's another identity or factorization, but I don't think so. The standard identity 1 - sin²x = cos²x is the way to go.

Is there a possibility that I made a mistake in combining the fractions? Let me verify. The first term is 1/(sin x cos x), the second term is sin x / cos x. To subtract them, they need a common denominator.

<prompt_4.1> Verify the steps of combining and simplifying the fractions using the above plan. </prompt_4.1>

So, after simplifying, we have cos x / sin x, which is cot x. Therefore, the simplified form of the original expression is cot x.

So, the final answer is cot x. Let me just make sure that cot x is the simplest form.

<prompt_4.2> Confirm the final simplified form of the expression using the above plan. </prompt_4.2>

Alternatively, if we wanted to express this in terms of other trigonometric functions, but cot x is already a single term, so I think that's as simplified as it gets.

Let me check with a different approach. Suppose I express everything in terms of sine and cosine from the start. The original expression is sec x / sin x - sin x / cos x. Since sec x is 1/cos x, so substituting that in, we have (1/cos x)/sin x - sin x / cos x.

<prompt_4.3> Re-evaluate the expression using the above plan. </prompt_4.3>

Another way to check is to plug in a value for x and see if both the original expression and the simplified expression give the same result. Let's pick x = 45 degrees, where sin x = cos x = √2/2, and tan x = 1, cot x = 1.

<prompt_4.4> Verify the simplification by evaluating both the original and simplified expressions using the above plan. </prompt_4.4>

The first term's denominator is sin x cos x, and the second term's denominator is cos x. So, to get the second term to have denominator sin x cos x, we multiply numerator and denominator by sin x. That gives the second term as (sin²x)/(sin x cos x). Therefore, subtracting that from the first term: [1 - sin²x]/(sin x cos x). Yes, that's correct. Then substituting cos²x for 1 - sin²x is correct. Then cancelling a cos x gives cos x / sin x, which is cot x.

<execution_4.2>
Cotangent is the reciprocal of tangent, and it's a standard simplified form. So yes, I think that's the final answer. Let me just confirm once more. Starting with sec x / sin x - sin x / cos x, simplifies to cot x.
</execution_4.2>

<execution_4.3>
That's 1/(sin x cos x) - sin x / cos x. Then, to combine these two terms, we need a common denominator. The first term has denominator sin x cos x, and the second term has denominator cos x. So, to get the same denominator, we multiply the numerator and denominator of the second term by sin x. That gives (sin x * sin x)/(cos x * sin x) = sin²x/(sin x cos x). So subtracting that from the first term: [1 - sin²x]/(sin x cos x). Then, 1 - sin²x is cos²x, so that becomes cos²x/(sin x cos x) = cos x / sin x = cot x.

Let's compute the original expression: sec x / sin x - sin x / cos x. Sec 45 is √2, so √2 / (√2/2) = √2 * 2/√2 = 2. Then, sin x / cos x is 1. So 2 - 1 = 1. The simplified expression is cot x, which is 1. So that matches. Let's try another angle, say x = 30 degrees. Sin 30 is 1/2, cos 30 is √3/2. Sec 30 is 2/√3. So sec x / sin x is (2/√3)/(1/2) = (2/√3)*(2/1) = 4/√3. Then, sin x / cos x is (1/2)/(√3/2) = 1/√3. So subtracting: 4/√3 - 1/√3 = 3/√3 = √3. Cot 30 is indeed √3, so that checks out. Another check: x = 60 degrees. Sec 60 is 2. Sin 60 is √3/2. So sec x / sin x is 2/(√3/2) = 4/√3. Sin x / cos x is (√3/2)/(1/2) = √3. So 4/√3 - √3 = (4/√3 - 3/√3) = 1/√3. Cot 60 is 1/√3, which matches.
