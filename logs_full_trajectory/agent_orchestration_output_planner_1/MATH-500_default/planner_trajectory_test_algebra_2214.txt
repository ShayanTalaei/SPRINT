Okay, let's see. I need to solve the inequality -4 < 2(x - 1) < 8 and express the solution in the form a < x < b, then find a + b. Hmm, inequalities can be a bit tricky sometimes, but let me take it step by step.

First, I remember that solving compound inequalities like this often involves performing the same operations on all three parts to isolate the variable. So, the inequality here is a chain: -4 is less than 2(x - 1), which is also less than 8. My goal is to get x by itself in the middle.

Let me start by looking at the middle part: 2(x - 1). To get rid of the 2 that's multiplied by the parentheses, I should divide all parts of the inequality by 2. That way, I maintain the balance. Let me write that down.

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Dividing each part by 2: -4 รท 2 = -2, 2(x - 1) รท 2 = (x - 1), and 8 รท 2 = 4. So after dividing by 2, the inequality becomes -2 < (x - 1) < 4.

Now, I need to get x by itself. Right now, it's x - 1. To undo that subtraction, I should add 1 to all parts of the inequality. Let's do that.
Adding 1 to each part: -2 + 1 = -1, (x - 1) + 1 = x, and 4 + 1 = 5. So after adding 1, the inequality becomes -1 < x < 5.

Wait, let me check that again. Starting from -4 < 2(x - 1) < 8.
Divide by 2: -2 < x - 1 < 4. Then add 1: -2 +1 = -1, -1 < x < 5.

But let me verify with a number inside the interval and outside to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Let's test x = 0, which should be in the solution.

<prompt_2.1> Verify the solution by testing x = 0, x = 4, and x = -2 within the inequality -4 < 2(x - 1) < 8. </prompt_2.1>

Another way to check is to solve the compound inequality as two separate inequalities.

First inequality: -4 < 2(x - 1). Let's solve this:

<prompt_2.2> Solve the compound inequality -4 < 2(x - 1) < 8 by breaking it into two separate inequalities and find x. </prompt_2.2>

Alternatively, maybe someone could have made a mistake by not reversing the inequality signs when multiplying or dividing by a negative, but in this case, we didn't have to because we divided by positive 2. So no issues there.

Another possible mistake could be miscalculating the addition or division. Let me check the arithmetic again.

<prompt_2.3> Recheck the arithmetic calculations for solving -4 < 2(x - 1) < 8. </prompt_2.3>

Alternatively, if someone incorrectly distributed the 2 first, but that's not necessary here. The 2 is only multiplying (x - 1), so dividing first is more straightforward.

<execution_2.1>
Plugging into 2(x - 1): 2(0 -1) = -2. The original inequality was -4 < -2 < 8. That's true. Now, let's check x = 3, which is inside the solution. 2(3 -1) = 4. Then -4 < 4 < 8? Yes, that's true. What about x = -1, which is the lower bound. 2(-1 -1) = 2(-2) = -4. So the original inequality would be -4 < -4 < 8? Wait, but -4 is not less than -4. It's equal. So x = -1 is not included, which matches the solution -1 < x < 5. Similarly, x =5 would give 2(5 -1) =8, so -4 <8 <8 is false. So the endpoints are excluded, which is correct.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
-4 < 2(x - 1)

Divide both sides by 2: -2 < x - 1

Add 1: -2 + 1 < x => -1 < x

Second inequality: 2(x - 1) < 8

Divide by 2: x - 1 < 4

Add 1: x < 5

So combining both, we get -1 < x < 5.
</execution_2.2>

<execution_2.3>
Original inequality: -4 < 2(x - 1) < 8.

Divide all parts by 2: -4/2 = -2, 2/2 = 1, 8/2 = 4. So, -2 < (x - 1) < 4. Then adding 1: -2 +1 = -1, 4 +1 =5.
</execution_2.3>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Now, to find a + b, where a is -1 and b is 5. So adding them together: -1 + 5 = 4.
So the answer is 4.
-----

Therefore, the value of a + b is 4.

Let me just recap to ensure I didn't skip any steps. The original inequality is a compound inequality, so treating all parts at once is key. Dividing by 2 first, then adding 1.
No negative multiplication, so inequality signs don't flip. Testing values confirmed the solution interval.

**Final Answer**
The value of \(a + b\) is \boxed{4}\).
