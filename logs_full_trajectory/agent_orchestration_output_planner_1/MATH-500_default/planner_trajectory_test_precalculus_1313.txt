<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to find the value of x between 0 and 180 degrees such that the equation tan 53° * tan 81° * tan x° = tan 53° + tan 81° + tan x° holds true. Hmm, trigonometric equation with tangents. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that sometimes when dealing with products and sums of tangents, there might be some trigonometric identities or angle addition formulas that could be helpful. Let me recall some identities.

<prompt_1.1> Recall and list relevant trigonometric identities that might be helpful in solving the equation. </prompt_1.1>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
The tangent of a sum: tan(A + B) = (tan A + tan B) / (1 - tan A tan B). Hmm, that has a sum in the numerator and a product in the denominator. Our equation has a product on one side and a sum on the other. Maybe if I manipulate the equation to relate it to the tangent addition formula?
</execution_1.1>
</Execution_1>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Let me write down the equation again:

tan 53° * tan 81° * tan x° = tan 53° + tan 81° + tan x°.

I need to solve for x. Let's denote tan 53° as a, tan 81° as b, and tan x° as c for simplicity. Then the equation becomes:

a * b * c = a + b + c.

So, a*b*c = a + b + c. Let's rearrange this equation:

a*b*c - a - b - c = 0.

Hmm, maybe factor something out? Not sure. Let's think about possible values of x. Since 53° and 81° are given, maybe x is related to these angles? For example, maybe x is 37°, since 53° + 37° = 90°, or x is 99°, since 81° + 99° = 180°, but I need to check.
Alternatively, maybe using the tangent addition formula. Let's see.

Suppose we consider tan(53° + 81°). But 53° + 81° = 134°, which is not a standard angle, but let's compute tan(134°). Wait, but the formula is tan(A + B) = (tan A + tan B)/(1 - tan A tan B). So if I let A = 53°, B = 81°, then tan(134°) = (tan53 + tan81)/(1 - tan53 tan81). But in our equation, we have tan53 tan81 tanx = tan53 + tan81 + tanx. Let me see if I can relate this to the tangent addition formula.

Let me rearrange the equation:

tan53 tan81 tanx = tan53 + tan81 + tanx.

Divide both sides by tan53 tan81:

tanx = (tan53 + tan81)/tan53 tan81 + 1/(tan53 tan81).

Wait, not sure if that's helpful. Let me try another approach.

<prompt_2.1> Attempt to express tan x in terms of tan 53° and tan 81° using the equation. </prompt_2.1>

Alternatively, maybe consider substituting x such that 53 + 81 + x is 180°, but that would make x = 46°, but 46° is not  the answer, probably.

Alternatively, maybe using the identity for tan(A + B + C). But that might be complicated. Wait, the formula for tan(A + B + C) is (tan A + tan B + tan C - tan A tan B tan C)/(1 - tan A tan B - tan B tan C - tan C tan A). If A + B + C = 180°, then tan(A + B + C) = tan 180° = 0. Therefore, the numerator must be zero:

tan A + tan B + tan C - tan A tan B tan C = 0.

Which implies tan A + tan B + tan C = tan A tan B tan C.

Wait a minute! That's exactly the equation given in the problem. So, if 53° + 81° + x° = 180°, then tan 53° + tan 81° + tan x° = tan 53° tan 81° tan x°. Therefore, x must be such that 53 + 81 + x = 180. Let's compute that.

<prompt_2.2> Solve for x using the condition that 53° + 81° + x° = 180°. </prompt_2.2>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Let's go back to the original equation:

tan53 * tan81 * tanx = tan53 + tan81 + tanx.

Let's isolate tanx. Bring all terms with tanx to one side:

tan53 * tan81 * tanx - tanx = tan53 + tan81.

Factor out tanx:

tanx (tan53 tan81 - 1) = tan53 + tan81.

Then, solving for tanx:

tanx = (tan53 + tan81) / (tan53 tan81 - 1).
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
53 + 81 = 134. So 134 + x = 180 => x = 46. So x is 46 degrees.

Wait, that seems straightforward. So is the answer 46?
</execution_2.2>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.2:
But let me verify if this is correct.

<prompt_3.1> Verify if x = 46° satisfies the original equation. </prompt_3.1>
-----

But let me check another way. Let's compute tan53 * tan81 * tan46 and see if it equals tan53 + tan81 + tan46.

First, compute tan53°, tan81°, tan46°.

<prompt_3.2> Compute tan 53°, tan 81°, and tan 46° using a calculator. </prompt_3.2>

Alternatively, since 53 + 81 + 46 = 180, then indeed, tan53 + tan81 + tan46 = tan53 tan81 tan46, which is exactly the equation given. Therefore, this is a standard trigonometric identity that when A + B + C = 180°, then tanA + tanB + tanC = tanA tanB tanC. So this identity holds for angles that sum to 180°, which is the case here.

Therefore, the answer is x = 46°.

But just to ensure there are no other solutions, let's consider the equation again.

<prompt_3.3> Ensure there are no other solutions for x in the given range. </prompt_3.3>

Hence, x = 46° is the only solution in the range 0 < x < 180.

Wait, but let me check with another approach to be thorough. Let's suppose we didn't recall that identity.

<prompt_3.4> Use the tangent addition formula to solve the equation. </prompt_3.4>

Alternatively, suppose we take the original equation:

tanx = (tan53 + tan81)/(tan53 tan81 - 1).

Compute the right-hand side numerically.

First, compute tan53° and tan81°.

<prompt_3.5> Compute the right-hand side of the equation numerically to verify x. </prompt_3.5>

Another way: Let's suppose we didn't remember the identity. Let's try to manipulate the equation.

Starting with:

tan53 tan81 tanx = tan53 + tan81 + tanx.

Let's move all terms to one side:

tan53 tan81 tanx - tan53 - tan81 - tanx = 0.

Factor terms:

tanx (tan53 tan81 - 1) - (tan53 + tan81) = 0.

Which gives:

tanx = (tan53 + tan81)/(tan53 tan81 - 1).

Which is the same as before.

Alternatively, maybe express tan53 and tan81 in terms of sine and cosine.

<prompt_3.6> Express tan 53° and tan 81° in terms of sine and cosine. </prompt_3.6>

Alternatively, let's consider using the sine and cosine laws. Wait, perhaps not necessary here.

Alternatively, think of 53° and 81° as part of a triangle.

<prompt_3.7> Consider using the sine and cosine laws to solve the problem. </prompt_3.7>

Alternatively, if I didn't recall the identity, but suppose I set x = 46°, then 53 + 81 + 46 = 180, so that satisfies the condition for the identity. Therefore, x must be 46°. Since the identity directly gives the result, there's no need for further computation.

<execution_3.1>
Let's check if this works. Let me compute both sides.

First, compute tan 53°, tan 81°, and tan 46°. Let me use approximate values.

tan 53° ≈ 1.3270 (since tan 53° is approximately 1.3270)
tan 81° ≈ 6.3138 (tan 81° is about 6.3138)
tan 46° ≈ 1.0355 (tan 46° is approximately 1.0355)

Compute the left-hand side (LHS): tan53 * tan81 * tan46 ≈ 1.3270 * 6.3138 * 1.0355.

First multiply 1.3270 and 6.3138: 1.3270 * 6.3138 ≈ 8.333.

Then multiply by 1.0355: 8.333 * 1.0355 ≈ 8.628.

Now the right-hand side (RHS): tan53 + tan81 + tan46 ≈ 1.3270 + 6.3138 + 1.0355 ≈ 8.6763.

Wait, but 8.628 vs 8.6763. These are close but not exactly equal. Hmm, that's odd. Maybe my approximations are off? Let me check with more precise values.

Alternatively, perhaps exact values would work out. Let me check using exact trigonometric identities.

Wait, but maybe my approximate values are causing the discrepancy. Let me compute more accurately.

First, tan 53°: 53 degrees. Let me recall that tan 45° = 1, tan 60° ≈ 1.732. 53° is closer to 45°, but let's use calculator values.

Using a calculator:

tan 53° ≈ 1.327044053823768
tan 81° ≈ 6.313751592532473
tan 46° ≈ 1.0355303137935215

Compute LHS: 1.327044053823768 * 6.313751592532473 * 1.0355303137935215

First multiply 1.327044053823768 and 6.313751592532473:

1.327044053823768 * 6.313751592532473 ≈ Let's compute this step by step.

1.32704405 * 6 = 7.9622643
1.32704405 * 0.31375159 ≈ 1.32704405 * 0.3 = 0.398113215; 1.32704405 * 0.01375159 ≈ 0.018244

So total ≈ 7.9622643 + 0.398113215 + 0.018244 ≈ 8.3786215.

Then multiply by 1.0355303137935215:

8.3786215 * 1.03553031 ≈ 8.3786215 * 1 = 8.3786215; 8.3786215 * 0.03553031 ≈ 0.2975.

Total ≈ 8.3786215 + 0.2975 ≈ 8.6761.

Now compute RHS: tan53 + tan81 + tan46 ≈ 1.32704405 + 6.31375159 + 1.03553031 ≈ 1.32704405 + 6.31375159 = 7.64079564 + 1.03553031 ≈ 8.67632595.

So LHS ≈ 8.6761 and RHS ≈ 8.6763. The slight difference is due to rounding errors in the decimal approximations. Therefore, x = 46° is indeed the solution.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
Let me approximate these values.

First, tan53°. 53 degrees is close to 45°, so tan53 is a bit more than 1. Let's compute it roughly. Using a calculator, tan53° ≈ 1.3270. Similarly, tan81° is very steep, approaching infinity as it approaches 90°. So tan81° ≈ 6.3138. Then tan46° is approximately 1.0355.

So compute left side: tan53 * tan81 * tan46 ≈ 1.3270 * 6.3138 * 1.0355. Let's compute step by step.

First, 1.3270 * 6.3138 ≈ 1.3270 * 6 = 7.962, 1.3270 * 0.3138 ≈ 0.416. So total ≈ 7.962 + 0.416 ≈ 8.378. Then multiply by 1.0355: 8.378 * 1.0355 ≈ 8.378 + 8.378*0.0355 ≈ 8.378 + 0.296 ≈ 8.674.

Now compute right side: tan53 + tan81 + tan46 ≈ 1.3270 + 6.3138 + 1.0355 ≈ 1.3270 + 6.3138 = 7.6408 + 1.0355 ≈ 8.6763. Hmm, that's very close to 8.674. The slight difference is due to rounding errors in the approximate tan values. So this confirms that x = 46° satisfies the equation.
</execution_3.2>

<execution_3.3>
Suppose that 53 + 81 + x = 180, then x = 46. But could there be another x in the range 0 < x < 180 that satisfies the equation without the sum being 180?

Let's see. Let's suppose that x is not 46°, but some other angle. Let's check if the equation can hold. Let's assume that 53 + 81 + x ≠ 180. Then, is there another possibility?

Alternatively, let's suppose that the equation tan A tan B tan C = tan A + tan B + tan C holds when A + B + C = 180°, but are there other cases?

I think that identity is specific to the case when A + B + C = 180°, because it's derived from the tangent addition formula. So unless there's another identity or special case where this holds, x must be 46.
</execution_3.3>

<execution_3.4>
Let's use the equation:

tan53 * tan81 * tanx = tan53 + tan81 + tanx.

Let me compute the left-hand side and right-hand side numerically for x = 46°, to verify.

First, compute tan53°, tan81°, tan46°.

Using calculator:

tan53° ≈ 1.32704 (since tan53 ≈ 1.3270)
tan81° ≈ 6.31385
tan46° ≈ 1.03553

Compute left-hand side: 1.32704 * 6.31385 * 1.03553 ≈ Let's compute step by step.

1.32704 * 6.31385 ≈ 8.333 (exactly 25/3 ≈ 8.3333)

Then 8.3333 * 1.03553 ≈ 8.3333 * 1.03553 ≈ 8.3333 * 1 + 8.3333 * 0.03553 ≈ 8.3333 + 0.296 ≈ 8.6293.

Right-hand side: tan53 + tan81 + tan46 ≈ 1.32704 + 6.31385 + 1.03553 ≈ 1.32704 + 6.31385 = 7.64089 + 1.03553 ≈ 8.67642.

Wait, but 8.6293 vs 8.6764. Hmm, these are close but not exactly equal. That's concerning. Maybe my approximations are off? Let me check with more precise values.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me use exact values.

Alternatively, maybe I need to use exact trigonometric identities.

Wait, but if the identity holds, then 53 + 81 + 46 = 180, so tan53 + tan81 + tan46 = tan53 tan81 tan46. Therefore, the equation is satisfied. So there must be some calculation error in the approximate values.

Let me check with more precise calculator values.

Compute tan53°:

53 degrees in radians is 53 * π/180 ≈ 0.9250 radians.

tan(0.9250) ≈ 1.32704 (using calculator). Similarly, tan81°:

81 degrees in radians ≈ 1.4137 radians.

tan(1.4137) ≈ 6.31385. tan46° ≈ 1.03553.

So, compute left-hand side: 1.32704 * 6.31385 * 1.03553.

First, 1.32704 * 6.31385:

Let's compute 1.32704 * 6 = 7.96224

1.32704 * 0.31385 ≈ 1.32704 * 0.3 = 0.398112; 1.32704 * 0.01385 ≈ 0.01845

So total ≈ 0.398112 + 0.01845 ≈ 0.41656

Therefore, total ≈ 7.96224 + 0.41656 ≈ 8.3788

Then multiply by 1.03553:

8.3788 * 1.03553 ≈ 8.3788 + 8.3788 * 0.03553 ≈ 8.3788 + 0.297 ≈ 8.6758

Now, right-hand side: tan53 + tan81 + tan46 ≈ 1.32704 + 6.31385 + 1.03553 ≈ 1.32704 + 6.31385 = 7.64089 + 1.03553 ≈ 8.67642.

So left-hand side ≈ 8.6758, right-hand side ≈ 8.6764. These are extremely close, considering the approximations. So the equality holds. Therefore, x = 46° is indeed the solution.

Therefore, the answer is 46 degrees.
</execution_3.4>

<execution_3.5>
Calculating tan53°: Using a calculator, tan53° ≈ 1.3270.

Calculating tan81°: tan81° ≈ 6.3138.

Now compute numerator: 1.3270 + 6.3138 ≈ 7.6408.

Denominator: (1.3270 * 6.3138) - 1. Let's compute 1.3270 * 6.3138. 1.3 * 6.3 ≈ 8.19, but more accurately:

1.3270 * 6.3138 ≈ (1 + 0.3270) * 6.3138 ≈ 6.3138 + 0.3270*6.3138 ≈ 6.3138 + 2.066 ≈ 8.3798. Then subtract 1: 8.3798 - 1 = 7.3798.

So tanx ≈ 7.6408 / 7.3798 ≈ 1.036.

Now, tan46° ≈ 1.0355. That's very close. So tanx ≈ 1.036, which is approximately tan46°, considering rounding errors. Therefore, x ≈ 46°, which is exact. Therefore, x = 46.
</execution_3.5>

<execution_3.6>
But that might complicate things. Let's see:

tan53 = sin53 / cos53, tan81 = sin81 / cos81.

So, tan53 + tan81 = (sin53 / cos53) + (sin81 / cos81) = [sin53 cos81 + sin81 cos53] / (cos53 cos81).

The numerator is sin(53 + 81) = sin134°, using the sine addition formula: sin(A + B) = sinA cosB + cosA sinB. Wait, actually, sin(A + B) = sinA cosB + cosA sinB. So, sin53 cos81 + sin81 cos53 = sin(53 + 81) = sin134°. Therefore, tan53 + tan81 = sin134° / (cos53 cos81).

Similarly, tan53 tan81 = (sin53 / cos53)(sin81 / cos81) = (sin53 sin81) / (cos53 cos81).

Therefore, tan53 tan81 - 1 = [sin53 sin81 / (cos53 cos81)] - 1 = [sin53 sin81 - cos53 cos81] / (cos53 cos81).

But the numerator here is -[cos53 cos81 - sin53 sin81] = -cos(53 + 81) = -cos134°, using the cosine addition formula: cos(A + B) = cosA cosB - sinA sinB. Therefore, cos53 cos81 - sin53 sin81 = cos(53 + 81) = cos134°, so the numerator becomes -cos134°, hence:

tan53 tan81 - 1 = -cos134° / (cos53 cos81).

Therefore, the denominator of tanx is -cos134° / (cos53 cos81), and the numerator was sin134° / (cos53 cos81). Therefore, tanx = [sin134 / (cos53 cos81)] / [ -cos134 / (cos53 cos81) ] = sin134 / (-cos134) = -tan134.

But tanx = -tan134 = tan(-134°). However, since tangent is periodic with period 180°, tan(-134°) = tan(180° - 134°) = tan46°. Because tan(180° - θ) = -tanθ, so tan(-134°) = -tan134° = tan(46°). Therefore, tanx = tan46°, so x = 46° + k*180°. But since 0 < x < 180, the only solution is x = 46°.
</execution_3.6>

<execution_3.7>
But perhaps overcomplicating.

Alternatively, note that 53° and 37° are complementary to 37° and 53°, since 53 + 37 = 90. Similarly, 81° and 9° are complementary. But not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, let's compute the numerical values.

Compute tan53°, tan81°, and then compute the right-hand side of the equation tanx = (tan53 + tan81)/(tan53 tan81 - 1), then take arctangent to find x.

Let's compute tan53°. 53 degrees is close to 45°, so tan53 is approximately 1.327 (since tan53 ≈ 1.327). Wait, actually, exact value is not necessary. Let me use calculator values.

Compute tan53°:

tan(53°) ≈ 1.327044.

tan(81°) ≈ 6.3137515.

Compute numerator: tan53 + tan81 ≈ 1.327044 + 6.3137515 ≈ 7.6407955.

Compute denominator: tan53 * tan81 - 1 ≈ (1.327044 * 6.3137515) - 1.

First, multiply 1.327044 * 6.3137515:

1.327044 * 6 ≈ 7.962264

1.327044 * 0.3137515 ≈ approx 1.327044 * 0.3 = 0.3981132, and 1.327044 * 0.0137515 ≈ ~0.01824.

So total ≈ 0.3981132 + 0.01824 ≈ 0.41635.

So total product ≈ 7.962264 + 0.41635 ≈ 8.378614.

Therefore, denominator ≈ 8.378614 - 1 = 7.378614.

Therefore, tanx ≈ 7.6407955 / 7.378614 ≈ 1.0365.

Now, compute arctangent of 1.0365. Since tan45° = 1, tan46° ≈ 1.0355, tan47° ≈ 1.07237. So 1.0365 is very close to tan46°, which is approximately 1.0355. So 1.0365 would correspond to about 46.05°, which is very close to 46°. Considering possible rounding errors in the decimal approximations, the exact value is 46°.
