</Question>

<think>
<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to find all possible values of the expression \(\frac{c}{a} + \frac{a}{b + c} + \frac{b}{c}\) where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are positive real numbers. Hmm, let's see. I remember that for inequalities involving variables in fractions like this, techniques like the AM-GM inequality or Cauchy-Schwarz might be useful. But first, maybe I should try to see if there's a way to simplify or manipulate the expression to make it more manageable.
Let me write down the expression again:

\[
\frac{c}{a} + \frac{a}{b + c} + \frac{b}{c}
\]

I notice that each term is a fraction where the numerator and denominator are different variables or combinations. Maybe substituting variables could help. Let me set some substitutions to reduce the number of variables. Let's say, let \(x = \frac{c}{a}\), \(y = \frac{a}{b + c}\), and \(z = \frac{b}{c}\). Then the expression becomes \(x + y + z\). But I need to see if there's a relationship between \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) that can be exploited.

First, let's express each substitution in terms of the original variables:

<prompt_1.1> Express the substitutions \(x = \frac{c}{a}\), \(y = \frac{a}{b + c}\), and \(z = \frac{b}{c}\) in terms of the original variables. </prompt_1.1>
-----

Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by setting variables in terms of a single variable to see if the expression can take any value above 2. Let's suppose that \(a = c\), so that the first term \(\frac{c}{a} = 1\). Then the expression becomes \(1 + \frac{a}{b + a} + \frac{b}{a}\).

<prompt_1.2> Assume \(a = c\) and analyze the expression to see if it can take any value above 2. </prompt_1.2>

Alternatively, suppose we set \(b\) to be very small compared to \(a\) and \(c\). Let's say \(b \to 0\). Then the expression becomes \(\frac{c}{a} + \frac{a}{0 + c} + 0\), which simplifies to \(\frac{c}{a} + \frac{a}{c}\).

<prompt_1.3> Analyze the expression when \(b\) is very small compared to \(a\) and \(c\). </prompt_1.3>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
1. \(x = \frac{c}{a}\) implies \(c = a x\).
2. \(y = \frac{a}{b + c}\). Since \(c = a x\), this becomes \(y = \frac{a}{b + a x}\).
3. \(z = \frac{b}{c} = \frac{b}{a x}\), so \(b = a x z\).

So substituting \(b = a x z\) into the expression for \(y\):

\[
y = \frac{a}{a x z + a x} = \frac{1}{a x z + a x} \times a = \frac{1}{x z + x} \times \frac{a}{a} = \frac{1}{x(z + 1)}
\]

Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me check that again. If \(b = a x z\), then substituting into \(y = \frac{a}{b + c}\):

\[
y = \frac{a}{a x z + a x} = \frac{a}{a x (z + 1)} = \frac{1}{x (z + 1)}
\]

Ah, yes, that's correct. So \(y = \frac{1}{x(z + 1)}\).

So now, our original expression \(x + y + z\) becomes:

\[
x + \frac{1}{x(z + 1)} + z
\]

But now, we have \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) related through these substitutions. However, this might not be the easiest way to proceed because there are still multiple variables involved. Maybe another approach is needed.
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
Let me denote \(t = \frac{b}{a}\), so that \(b = a t\). Then substituting, the expression becomes \(1 + \frac{a}{a t + a} + \frac{a t}{a} = 1 + \frac{1}{t + 1} + t\). So now, we have the expression \(1 + \frac{1}{t + 1} + t\) where \(t > 0\). Let's analyze this function of \(t\):

Let \(f(t) = 1 + \frac{1}{t + 1} + t\). Then, \(f(t) = t + \frac{1}{t + 1} + 1\). Let's compute its derivative to find minima and maxima. The derivative \(f'(t) = 1 - \frac{1}{(t + 1)^2}\). Setting this equal to zero:

\(1 - \frac{1}{(t + 1)^2} = 0 \implies (t + 1)^2 = 1 \implies t + 1 = 1\) (since \(t + 1 > 0\)), so \(t = 0\). But \(t > 0\), so the minimum occurs as \(t\) approaches 0. Let's check the limit as \(t \to 0^+\):

\(f(t) \to 0 + 1 + 1 = 2\). Wait, but \(t = 0\) would mean \(b = 0\), which is not allowed since \(b\) is positive. So the infimum is 2, but it's not attainable. However, when \(t\) approaches 0, \(b\) approaches 0, but remains positive. So in this case, the expression can get arbitrarily close to 2, but not less than 2. On the other hand, as \(t\) approaches infinity, \(f(t) = t + \frac{1}{t + 1} + 1 \approx t + 1\), which goes to infinity. Therefore, in this scenario, the expression can take any value greater than 2.
</execution_1.2>

<execution_1.3>
Since \(b\) is positive but approaching zero, the third term \(\frac{b}{c}\) approaches 0. So, in this case, the expression reduces to \(\frac{c}{a} + \frac{a}{c}\). Let me set \(t = \frac{c}{a}\), so the expression becomes \(t + \frac{1}{t}\). We know from the AM-GM inequality that \(t + \frac{1}{t} \geq 2\), with equality when \(t = 1\), i.e., when \(c = a\). So in this case, as \(b\) approaches 0, the expression can get arbitrarily close to 2. But since \(b\) must be positive, it can't actually reach 2. However, by making \(b\) very small, we can make the expression as close to 2 as desired.
</execution_1.3>
</Execution_1>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Maybe trying to apply AM-GM here. Let's recall that the AM-GM inequality states that for non-negative real numbers, the arithmetic mean is at least the geometric mean. So perhaps if I can express the terms in a way that allows me to apply AM-GM.

Looking at the three terms: \(\frac{c}{a}\), \(\frac{a}{b + c}\), and \(\frac{b}{c}\). Let me see if I can relate these terms or find a relationship between them.

Alternatively, maybe substituting variables to reduce the number of variables. For example, set \(x = \frac{c}{a}\) and \(y = \frac{b}{c}\).

<prompt_2.1> Substitute variables \(x = \frac{c}{a}\) and \(y = \frac{b}{c}\) and analyze the expression. </prompt_2.1>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Then, the expression becomes:

\[
x + \frac{a}{b + c} + y
\]

But let's express \(a\) and \(b\) in terms of \(x\) and \(y\). Since \(x = \frac{c}{a}\), we have \(a = \frac{c}{x}\). Similarly, \(y = \frac{b}{c}\), so \(b = y c\). Then, substituting into \(\frac{a}{b + c}\):

\[
\frac{\frac{c}{x}}{y c + c} = \frac{\frac{c}{x}}{c(y + 1)} = \frac{1}{x(y + 1)}
\]

So the entire expression becomes:

\[
x + \frac{1}{x(y + 1)} + y
\]

Now, this is an expression in terms of \(x\) and \(y\), both of which are positive real numbers. Maybe this is easier to handle. Let's denote this as \(E = x + y + \frac{1}{x(y + 1)}\).
</execution_2.1>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Hmm, perhaps we can fix one variable and optimize over the other. For example, fix \(x\) and find the minimum over \(y\), or vice versa.

Alternatively, maybe set \(x = y\) to see if symmetry helps. Let's try that.

<prompt_3.1> Try setting \(x = y\) and analyze the expression. </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
If \(x = y\), then the expression becomes:

\[
2x + \frac{1}{x(x + 1)} = 2x + \frac{1}{x^2 + x}
\]

This might not be straightforward. Let's consider taking the derivative with respect to \(x\). Let \(f(x) = 2x + \frac{1}{x^2 + x}\). Then,

\[
f'(x) = 2 - \frac{2x + 1}{(x^2 + x)^2}
\]

Setting this equal to zero:

\[
2 = \frac{2x + 1}{(x^2 + x)^2}
\]

This seems complicated. Maybe this approach isn't the most efficient.
</execution_3.1>
</Execution_3>

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
Let me think of another approach. Maybe using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.

<prompt_4.1> Consider using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality on the expression. </prompt_4.1>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for positive real numbers, \((\sum a_i b_i)^2 \leq (\sum a_i^2)(\sum b_i^2)\), but I'm not sure how directly applicable that is here. Alternatively, the Titu's lemma, which is a form of Cauchy-Schwarz, might help with the fractions. Titu's lemma states that \(\sum \frac{x_i^2}{a_i} \geq \frac{(\sum x_i)^2}{\sum a_i}\).

Looking at the expression, perhaps I can apply Titu's lemma to the terms \(\frac{c}{a}\) and \(\frac{a}{b + c}\). Wait, but they are not in the form of squares over something. Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the expression to fit into Titu's lemma. Alternatively, consider the entire expression and see if it can be bounded below by 2.

Wait, let's test with some specific values. Let me choose \(a = b = c\). Let's say \(a = b = c = 1\). Then the expression becomes \(\frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{1 + 1} + \frac{1}{1} = 1 + 0.5 + 1 = 2.5\). So 2.5 is achievable.
</execution_4.1>
</Execution_4>

<Plan_5>
Based on execution_4.1:
Maybe the minimal value is 2? But when I set \(a = b = c\), I get 2.5, which is above 2. Earlier, when I considered \(b\) approaching zero, the expression approached 2. So perhaps 2 is the lower bound, but not attainable.

Wait, but how can we formally show that the expression is always greater than 2 and can get arbitrarily close to 2?

Let's try to use the AM-GM inequality on parts of the expression.

Looking at the three terms: \(\frac{c}{a}\), \(\frac{a}{b + c}\), and \(\frac{b}{c}\). Let's see if we can apply AM-GM to these three terms.

<prompt_5.1> Apply the AM-GM inequality to the expression and analyze the result. </prompt_5.1>

But we need to check if equality can be achieved. For equality in AM-GM, all terms must be equal.

<prompt_5.2> Check if equality can be achieved in the AM-GM inequality. </prompt_5.2>

But in reality, equality cannot be achieved because \(b\) has to be positive. However, we can make \(b\) as small as we like, making the expression approach 2. Hence, the infimum is 2, but it's not attainable. Therefore, the set of possible values is \((2, \infty)\).

Wait, but let's verify this with another approach. Suppose we set \(c = a\), as before, then the expression becomes \(1 + \frac{a}{b + a} + \frac{b}{a}\). Let me denote \(t = \frac{b}{a}\), so \(t > 0\). Then the expression becomes:

<prompt_5.3> Verify the result using another approach and confirm the set of possible values. </prompt_5.3>
</Plan_5>

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
By AM-GM, we have:

\[
\frac{\frac{c}{a} + \frac{a}{b + c} + \frac{b}{c}}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{\frac{c}{a} \cdot \frac{a}{b + c} \cdot \frac{b}{c}} = \sqrt[3]{\frac{c}{a} \cdot \frac{a}{b + c} \cdot \frac{b}{c}} = \sqrt[3]{\frac{b}{(b + c)}}
\]

Wait, simplifying the product inside the cube root:

\[
\frac{c}{a} \cdot \frac{a}{b + c} \cdot \frac{b}{c} = \frac{c \cdot a \cdot b}{a \cdot (b + c) \cdot c} = \frac{b}{b + c}
\]

So the AM-GM inequality gives:

\[
\frac{\text{Expression}}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{\frac{b}{b + c}}
\]

Which implies:

\[
\text{Expression} \geq 3 \sqrt[3]{\frac{b}{b + c}}
\]

But this doesn't seem helpful because \(\frac{b}{b + c}\) is less than 1, so the cube root is also less than 1, making the right-hand side less than 3. In fact, this suggests a lower bound less than 3, which contradicts our earlier observation that the expression can get close to 2. So maybe AM-GM isn't the right tool here, or perhaps I need a different approach.
</execution_5.1>

<execution_5.2>
However, the terms are \(\frac{c}{a}\), \(\frac{a}{b + c}\), and \(\frac{b}{c}\). If we set \(\frac{c}{a} = \frac{a}{b + c} = \frac{b}{c}\), let's see what that implies.

Let all three terms equal to \(k\). Then:

1. \(\frac{c}{a} = k \implies c = a k\)
2. \(\frac{a}{b + c} = k \implies a = k(b + c) = k(b + a k)\)
3. \(\frac{b}{c} = k \implies b = c k = a k^2\)

From equation 3, \(b = a k^2\). Substitute this into equation 2:

\(a = k(b + a k) = k(a k^2 + a k) = k a (k^2 + k)\)

Divide both sides by \(a\) (since \(a > 0\)):

\(1 = k (k^2 + k) = k^3 + k^2\)

Thus, we have the equation \(k^3 + k^2 - 1 = 0\). Let's solve this equation for \(k > 0\). Let's check \(k = 0.5\): \(0.125 + 0.25 - 1 = -0.625\). \(k = 1\): \(1 + 1 - 1 = 1\). So there is a root between 0.5 and 1. Let's approximate it. Let \(f(k) = k^3 + k^2 - 1\).

Using Newton-Raphson method: starting with \(k_0 = 0.75\).

\(f(0.75) = 0.421875 + 0.5625 - 1 = 0.984375 - 1 = -0.015625\)

\(f'(k) = 3k^2 + 2k\), so \(f'(0.75) = 3*(0.5625) + 2*(0.75) = 1.6875 + 1.5 = 3.1875\)

Next iteration: \(k_1 = 0.75 - (-0.015625)/3.1875 ≈ 0.75 + 0.0049 ≈ 0.7549\)

Compute \(f(0.7549)\):

\(0.7549^3 + 0.7549^2 - 1 ≈ (0.4309) + (0.5699) - 1 ≈ 0.9999 - 1 ≈ -0.0001\). So very close to root. Therefore, the root is approximately 0.7549.

Thus, equality in AM-GM is not possible here since it would require \(k ≈ 0.7549\), but the variables would have to satisfy that, which might not be possible due to the interdependencies. Therefore, the minimum is not 3, but higher.
</execution_5.2>

<execution_5.3>
\[
1 + \frac{1}{1 + t} + t
\]

Let's analyze this function \(f(t) = t + \frac{1}{1 + t} + 1\) for \(t > 0\). Taking the derivative:

\[
f'(t) = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + t)^2}
\]

Setting this equal to zero:

\[
1 - \frac{1}{(1 + t)^2} = 0 \implies (1 + t)^2 = 1 \implies 1 + t = 1 \implies t = 0
\]

But \(t = 0\) is not allowed since \(b\) must be positive. Therefore, the minimum occurs as \(t\) approaches 0, which gives \(f(t) \to 1 + 1 + 0 = 2\). So again, this suggests that the expression can get arbitrarily close to 2 but never actually reaches it. Therefore, the lower bound is 2, and there's no upper bound because as \(t\) increases, \(f(t)\) increases without bound. For example, if \(t\) approaches infinity, \(f(t) \approx t + 1\), which goes to infinity. Therefore, the expression can take any value greater than 2.
</execution_5.3>
</Execution_5>

<Plan_6>
Based on execution_5.3:
But let's check another case where two variables are equal, but not necessarily \(a = c\). Let's suppose \(a = c\), but \(b\) is different. Wait, I already did that in the previous step. Alternatively, set \(a = b\). Let me try that.

<prompt_6.1> Test the expression with \(a = b\) and analyze the results. </prompt_6.1>

Alternatively, set \(c = b\). Let's see. If \(c = b\), then the expression becomes:

<prompt_6.2> Test the expression with \(c = b\) and confirm the results. </prompt_6.2>
</Plan_6>

<Execution_6>
<execution_6.1>
Let \(a = b\). Then the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{c}{a} + \frac{a}{a + c} + \frac{a}{c}
\]

Let me set \(a = 1\) for simplicity. Then, the expression is \(c + \frac{1}{1 + c} + \frac{1}{c}\). Let's denote this as \(f(c) = c + \frac{1}{1 + c} + \frac{1}{c}\). Let's analyze this function for \(c > 0\).

Compute the derivative:

\[
f'(c) = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + c)^2} - \frac{1}{c^2}
\]

Set this equal to zero:

\[
1 = \frac{1}{(1 + c)^2} + \frac{1}{c^2}
\]

This seems complicated to solve, but maybe we can find critical points numerically. Let's try \(c = 1\):

\[
\frac{1}{(2)^2} + \frac{1}{1} = \frac{1}{4} + 1 = \frac{5}{4} > 1
\]

So the left side is greater than 1. Let's try \(c = 2\):

\[
\frac{1}{9} + \frac{1}{4} ≈ 0.111 + 0.25 = 0.361 < 1
\]

So by Intermediate Value Theorem, there is a root between 1 and 2. Let's try \(c = 1.5\):

\[
\frac{1}{(2.5)^2} + \frac{1}{(1.5)^2} = \frac{1}{6.25} + \frac{1}{2.25} ≈ 0.16 + 0.444 ≈ 0.604 < 1
\]

Still less than 1. Try \(c = 1.2\):

\[
\frac{1}{(2.2)^2} + \frac{1}{(1.2)^2} ≈ \frac{1}{4.84} + \frac{1}{1.44} ≈ 0.2066 + 0.6944 ≈ 0.901 ≈ 0.901 < 1
\]

Close. Try \(c = 1.1\):

\[
\frac{1}{(2.1)^2} + \frac{1}{(1.1)^2} ≈ \frac{1}{4.41} + \frac{1}{1.21} ≈ 0.2268 + 0.8264 ≈ 1.0532 > 1
\]

So the root is between 1.1 and 1.2. Let's approximate. Let \(c = 1.15\):

\[
\frac{1}{(2.15)^2} + \frac{1}{(1.15)^2} ≈ \frac{1}{4.6225} + \frac{1}{1.3225} ≈ 0.2163 + 0.7563 ≈ 0.9726 < 1
\]

c = 1.125:

\[
\frac{1}{(2.125)^2} + \frac{1}{(1.125)^2} ≈ \frac{1}{4.5156} + \frac{1}{1.2656} ≈ 0.2214 + 0.7895 ≈ 1.0109 > 1
\]

So the root is between 1.125 and 1.15. Let's say approximately 1.135. Then, the minimum value of \(f(c)\) at this critical point would be:

\(c + \frac{1}{1 + c} + \frac{1}{c}\). Plugging in \(c ≈ 1.135\):

\(1.135 + \frac{1}{2.135} + \frac{1}{1.135} ≈ 1.135 + 0.468 + 0.881 ≈ 2.484\). So the minimum in this case is around 2.484, which is higher than 2. This again suggests that the expression can take values starting from above 2, but when we set \(b\) approaching zero, the expression approaches 2. Therefore, 2 is the infimum.
</execution_6.1>

<execution_6.2>
\[
\frac{b}{a} + \frac{a}{b + b} + \frac{b}{b} = \frac{b}{a} + \frac{a}{2b} + 1
\]

Let \(t = \frac{b}{a}\), so \(t > 0\). Then the expression becomes:

\[
t + \frac{1}{2t} + 1
\]

Let \(f(t) = t + \frac{1}{2t} + 1\). Taking derivative:

\(f'(t) = 1 - \frac{1}{2t^2}\). Setting to zero:

\(1 - \frac{1}{2t^2} = 0 \implies 2t^2 = 1 \implies t = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\)

So minimum at \(t = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\):

\(f\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{1}{2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}} + 1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + 1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + 1 = \sqrt{2} + 1 \approx 2.4142\)

So in this case, the minimum is approximately 2.4142, which is higher than 2. But when we set \(b\) very small, the expression can approach 2. Therefore, 2 is still the infimum.
</execution_6.2>
</Execution_6>

<Plan_7>
Based on execution_6.1, execution_6.2, execution_5.3:
Therefore, putting all this together, it seems that the expression \(\frac{c}{a} + \frac{a}{b + c} + \frac{b}{c}\) can take any value greater than 2, but cannot be less than or equal to 2. The infimum is 2, but it's not attainable since \(b\) must be positive. Therefore, the set of all possible values is the interval \((2, \infty)\).

To confirm this, let's consider if there's any other approach that might yield a different result. For example, using the method of Lagrange multipliers to find the minimum of the expression under the constraint that \(a, b, c > 0\). However, since there are no equality constraints, only inequalities, the minimum is approached as \(b \to 0\), which we've already considered.

Another approach is to use substitution to reduce variables. Let me try setting \(a = c = 1\) and vary \(b\). Then the expression becomes:

<prompt_7.1> Confirm the results using the expression with \(a = c = 1\) and varying \(b\). </prompt_7.1>

Alternatively, set \(a = 1\), \(c = t\), and \(b = \epsilon\), where \(t\) and \(\epsilon\) are positive real numbers. Then the expression becomes:

<prompt_7.2> Explore the expression by setting \(a = 1\), \(c = t\), and \(b = \epsilon\), and analyze the limit as \(\epsilon \to 0\). </prompt_7.2>

Therefore, the set of possible values is all real numbers greater than 2. Hence, the answer should be that the set of all possible values is the open interval \((2, \infty)\).
**Final Answer**
The set of all possible values is the open interval \(\boxed{(2, \infty)}\).
