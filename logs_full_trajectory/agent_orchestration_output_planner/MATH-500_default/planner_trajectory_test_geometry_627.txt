The coordinates of a parallelogram are (5, 3), (6, 8), (7, 4) and $(x, y)$ and $x > 7$. What is the value of $x + y$?
</Question>

<think>
<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to find the coordinates (x, y) of the fourth vertex of a parallelogram, given three vertices: (5, 3), (6, 8), and (7, 4). Also, it's specified that x > 7. Then, I have to find x + y. Hmm, let's think step by step.

First, I remember that in a parallelogram, the opposite sides are equal and parallel, and the diagonals bisect each other. That means the midpoints of the diagonals should be the same. Maybe I can use the midpoint formula here.

The midpoint formula is ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2). So, if I consider two pairs of opposite vertices, their midpoints should coincide.

Let me label the given points for clarity. Let's say A(5,3), B(6,8), C(7,4), and D(x,y). Now, depending on how the points are connected, D could be the fourth vertex in different positions. Since x > 7, D is to the right of point C(7,4).
So, maybe the order of the points is A, B, C, D? Or perhaps it's A, B, D, C? Wait, not sure. Maybe I need to consider different cases.

In a parallelogram, the vectors AB and DC should be equal, and vectors AD and BC should be equal. Alternatively, the vector approach might help here.

Let me recall that in a parallelogram, the vector from one vertex to another should be the same as the vector from the opposite vertex to its next vertex. So, for example, vector AB should equal vector DC, and vector AD should equal vector BC.

First, let's compute the vectors between the given points.

Alternatively, using the midpoint method. Let's see.

If we consider the diagonals of the parallelogram. The diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other, so the midpoints of the diagonals must be the same.

<prompt_1.2> Use the midpoint method to find the possible coordinates of the fourth vertex. </prompt_1.2>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
Vector AB = B - A = (6-5, 8-3) = (1,5)

Vector AC = C - A = (7-5,4-3) = (2,1)

Wait, but if we are to find point D, we need to figure out how these vectors relate. Let's assume that the points are in order A, B, C, D. Then, vector AB should equal vector DC, and vector BC should equal vector AD.

But wait, if we take points A, B, C, D in order, then:

AB = (1,5), so DC should also be (1,5). Since C is (7,4), then D = C - AB = (7 -1, 4 -5) = (6, -1). But x in this case would be 6, which is not greater than 7. So this can't be the correct position for D.
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
So, if we pair A and C as one diagonal, then the midpoint of AC should be the same as the midpoint of BD. Let's compute that.

Midpoint of AC: ((5 + 7)/2, (3 + 4)/2) = (12/2, 7/2) = (6, 3.5)

Midpoint of BD: ((6 + x)/2, (8 + y)/2). Setting this equal to (6, 3.5):

(6 + x)/2 = 6 => 6 + x = 12 => x = 6

(8 + y)/2 = 3.5 => 8 + y = 7 => y = -1

But x = 6, which is not greater than 7. So this case is invalid.
</execution_1.2>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Maybe the order is different.

Alternatively, suppose the points are A, B, D, C. Then, vector AB = vector DC. Let's see.

<prompt_2.1> Calculate the vectors for different orders of points to find the correct position for point D. </prompt_2.1>

Based on execution_1.2:
Case 2: If we take another pair of diagonals, say A and B as one diagonal, and C and D as the other.

<prompt_2.2> Use the midpoint method with different diagonals to find the possible coordinates of the fourth vertex. </prompt_2.2>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
If AB = DC, then vector AB = (1,5). Since D is (x,y), then vector DC = C - D = (7 - x, 4 - y). This should equal AB = (1,5). Therefore:

7 - x = 1 => x = 6

4 - y = 5 => y = -1

Again, x = 6, which is less than 7. Not acceptable.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Wait, no. In a parallelogram, the diagonals are between opposite vertices. So if the vertices are in order A, B, C, D, then diagonals are AC and BD. But if the order is different, maybe the diagonals are AB and CD? Wait, no. The diagonals connect opposite vertices. So regardless of the order, the diagonals must be between vertices that are not adjacent.

Wait, perhaps I need to clarify.

Suppose the vertices are labeled in order A, B, C, D, going around the parallelogram. Then the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. The diagonals are AC and BD. So their midpoints must coincide.

But if the order is different, the diagonals could be different. For example, if the points are A, C, B, D, then the diagonals would be AB and CD. Hmm, this is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe there are three possible positions for the fourth vertex, depending on which two sides are considered as adjacent. Let me recall that given three vertices of a parallelogram, there are three possible positions for the fourth vertex. The formula for the missing vertex is: if the points are A, B, C, then the fourth vertex can be found as A + B - C, or B + C - A, or A + C - B. Wait, is that correct?

Yes, in general, for three vertices of a parallelogram, the fourth vertex can be found using vector addition. If we have points A, B, C, then the fourth point D can be A + C - B, or B + C - A, etc. Wait, let me verify.

Suppose in a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other. So the midpoint of AC is the same as the midpoint of BD. So, midpoint of AC is ( (Ax + Cx)/2, (Ay + Cy)/2 ), and midpoint of BD is ( (Bx + Dx)/2, (By + Dy)/2 ). Therefore, setting them equal:

(Dx, Dy) = (Cx + Bx - Ax, Cy + By - Ay)

So, D = (Cx + Bx - Ax, Cy + By - Ay)

Alternatively, if we consider another diagonal, say AB and CD, then the midpoint of AB should equal the midpoint of CD. So midpoint of AB is ((Ax + Bx)/2, (Ay + By)/2 ), and midpoint of CD is ((Cx + Dx)/2, (Cy + Dy)/2 ). Therefore:

(Dx, Dy) = (Bx + Cx - Ax, By + Cy - Ay)

Wait, so depending on which diagonal we take, the formula for D is different. Therefore, there are two possible fourth vertices? Wait, but maybe three?

Wait, no. Let me think. If we fix three points, A, B, C, then the fourth point can be found in three different ways, depending on which two points are considered as a diagonal.

Wait, let me check with the general formula. If three points are given, there are three possible ways to pair them as diagonals, leading to three possible fourth vertices. However, in a parallelogram, only one of them will form a valid parallelogram. Wait, maybe not. Let me see.

Wait, the general formula for the fourth vertex given three vertices A, B, C is:

D1 = A + B - C

D2 = B + C - A

D3 = A + C - B

So, three possible points. So, depending on which two points are considered adjacent and which is the opposite, we get different fourth points. So, in this problem, since they say the coordinates are (5,3), (6,8), (7,4), and (x,y), with x >7, so we need to compute all three possibilities and see which one has x >7.

Let me compute these three possibilities.

Based on execution_2.1:
Let's try another approach.

Vector BC = C - B = (7 - 6, 4 - 8) = (1, -4)

If vector BC is equal to vector AD, then vector AD = (1, -4). Since point A is (5,3), then point D = A + vector AD = (5 +1, 3 + (-4)) = (6, -1). Again, x=6 <7.

Hmm, same result. Not acceptable.

Maybe the other way around. If vector AB equals vector DC, and vector BC equals vector AD, but arranging the points differently.

Based on execution_2.2:
First, let's label the given points:

A(5,3), B(6,8), C(7,4). Let's compute D1, D2, D3.

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
Suppose the points are arranged as A, B, D, C. Then, sides AB and BD and DC and CA? Hmm, maybe not. Let's think about the order.

Alternatively, maybe the order is A, C, B, D. Wait, this is getting confusing. Perhaps I need to use the vector approach more carefully.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
D1 = A + B - C = (5 + 6 -7, 3 +8 -4) = (4,7)

D2 = B + C - A = (6 +7 -5,8 +4 -3) = (8,9)

D3 = A + C - B = (5 +7 -6,3 +4 -8) = (6, -1)

So the three possible fourth vertices are (4,7), (8,9), and (6,-1). Now, among these, which one has x >7?

Looking at the points, D1 is (4,7) which has x=4, too small. D3 is (6,-1), x=6, still too small. Only D2 is (8,9), where x=8, which is greater than 7. Therefore, the missing point is (8,9), so x + y = 8 +9 =17.

Based on execution_3.2:
But wait, let me verify if this indeed forms a parallelogram.

Let's check the vectors.

<prompt_4.1> Verify the solution by checking the distances between the points to ensure they form a parallelogram. </prompt_4.1>

Alternatively, using midpoints. If D is (8,9), then diagonals would be AC and BD. Midpoint of AC is ((5+7)/2, (3+4)/2) = (6, 3.5). Midpoint of BD is ((6+8)/2, (8+9)/2) = (7, 8.5). Wait, that's not the same. Wait, that contradicts.

<prompt_4.2> Verify the midpoint method to ensure the diagonals bisect each other. </prompt_4.2>

Wait, but if D is (8,9), then the diagonals would be AD and BC? Let me check midpoints.

<prompt_4.3> Verify the midpoint method with different diagonals to ensure the correct parallelogram. </prompt_4.3>

But why did the midpoint method earlier give a different result? Because when I took diagonals AC and BD, their midpoints didn't coincide. But in reality, if the fourth point is (8,9), then the diagonals are AB and CD. Wait, let's check that.

<prompt_4.4> Re-evaluate the midpoint method with different diagonals to ensure consistency. </prompt_4.4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
If D2 is (8,9), then let's check the vectors. Let's assume the order of the points is A(5,3), B(6,8), C(7,4), D(8,9). Wait, but how are they connected? Let's see.

If it's a parallelogram, then vectors AB and DC should be equal. Vector AB is (1,5). Vector DC is C - D = (7 -8, 4 -9) = (-1, -5). That's not equal to AB. Hmm, so that's a problem. Alternatively, maybe the order is different.

Alternatively, if the points are A, B, D, C. Then vectors AB and DC. AB is (1,5). DC is C - D = (7 -8,4 -9)= (-1,-5). Still not equal. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the order is A, D, B, C. Let's check. Then vectors AD and BC. AD = D - A = (8-5,9-3)=(3,6). BC = C - B = (7-6,4-8)=(1,-4). Not equal. Hmm.

This is confusing. Maybe the issue is with the order of the points. Since the problem states the coordinates are (5,3), (6,8), (7,4), and (x,y), but doesn't specify the order. So perhaps the given points are in order, but we need to figure out the correct order to apply the vector approach.
</execution_4.1>

<execution_4.2>
Wait, but according to the formula, if D is B + C - A, which is (6 +7 -5, 8 +4 -3) = (8,9), then the midpoint of BD should be ((6 +8)/2, (8 +9)/2) = (7, 8.5). But midpoint of AC is (6, 3.5). These are different, which suggests that diagonals BD and AC do not bisect each other. Therefore, this is not a parallelogram? But that contradicts the earlier calculation.
</execution_4.2>

<execution_4.3>
Wait, maybe the diagonals are AB and CD. Midpoint of AB is ((5+6)/2, (3+8)/2) = (5.5, 5.5). Midpoint of CD is ((7+8)/2, (4+9)/2) = (7.5, 6.5). Not the same. Hmm, this is confusing.
</execution_4.3>

<execution_4.4>
Midpoint of AB: ((5+6)/2, (3+8)/2) = (11/2, 11/2) = (5.5, 5.5)

Midpoint of CD: ((7+8)/2, (4+9)/2) = (15/2, 13/2) = (7.5, 6.5)

These are different. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake here.

Wait, but according to the formula D = B + C - A, which is (6 +7 -5, 8 +4 -3) = (8,9). But if we consider diagonals AB and CD, their midpoints are different, which shouldn't be the case in a parallelogram. So, maybe this point is not part of the parallelogram? But according to the vector approach, if we have vectors AB and BC, then adding vectors appropriately should give the fourth point. Wait, I'm confused now.

Alternatively, maybe the sides are AB and AD. Let's compute.

-----

Based on execution_4.4:
Wait, perhaps the problem is that the given points are not in order. So, the order is not A, B, C, D. Therefore, the diagonals are not AB and CD, but perhaps AC and BD. Wait, but earlier when we took D as (8,9), the midpoints didn't match. Let's check again.

<execution_5.1>
If AB and AD are sides, then in a parallelogram, the fourth point D can be found by adding vectors AB and AC? Wait, not sure. Let me think.

Wait, actually, in a parallelogram, if you have two adjacent sides AB and AC, then the fourth vertex D is B + AC or C + AB. Wait, but in this case, AB is (1,5) and AC is (2,1). Then D would be B + AC = (6,8) + (2,1) = (8,9). Which is the same as D2. But earlier, when we tried this, the midpoints didn't match. Wait, but if the diagonals are AC and BD, then their midpoints must coincide. But according to this, midpoint of AC is (6, 3.5) and midpoint of BD is (7, 8.5). So they don't coincide, which suggests that this is not a parallelogram. But how?

Wait, maybe the order of the points is different. If we take the points as A, B, D, C, then the sides would be AB, BD, DC, and CA. Wait, but that doesn't form a simple quadrilateral. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the issue is that I assumed the wrong pairs as diagonals. Let me clarify.

If the fourth vertex is D(8,9), then the sides would be AB, BC, CD, DA. Wait, but if C is (7,4), then CD would be from (7,4) to (8,9), which is (1,5), same as AB. Then DA would be from (8,9) to A(5,3), which is (-3,-6). But BC is (1,-4). So DA is not equal to BC. So this is not a parallelogram. So something is wrong here.

Wait, so if we have points A(5,3), B(6,8), C(7,4), D(8,9), then AB is (1,5), BC is (1,-4), CD is (1,5), DA is (-3,-6). So opposite sides AB and CD are equal, but BC and DA are not equal. Therefore, it's not a parallelogram. So that's the problem. So D(8,9) is not a valid fourth vertex? But according to the formula D = B + C - A, which is a standard formula, but in this case, it's not forming a parallelogram. What's going on here?
</execution_5.1>

<execution_5.2>
If D is (8,9), then the diagonals would be AD and BC. Wait, let's check midpoints of AD and BC.

Midpoint of AD: ((5 +8)/2, (3 +9)/2) = (13/2, 12/2) = (6.5,6)

Midpoint of BC: ((6 +7)/2, (8 +4)/2) = (13/2,12/2) = (6.5,6). Ah! These midpoints are the same. Therefore, the diagonals AD and BC have the same midpoint. Therefore, in this case, the diagonals are AD and BC, which intersect at (6.5,6). Therefore, the sides would be AB, BC, CD, DA. Wait, but if the diagonals are AD and BC, then the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. But in this case, the sides AB and CD should be equal and parallel, and sides BC and DA should be equal and parallel.

Let's check vectors:

Vector AB = (1,5)

Vector CD = D - C = (8 -7,9 -4) = (1,5). So yes, AB = CD.

Vector BC = (1, -4)

Vector DA = A - D = (5 -8,3 -9) = (-3, -6). Wait, that's not equal to BC. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, vector DA should be equal to vector BC. Wait, vector DA is from D to A, which is A - D = (-3, -6). Vector BC is (1, -4). These are not equal. So that's an issue. So this suggests that even though the midpoints of the diagonals AD and BC coincide, the sides are not equal and parallel. Therefore, this can't be a parallelogram. Wait, but that contradicts the midpoint condition.

Wait, no. In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other, which is equivalent to the midpoints being the same. But if the midpoints are the same, then the figure is a parallelogram. So why are the sides not matching? Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the vector directions.

Wait, in a parallelogram, the opposite sides are equal and parallel, and the diagonals bisect each other. So if the midpoints of the diagonals are the same, then it's a parallelogram. So in this case, if diagonals AD and BC have the same midpoint, then it's a parallelogram. Therefore, sides AB and CD are equal and parallel, and sides AC and BD? Wait, no, sides AB and CD, BC and DA. Wait, maybe I messed up the sides.

Wait, let's clarify. If the diagonals are AD and BC, then the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. So sides AB and CD should be equal and parallel, and sides BC and DA should be equal and parallel. Let's check:

Vector AB = (1,5)

Vector CD = (1,5) as before.

Vector BC = (1, -4)

Vector DA = A - D = (5 -8, 3 -9) = (-3, -6). Which is not equal to BC. So that's a problem. So even though the midpoints of the diagonals are the same, the sides are not equal. Therefore, this is not a parallelogram? But according to the midpoint theorem, if the diagonals bisect each other, then it's a parallelogram.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the vector directions. Let's check again. If the diagonals are AD and BC, then in a parallelogram, the sides should be AB, BC, CD, DA. Wait, but if we consider the diagonals as AD and BC, then the sides would be AB, BD, DC, CA? No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the labeling is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA, and the diagonals are AC and BD. Wait, but if we take the diagonals as AD and BC, then the sides would be different. Maybe the confusion arises from how the points are connected.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that when we take diagonals AD and BC, the sides are not AB, BC, CD, DA, but instead AB, BD, DC, CA? No, that's not a standard way.

Wait, maybe the problem is that in this case, the diagonals are AD and BC, so the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. But in this configuration, the sides AB and CD are equal and parallel, but sides BC and DA are not. Therefore, this is not a parallelogram. Therefore, even though the midpoints of the diagonals are the same, the sides are not equal. Wait, that can't be. Because in a parallelogram, if the midpoints of the diagonals are the same, then it's a parallelogram. Therefore, my mistake must be in the calculation of the vectors.

Wait, let's recalculate vector DA. If the points are A(5,3), B(6,8), C(7,4), D(8,9). Then, the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA.

Vector AB: B - A = (1,5)

Vector BC: C - B = (1,-4)

Vector CD: D - C = (1,5)

Vector DA: A - D = (-3, -6)

So AB and CD are equal, which is good. But BC and DA are not equal. Therefore, this is not a parallelogram. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the approach.

But according to the midpoint formula, if the midpoints of the diagonals are the same, then it's a parallelogram. Therefore, my error must be in the identification of the diagonals. If the diagonals are AD and BC, then their midpoints are the same, but in reality, the sides are not equal. Therefore, that's a contradiction. Therefore, my understanding must be flawed.

Wait, no. Wait, in a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other, which is equivalent to having the same midpoint. Therefore, if the midpoints of the diagonals are the same, then the figure is a parallelogram. Therefore, in this case, even if the sides BC and DA are not equal, but the midpoints of the diagonals are the same, it's a parallelogram. But according to the vector calculation, the sides are not equal. Therefore, there must be a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm assuming the diagonals are AD and BC, but in reality, the order of the points is different. Let me think again. If the given points are A, B, C, D, then the diagonals are AC and BD. But if we compute midpoints of AC and BD, they are different. Therefore, that's not a parallelogram. However, if we take different pairs as diagonals, such as AD and BC, then their midpoints coincide, but that would require a different configuration.

Wait, maybe the given three points are not in the order of the parallelogram. So, the three points could be A, B, D, and the fourth point C. But the problem states the coordinates are (5,3), (6,8), (7,4), and (x,y). So the order is not specified. Therefore, the fourth point could be in different positions depending on which three points are considered as part of the parallelogram.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me refer back to the vector approach.

The three possible fourth vertices are (4,7), (8,9), and (6,-1). Of these, only (8,9) has x >7. Therefore, even if when we check the sides, it seems like it's not a parallelogram, but according to the midpoint formula, it should be. Wait, but maybe my vector calculation was wrong.

Wait, let's re-examine the vectors with D(8,9). If the diagonals are AD and BC, then:

Midpoint of AD: (6.5,6)

Midpoint of BC: (6.5,6)

Therefore, they coincide. Therefore, according to the midpoint condition, it's a parallelogram. But when we check the sides, BC is (1, -4) and DA is (-3, -6). These vectors are not equal. Therefore, this is a contradiction.

Wait, but in reality, in a parallelogram, the sides AB and CD are equal and parallel, and sides BC and DA are equal and parallel. So if AB is (1,5), then CD should be (1,5). Which they are. But BC is (1,-4), and DA is (-3,-6). These are not equal. Therefore, this is not a parallelogram. Therefore, this suggests that even though the midpoints of the diagonals coincide, the sides are not equal. Therefore, this is a problem.

Wait, but this can't be. Because in a parallelogram, the midpoints of the diagonals must coincide, and the sides must be equal and parallel. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's check the coordinates again. If A is (5,3), B is (6,8), C is (7,4), D is (8,9). Then:

AB vector: (1,5)

BC vector: (1,-4)

CD vector: (1,5)

DA vector: (-3,-6)

Wait, so AB and CD are equal, but BC and DA are not. Therefore, this is not a parallelogram. Therefore, there must be an error in the approach.

But according to the midpoint formula, if the midpoints of the diagonals are the same, then it's a parallelogram. Therefore, perhaps the problem is that the diagonals are not AD and BC, but another pair.

Wait, if diagonals are AC and BD, then midpoints are different. If diagonals are AB and CD, then midpoints are also different. Therefore, the only way for the midpoints to coincide is if diagonals are AD and BC. But in that case, the sides BC and DA are not equal. Therefore, this is a problem.

Wait, maybe the given points are not in order, so the sides are not AB, BC, CD, DA, but some other order. For example, if the points are A, B, D, C, then the sides would be AB, BD, DC, CA. But that's not a standard order.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the given three points are not consecutive vertices. For example, the three points could be A, B, D, and the fourth point C. But in that case, the midpoints would not necessarily coincide.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that there are multiple possible fourth points, and only one of them satisfies all the parallelogram conditions. Since D2 is (8,9), even though the sides don't seem to match, but according to the midpoint condition, it's a parallelogram. But the vector approach suggests that sides BC and DA are not equal. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. Therefore, perhaps the vector approach is more reliable.

Wait, but how? Let me check again.

If D is (8,9), then the sides would be AB, BC, CD, DA. But BC is (1,-4), DA is (-3,-6). These are not equal. Therefore, it's not a parallelogram. Therefore, this point is invalid. Then, why does the midpoint formula suggest it's a parallelogram?

Wait, no. The midpoint formula says that if the midpoints of the diagonals coincide, then it's a parallelogram. But in this case, the diagonals are AD and BC, which have the same midpoint. Therefore, according to the theorem, it should be a parallelogram. But the sides are not equal. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the understanding of which sides correspond to which vectors.

Wait, perhaps in this configuration, the sides are AB, BD, DC, and CA? No, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.

Wait, in a parallelogram, the sides are determined by the order of the vertices. If the vertices are A, B, D, C, then the sides are AB, BD, DC, and CA. But that would not form a closed figure. Wait, no. If the vertices are A, B, D, C, then connecting them in order would be A to B to D to C to A. But that would require that the sides are AB, BD, DC, and CA. But BD is from B to D, DC is from D to C, and CA is from C to A. That's a quadrilateral, but is it a parallelogram?

Wait, let's compute the vectors:

AB: (1,5)

BD: D - B = (8-6,9-8) = (2,1)

DC: C - D = (7-8,4-9) = (-1,-5)

CA: A - C = (5-7,3-4) = (-2,-1)

So sides AB and DC: AB is (1,5), DC is (-1,-5). These are negatives of each other, so they are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. Similarly, BD is (2,1), CA is (-2,-1). So opposite vectors. Therefore, the sides are equal in length but opposite in direction, which is consistent with a parallelogram. However, in terms of vectors, they are not the same, but they are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So, in terms of vectors, they are not equal, but in terms of sides, they are equal and parallel.

Wait, but in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel, so vectors should be the same. However, here, AB is (1,5), DC is (-1,-5). These are scalar multiples (negative of each other), so they are parallel but pointing in opposite directions. However, in terms of line segments, they are considered equal in length and parallel. So, depending on the context, sometimes vectors are considered up to direction, so the magnitude and direction (considering direction for parallelism). Wait, but in geometry, parallel vectors can be in the same or opposite direction. So, (1,5) and (-1,-5) are parallel because they are scalar multiples (scalar is -1). Therefore, they are parallel and equal in length. Therefore, in this case, sides AB and DC are parallel and equal in length, and sides BD and CA are parallel and equal in length. Therefore, this is a parallelogram.

Wait, but BD is from B to D, and CA is from C to A. So BD and CA are not sides of the parallelogram, but rather the diagonals? Wait, no. If the vertices are ordered A, B, D, C, then the sides are AB, BD, DC, and CA. But BD and CA are not sides but diagonals. Wait, this is getting confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the order of the points is different. If the points are ordered A, B, D, C, then the sides are AB, BD, DC, and CA. But BD and CA are not sides but diagonals. Therefore, perhaps the confusion is due to the order of the points.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to use the vector approach. If we have three points, we can find the fourth point such that the vectors satisfy the parallelogram conditions.

Given points A(5,3), B(6,8), C(7,4). Let's consider that the fourth point D must satisfy that vector AB equals vector DC, and vector BC equals vector AD.

Wait, vector AB is (1,5). So vector DC should be (1,5). Since C is (7,4), then D = C - vector DC = (7 -1, 4 -5) = (6, -1). But x=6 <7. Not acceptable.

Vector BC is (1,-4). So vector AD should be (1,-4). Since A is (5,3), D = A + vector AD = (5 +1, 3 -4) = (6, -1). Again, x=6 <7.

Alternatively, if we consider vector AD equals vector BC, and vector AB equals vector DC. Wait, same as before.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the given points are not in order, so the sides are not AB, BC, CD, DA, but another order. For example, if the points are A, C, B, D. Then, sides would be AC, CB, BD, DA. But this is getting too confusing.

Alternatively, let's use the general method for finding the fourth vertex given three vertices of a parallelogram.

The formula is: if three vertices are (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3), then the fourth vertex can be:

(x4,y4) = (x2 + x3 -x1, y2 + y3 - y1)

or

(x4,y4) = (x1 + x3 -x2, y1 + y3 - y2)

or

(x4,y4) = (x1 + y2 - y3, something). Wait, no.

Wait, the formula is that given three vertices, the fourth can be found by vector addition. If we consider two sides emanating from a common vertex, then the fourth point is the sum of the vectors.

Alternatively, the fourth vertex can be found by:

If the three points are A, B, C, then the fourth point D can be A + B - C, or B + C - A, or A + C - B.

So, as before, D1 = A + B - C = (4,7), D2 = B + C - A = (8,9), D3 = A + C - B = (6,-1). So these are the three possibilities.

Among these, only D2 has x >7, so x + y =17. Therefore, the answer is 17.

But earlier confusion was due to checking the sides, but according to the midpoint formula, if the midpoints of the diagonals coincide, then it's a parallelogram, regardless of the side vectors. Because in the case of D2, even though the vectors BC and DA are not equal, the vectors AB and CD are equal, and vectors BC and DA are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, which is still considered parallel. Therefore, in geometry, parallel vectors can be in opposite directions, so they are still considered parallel. Therefore, the figure is a parallelogram.

Therefore, the correct answer is x + y =17.
