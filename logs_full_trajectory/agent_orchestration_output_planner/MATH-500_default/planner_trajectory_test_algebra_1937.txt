Okay, let's see. I need to solve this equation: 441 plus 2 times 21 times 19 plus 361 equals x. Hmm. Alright, let's break it down step by step. First, I should remember the order of operations, right? Parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division, addition and subtraction. So here, there are no parentheses except around the numbers, which are just single digits or two-digit numbers. So, multiplication comes before addition.
The equation is 441 + [2*(21)*(19)] + 361 = x. So, I need to compute each part separately and then add them up.

Let me start with the multiplication part: 2 times 21 times 19. Let's do 2*21 first.

<prompt_1.1> Calculate the product of 2, 21, and 19 by first multiplying 2 and 21, then multiplying the result by 19. </prompt_1.1>

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to see this. Let me check if the equation can be expressed as a square of a binomial or something. Let's see: 441 is 21 squared, right?

<prompt_1.2> Explore if the equation can be expressed as a square of a binomial or another form, and verify if it leads to the same result. </prompt_1.2>

Wait, another thought. Maybe the problem is structured to recognize a pattern. Let's see: 21^2 + 2*21*19 + 19^2. If that's the case, then it would be (21 + 19)^2.

<prompt_1.3> Verify if the expression 21² + 2*21*19 + 19² can be recognized as a perfect square and confirm the result. </prompt_1.3>

2*21 is 42. Then, 42 times 19. Hmm, 42*19. Let me calculate that. 40*19 is 760, and 2*19 is 38, so 760 + 38 is 798. So, 2*21*19 is 798.
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
21*21 is 441. Then 19 squared is 361. So, the equation becomes 21² + 2*21*19 + 19². Hmm, that looks familiar. Isn't that the expansion of (a + b)²? Wait, no, the formula for (a + b)² is a² + 2ab + b². But here, we have a² + 2ab + b², which is exactly (a + b)². Wait, but in the original problem, it's 2ab, not 2ab. Wait, no, the middle term is 2*21*19, which is 2ab where a is 21 and b is 19. So, then, the entire expression is (21 + 19)². Let me check that.
</execution_1.2>

<execution_1.3>
Let's check: (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2. So if we have a^2 + 2ab + b^2, it's equal to (a + b)^2. In this problem, 21^2 + 2*21*19 + 19^2 would be (21 + 19)^2 = 40^2 = 1600. Which matches our previous result. So that's another way to see it. That might have been a quicker way, recognizing the expression as a perfect square. But since the problem was written as 441 + 2(21)(19) + 361, which are 21^2, 2*21*19, and 19^2, so that's exactly the expansion of (21 + 19)^2. Therefore, x = 40^2 = 1600.

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Now, adding all the parts together: 441 + 798 + 361. Let's add 441 and 798 first.

<prompt_2.1> Add 441 and 798, then add the result to 361 to find the value of x. </prompt_2.1>

Based on execution_1.2:
21 + 19 is 40. 40 squared is 1600. So that's another way to see that x is 1600. That's a smarter approach, using the algebraic identity. But either way, whether I compute each term separately or recognize the pattern, I get the same result.

Based on execution_1.3:
So, both methods confirm that x is 1600.

I think that's thorough.
I can't see any mistakes here. Let me just verify once more with the original computation:

<prompt_2.2> Perform a final verification of the solution using the original equation and confirm the result. </prompt_2.2>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
441 + 798. Let's see, 400 + 700 is 1100, and 41 + 98 is 139. So, 1100 + 139 is 1239. Then, adding 361 to 1239. 1239 + 361. Hmm, 1200 + 300 is 1500, and 39 + 61 is 100. So, 1500 + 100 is 1600. Wait, so 1239 + 361 equals 1600? Let me check again to make sure. 1239 + 361: adding the units place, 9 + 1 is 10, carryover 1. 3 + 6 is 9, plus 1 is 10, carryover 1. 2 + 3 is 5, plus 1 is 6. So, 1600.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
441 + 798 is 1239. Then 1239 + 361. 1239 + 300 is 1539, plus 61 is 1600. Yep. So, all methods lead to 1600.
</execution_2.2>
</Execution_2>

<Final_answer>
Therefore, the value of $x$ is $\boxed{1600}$.
