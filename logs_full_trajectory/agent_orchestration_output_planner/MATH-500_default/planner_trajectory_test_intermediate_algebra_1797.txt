Okay, so I need to find the distance between the foci of a hyperbola given its asymptotes and a point that the hyperbola passes through. Let me start by recalling some basic properties of hyperbolas and their asymptotes.

First, the standard form of a hyperbola depends on whether it's opening horizontally or vertically. The asymptotes can help me determine that. The given asymptotes are y = 2x - 3 and y = -2x + 17. Wait, the slopes are 2 and -2, which are reciprocals but with opposite signs. Hmm, actually, for hyperbolas, the slopes of the asymptotes are related to the coefficients in the standard equation.

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
If the hyperbola is centered at (h, k), then for a horizontally opening hyperbola, the asymptotes are y = ±(b/a)(x - h) + k, and for a vertically opening hyperbola, they are y = ±(a/b)(x - h) + k. The slopes are ±(b/a) or ±(a/b) depending on the orientation.

In this case, the slopes are ±2. So, if it's a horizontal hyperbola, then b/a = 2, meaning b = 2a. If it's vertical, then a/b = 2, meaning a = 2b. But I need to figure out which one is correct. Wait, maybe I can find the center first.

Based on execution_1.1:
To find the center of the hyperbola, I need to find the intersection point of the asymptotes. The asymptotes are y = 2x - 3 and y = -2x + 17. Let me solve these two equations simultaneously.

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Setting 2x - 3 = -2x + 17. Adding 2x to both sides: 4x - 3 = 17. Adding 3: 4x = 20. So x = 5. Then plugging back into y = 2x - 3: y = 10 - 3 = 7. So the center is at (5, 7).

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Wait, the hyperbola passes through the point (4,7). Let me check if this point is on the same horizontal or vertical line as the center. The center is (5,7), so (4,7) is one unit to the left.

But let me verify this. Let's check if the point (4,7) lies on this hyperbola.

<prompt_3.2> Verify that the point (4,7) lies on the derived hyperbola. </prompt_3.2>

Let me verify if that's possible.

But before that, maybe I should check if the hyperbola is horizontal or vertical. The slopes of the asymptotes are ±2. For a horizontal hyperbola, the slopes are ±(b/a). For a vertical hyperbola, they are ±(a/b). Since the slopes are 2 and -2, which are reciprocals if a = b, but wait, 2 is not the reciprocal of 2. Wait, reciprocal would be 1/2. So if the slopes are 2, then for a horizontal hyperbola, b/a = 2, so b = 2a.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
For a vertical hyperbola, the standard equation is ((y - k)^2)/a^2 - ((x - h)^2)/b^2 = 1. So plugging in (4,7):

(0)^2/a^2 - (1)^2/b^2 = 0 - 1/b^2 = -1/b^2. But this should equal 1. Wait, that's -1/b^2 = 1, which would mean b^2 is negative, which is impossible. That can't be right. So there's a mistake here.

Based on execution_3.1:
Alternatively, maybe I need to re-examine my assumption.

Wait, no. Let's think again.

Based on execution_3.2:
Wait, but if the center is (5,7), then the point (4,7) is (x - h) = -1, (y - k) = 0.

If the hyperbola is horizontal, then the asymptotes are y = ±(b/a)(x - h) + k. But in our case, the slopes are ±2, so (b/a) = 2. Therefore, b = 2a. However, if the hyperbola is vertical, the asymptotes are y = ±(a/b)(x - h) + k, so (a/b) = 2, meaning a = 2b. But given that the center is (5,7), and the hyperbola passes through (4,7), which is one unit left of the center. Let's see if that makes sense.

Wait, in a horizontal hyperbola, the vertices are along the horizontal axis, and the foci are also along the horizontal axis. In a vertical hyperbola, vertices and foci are along the vertical axis. The asymptotes' slopes depend on the ratio of b/a or a/b. But regardless, the slopes here are ±2. Let's see.

If the hyperbola is horizontal, then the equation is ((x - h)^2)/a^2 - ((y - k)^2)/b^2 = 1, with asymptotes y = ±(b/a)(x - h) + k. The slopes here would be ±(b/a). Since the slopes are ±2, then b/a = 2, so b = 2a. Then, the distance between the foci is 2c, where c^2 = a^2 + b^2. So c = sqrt(a^2 + (2a)^2) = sqrt(5a^2) = a*sqrt(5). Therefore, the distance between foci is 2a*sqrt(5).

If the hyperbola is vertical, the equation is ((y - k)^2)/a^2 - ((x - h)^2)/b^2 = 1, with asymptotes y = ±(a/b)(x - h) + k. The slopes here would be ±(a/b). Given the slopes are ±2, so a/b = 2, so a = 2b. Then, the distance between foci is 2c, where c^2 = a^2 + b^2. So c = sqrt((2b)^2 + b^2) = sqrt(5b^2) = b*sqrt(5). Therefore, distance between foci is 2b*sqrt(5).

<execution_4.2>
So plugging into the equation:

For vertical hyperbola: (0)^2/a^2 - (-1)^2/b^2 = -1/b^2 = 1. So -1/b^2 = 1 => b^2 = -1. Which is impossible. Therefore, the hyperbola cannot be vertical. Hence, my initial assumption must be wrong. So maybe the hyperbola is horizontal.

Let me check again. If the hyperbola is horizontal, then the standard equation is ((x - h)^2)/a^2 - ((y - k)^2)/b^2 = 1. Then, plugging in (4,7):

((4 - 5)^2)/a^2 - ((7 - 7)^2)/b^2 = (1)/a^2 - 0 = 1/a^2 = 1. Therefore, a^2 = 1, so a = 1. Then, since the slopes of the asymptotes for a horizontal hyperbola are ±(b/a) = ±b. Given that the slopes are ±2, then b = 2. Therefore, c^2 = a^2 + b^2 = 1 + 4 = 5, so c = sqrt(5). Then, the distance between the foci is 2c = 2*sqrt(5).

But wait, let me verify this.

But let me check if this makes sense. Let's write the equation of the hyperbola.
Center is (5,7). Since it's horizontal, the equation is ((x - 5)^2)/1^2 - ((y - 7)^2)/2^2 = 1.

Let's verify the asymptotes.

But let me check again.

<prompt_5.3> Re-confirm the orientation and calculations for the hyperbola. </prompt_5.3>
</Plan_5>

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
If the hyperbola is horizontal, center at (5,7), a = 1, b = 2. Then foci are located at (h ± c, k), where c = sqrt(a^2 + b^2) = sqrt(1 + 4) = sqrt(5). Therefore, the foci are at (5 ± sqrt(5), 7). The distance between them is 2*sqrt(5).
</execution_5.1>

<execution_5.2>
For a horizontal hyperbola, the asymptotes are y - k = ±(b/a)(x - h). So substituting the values: y - 7 = ±(2/1)(x - 5). Therefore, y = 2x - 10 + 7 => y = 2x - 3, and y = -2x + 10 + 7 => y = -2x + 17. Wait, but the given asymptotes are y = 2x - 3 and y = -2x + 17. So the positive slope is 2, and the negative slope is -2. So yes, that matches. Therefore, the hyperbola is horizontal, with a = 1, b = 2. Then, foci are located at (h ± c, k), where c = sqrt(a^2 + b^2) = sqrt(1 + 4) = sqrt(5). Therefore, the foci are at (5 ± sqrt(5), 7). Therefore, the distance between the foci is 2c = 2*sqrt(5).
</execution_5.2>

<execution_5.3>
If the hyperbola is horizontal, center (5,7), asymptotes are y = ±2(x - 5) + 7. Let's compute that.

For the positive slope: y = 2(x - 5) + 7 = 2x - 10 + 7 = 2x - 3. For the negative slope: y = -2(x - 5) + 7 = -2x + 10 + 7 = -2x + 17. Which matches the given asymptotes. Perfect.

So the hyperbola is horizontal, with a = 1, b = 2, c = sqrt(1 + 4) = sqrt(5). Therefore, the distance between the foci is 2c = 2*sqrt(5).
