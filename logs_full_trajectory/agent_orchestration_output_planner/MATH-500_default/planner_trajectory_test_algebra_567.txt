Okay, so I need to solve the equation |5x - 1| = x + 3 and find the largest value of x that satisfies it. Hmm, absolute value equations can sometimes have two solutions, right? Because the expression inside the absolute value can be either positive or negative. So, I should probably consider both cases. Let me start by recalling that if |A| = B, then A = B or A = -B, provided that B is non-negative. So, applying that here, the equation |5x - 1| = x + 3 would split into two separate equations:

1. 5x - 1 = x + 3
2. -(5x - 1) = x + 3, which simplifies to -5x + 1 = x + 3

But before solving each equation, I need to make sure that the right-hand side (x + 3) is non-negative because the absolute value on the left can't be negative.
So, x + 3 ≥ 0 ⇒ x ≥ -3. Therefore, any solution must satisfy x ≥ -3.

Let me tackle the first case: 5x - 1 = x + 3.

Now, moving to the second case: -5x + 1 = x + 3. Let's solve for x.

<prompt_1.2> Solve the second case of the equation where -5x + 1 = x + 3 and find the solution. </prompt_1.2>

Subtract x from both sides: 4x - 1 = 3. Then add 1 to both sides: 4x = 4. Divide by 4: x = 1.
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
Subtract x from both sides: -6x + 1 = 3. Then subtract 1: -6x = 2. Divide by -6: x = -2/6 = -1/3. Wait, is that right? Let me check the steps again.

Starting with -5x + 1 = x + 3. Let's add 5x to both sides: 1 = 6x + 3. Then subtract 3: -2 = 6x. So, x = -2/6 = -1/3. Yes, that's correct. So, the second solution is x = -1/3.

Based on execution_1.1:
Now, check if this solution satisfies the condition x ≥ -3.
Well, 1 is definitely greater than -3, so that's good. But I should also verify that this solution actually works in the original equation. Let's plug x = 1 into |5x - 1| and see if it equals x + 3.

<prompt_2.1> Verify that the solution x = 1 satisfies the original equation |5x - 1| = x + 3. </prompt_2.1>

Based on execution_1.2:
Check if x = -1/3 is ≥ -3.
Yes, -1/3 is approximately -0.333, which is greater than -3. Now, check in the original equation: |5*(-1/3) - 1| = |-5/3 - 1| = |-5/3 - 3/3| = |-8/3| = 8/3. On the right side, x + 3 = (-1/3) + 3 = (-1/3) + (9/3) = 8/3. So, that works too. So, both solutions are valid.

Based on execution_1.1, execution_1.2:
Therefore, the solutions are x = 1 and x = -1/3. The problem asks for the largest value of x, so between 1 and -1/3, the largest is 1.
Therefore, the answer is 1.

But wait, let me just make sure I didn't miss any other possible solutions or make any mistakes in my steps.

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
|5*1 - 1| = |5 - 1| = |4| = 4. And x + 3 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, 4 = 4. That checks out.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
Let me re-examine both cases.

First case: 5x - 1 = x + 3. Subtract x: 4x -1 = 3. Add 1: 4x = 4. x = 1. Checked in original equation, works. And x =1 is within the domain x ≥ -3.

Second case: -5x +1 = x +3. Add 5x: 1 = 6x +3. Subtract 3: -2 =6x. x= -2/6= -1/3. Checked in original equation, works. Also x= -1/3 is ≥ -3.

So both solutions are valid. Therefore, the largest x is 1.

<Final_answer>
Therefore, the largest value of $x$ that satisfies the equation $|5x-1|=x+3$ is $\boxed{1}$.
