Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how much 56 Drinkets are worth in Trinkets. The problem says that 1 Trinket is equal to 4 Blinkets, and 3 Blinkets equal 7 Drinkets. Hmm, so there's a chain here: Trinkets to Blinkets to Drinkets. I think I need to convert Drinkets to Blinkets first, and then Blinkets to Trinkets. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's handle the conversion from Drinkets to Blinkets. The problem states that 3 Blinkets are equal to 7 Drinkets. So, if 3 Blinkets = 7 Drinkets, then 1 Blinket would be equal to 7/3 Drinkets.
Wait, but we need to go the other way around. We have 56 Drinkets and want to know how many Blinkets that is. So, if 7 Drinkets = 3 Blinkets, then 1 Drinket = 3/7 Blinkets. Therefore, 56 Drinkets would be 56 multiplied by 3/7 Blinkets.

Let me calculate that.
56 divided by 7 is 8, and 8 multiplied by 3 is 24. So, 56 Drinkets equal 24 Blinkets.

Now, converting Blinkets to Trinkets. The problem says 1 Trinket = 4 Blinkets. So, 1 Blinket is 1/4 of a Trinket. Therefore, 24 Blinkets would be 24 multiplied by 1/4 Trinkets.
24 divided by 4 is 6. So, 24 Blinkets equal 6 Trinkets.

Therefore, 56 Drinkets equal 6 Trinkets.

Wait, let me double-check. Starting with 56 Drinkets, converting to Blinkets: 56 * (3 Blinkets / 7 Drinkets) = (56 * 3)/7 = (168)/7 = 24 Blinkets. Then converting 24 Blinkets to Trinkets: 24 * (1 Trinket / 4 Blinkets) = 24/4 = 6 Trinkets.

Alternatively, maybe using unit conversion factors. Let's see:

56 Drinkets * (3 Blinkets / 7 Drinkets) * (1 Trinket / 4 Blinkets) = 56 * 3/7 * 1/4 Trinkets. Let's compute that.

Another way: Maybe find how many Drinkets are in a Trinket. If 1 Trinket is 4 Blinkets, and 3 Blinkets are 7 Drinkets, then 4 Blinkets would be (4/3)*3 Blinkets, which is (4/3)*(7 Drinkets/3)? Wait, maybe that's complicating.

56 divided by 7 is 8, 8 times 3 is 24, 24 divided by 4 is 6. Yep, same result.

<Final_answer>
Therefore, the value of 56 Drinkets in Trinkets is $\boxed{6}$.
