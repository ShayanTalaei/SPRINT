</Question>

<Plan_1>
Okay, let's see. The problem is asking how many positive two-digit integers are factors of both 100 and 150. Hmm, so I need to find the common factors of 100 and 150 that are two-digit numbers. Alright, let me break this down step by step.

First, maybe I should find all the factors of 100 and all the factors of 150, then see which ones they have in common. But since we're only interested in two-digit factors, I can focus on that part. Alternatively, maybe a better approach is to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 100 and 150 first, and then find all the two-digit factors of that GCD. Because the common factors of 100 and 150 would be the factors of their GCD. That sounds efficient. Let me try that.

None

<prompt_1.1> Execute the plan to find the GCD of 100 and 150 and list all factors of the GCD. </prompt_1.1>

Let me see if there's another way to approach this. Maybe prime factorization? Let's try that.

<prompt_1.2> Use prime factorization to find the GCD of 100 and 150 and list all factors of the GCD. </prompt_1.2>

Alternatively, maybe listing factors without computing GCD. Let's see.

<prompt_1.3> List factors of 100 and 150 separately and find common two-digit factors. </prompt_1.3>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
So, first, find GCD(100, 150). To do that, I can use the prime factorization method. Let's see:

The prime factors of 100 are 2^2 * 5^2 (since 100 = 2*2*5*5).
The prime factors of 150 are 2 * 3 * 5^2 (since 150 = 2*3*5*5).

The GCD is the product of the smallest powers of the common primes. So, the common primes are 2 and 5. The smallest power for 2 is 1 (since 2^1 in both), and for 5 it's 2 (since 5^2 in both). Therefore, GCD(100, 150) = 2^1 * 5^2 = 2 * 25 = 50.
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
The prime factors of 100: 100 = 2^2 * 5^2. 

The prime factors of 150: 150 = 2 * 3 * 5^2. 

The GCD is the product of the smallest powers of the common primes. So, that would be 2^1 * 5^2 = 2*25=50. So GCD(100,150)=50. Then, the common factors of 100 and 150 are the factors of 50. 

Factors of 50 are 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50. Among these, the two-digit numbers are 10, 25, 50. So three numbers. So the answer is 3.
</execution_1.2>

<execution_1.3>
For 100: The factors are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100. Two-digit ones are 10, 20, 25, 50.

For 150: The factors are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 25, 30, 50, 75, 150. Two-digit ones are 10, 15, 25, 30, 50, 75.

Now, the intersection of these two sets is 10, 25, 50. So again, three numbers.

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.1:
Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. GCD of 100 and 150. 100 and 150.
Let's list the factors:

<prompt_2.1> Verify the calculation of the GCD by listing the factors of 100 and 150 and identifying common factors. </prompt_2.1>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
Factors of 100: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100.

Factors of 150: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 25, 30, 50, 75, 150.

The common factors are 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50. So yes, GCD is 50.

</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Now, the problem asks for two-digit integers. So from these common factors, which are two-digit numbers? Let's see:

<prompt_3.1> Identify the two-digit common factors of 100 and 150. </prompt_3.1>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
10, 25, 50. Wait, 10 is two-digit, yes (10 ≤ n ≤ 99). 25 is two-digit. 50 is two-digit. Are there any others? Let's check the common factors again. The common factors are 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50. So only 10, 25, 50. That's three numbers.
</execution_3.1>
</Execution_3>

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.1:
So the answer should be 3?

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any. Let me think again. Maybe I should list all factors of 100 and 150 and pick the common ones that are two-digit.

<prompt_4.1> Re-evaluate the solution by listing all factors of 100 and 150 and identifying the two-digit common factors. </prompt_4.1>

Alternatively, maybe I can approach this by finding the two-digit numbers that divide both 100 and 150. So, let's list two-digit numbers from 10 to 99 and check which divide both 100 and 150.

<prompt_4.2> List two-digit numbers and check which ones divide both 100 and 150. </prompt_4.2>

Wait, but maybe there's a more systematic way. Let me think. Since the GCD is 50, the common factors are the factors of 50.
So factors of 50 are 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50. So among these, the two-digit numbers are 10, 25, 50. So three numbers. So that's the answer.

Is there a possibility that I made a mistake in calculating the GCD? Let me check again.

<prompt_4.3> Re-check the GCD calculation using the prime factorization method. </prompt_4.3>

Alternatively, using the Euclidean algorithm. Let's try that.

<prompt_4.4> Use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of 100 and 150. </prompt_4.4>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
Factors of 100: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100.

Two-digit factors of 100: 10, 20, 25, 50.

Factors of 150: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 25, 30, 50, 75, 150.

Two-digit factors of 150: 10, 15, 25, 30, 50, 75.

Now, find the intersection of these two sets. The common two-digit factors are 10, 25, 50. So three numbers. Therefore, the answer is 3.
</execution_4.1>

<execution_4.2>
That might take a while, but maybe there's a smarter way. Let's see. Let's list the two-digit factors of 100 first.

100 divided by 10 is 10, so 10 is a factor. 100 divided by 20 is 5, so 20 is a factor. 100 divided by 25 is 4, so 25 is a factor. 100 divided by 50 is 2, so 50 is a factor. 10, 20, 25, 50. Those are the two-digit factors of 100.

Now, check which of these also divide 150.

Check 10: 150 divided by 10 is 15, which is an integer. So 10 is a common factor.

20: 150 divided by 20 is 7.5, which is not an integer. So 20 is not a common factor.

25: 150 divided by 25 is 6, which is an integer. So 25 is a common factor.

50: 150 divided by 50 is 3, which is an integer. So 50 is a common factor.

Therefore, the two-digit common factors are 10, 25, 50. That's three numbers.
</execution_4.2>

<execution_4.3>
The prime factors of 100: 2^2 * 5^2.

Prime factors of 150: 2 * 3 * 5^2.

So GCD is 2^1 * 5^2 = 2*25=50. Correct. So factors of 50 are 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50. So two-digit ones are 10, 25, 50. So three numbers.
</execution_4.3>

<execution_4.4>
GCD(150, 100). Divide 150 by 100, remainder is 50. Then GCD(100,50). Divide 100 by 50, remainder is 0. So GCD is 50.
</execution_4.4>
</Execution_4>

<Final_answer>
Therefore, there are $\boxed{3}$ positive two-digit integers that are factors of both 100 and 150.
