Okay, let's see. I need to find the value of \( x^3 - 2x + 1 \) given that \( x^2 - x - 1 = 0 \). Hmm, alright. So the equation \( x^2 - x - 1 = 0 \) is a quadratic equation. Maybe I can use this equation to simplify the expression \( x^3 - 2x + 1 \).

First, let me recall that if I have a quadratic equation, I can express higher powers of x in terms of lower powers using the original equation. Since \( x^2 = x + 1 \), perhaps I can use this substitution to reduce \( x^3 \) to something involving x and constants.

Let me try that.

So, \( x^3 \) is \( x \times x^2 \). But since \( x^2 = x + 1 \), substituting that in gives \( x^3 = x \times (x + 1) \).

Alternatively, maybe there's another method. For example, solving the quadratic equation for x and then substituting into the cubic expression. Let me try that approach to verify.

<execution_1.1>
Let me compute that: \( x \times x + x \times 1 = x^2 + x \). Wait, but \( x^2 \) is again \( x + 1 \), so substituting that in gives \( (x + 1) + x \). Simplifying that, \( x + 1 + x = 2x + 1 \). So, \( x^3 = 2x + 1 \).
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
The quadratic equation \( x^2 - x - 1 = 0 \) can be solved using the quadratic formula. The roots are:

\[ x = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 4}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2} \]

So the solutions are \( x = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \) and \( x = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \). These are the golden ratio and its conjugate.

Let me pick one of them, say \( x = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), and substitute into \( x^3 - 2x + 1 \). If the value is the same for both roots, then that would confirm the answer. Let's compute:

First, compute \( x^3 \). Since x is a root of \( x^2 = x + 1 \), we can use this to find higher powers. Wait, but we already did that earlier and found \( x^3 = x^2 + x \). Then substituting \( x^2 = x + 1 \) gives \( x^3 = (x + 1) + x = 2x + 1 \). Therefore, \( x^3 - 2x + 1 = (2x + 1) - 2x + 1 = 2 \). So even without calculating numerically, the algebraic manipulation shows it's 2. 

Alternatively, if I compute numerically with \( x = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \):

First, approximate \( \sqrt{5} \approx 2.236 \), so x ≈ (1 + 2.236)/2 ≈ 1.618.

Compute \( x^3 \): (1.618)^3 ≈ 1.618 * 1.618 * 1.618. First, 1.618 * 1.618 ≈ 2.618, then 2.618 * 1.618 ≈ 4.236.

Then, compute \( x^3 - 2x + 1 ≈ 4.236 - 2*1.618 + 1 ≈ 4.236 - 3.236 + 1 ≈ (4.236 - 3.236) + 1 ≈ 1 + 1 = 2 \). 

Similarly, for the other root \( x = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \approx \frac{1 - 2.236}{2} ≈ -0.618 \).

Compute \( x^3 \): (-0.618)^3 ≈ -0.618 * 0.618 * 0.618. Wait, actually, (-0.618)^3 = - (0.618)^3 ≈ -0.236. Then, \( x^3 - 2x + 1 ≈ -0.236 - 2*(-0.618) + 1 ≈ -0.236 + 1.236 + 1 ≈ ( -0.236 + 1.236 ) + 1 ≈ 1 + 1 = 2 \).

Based on execution_1.1:
Therefore, the expression \( x^3 - 2x + 1 \) becomes \( (2x + 1) - 2x + 1 \).

<prompt_2.1> Simplify the expression \( x^3 - 2x + 1 \) using the simplified \( x^3 \) as described in the above plan. </prompt_2.1>

Based on execution_1.2:
So both methods confirm that the value is 2. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 2.

Is there another way to approach this? Maybe polynomial division.

<prompt_2.2> Consider and apply polynomial division to find the remainder of \( x^3 - 2x + 1 \) divided by \( x^2 - x - 1 \) as described in the above plan. </prompt_2.2>

Let me simplify that: the 2x terms cancel out, and 1 + 1 = 2. So does that mean the value is 2? Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Starting with \( x^2 = x + 1 \). Then \( x^3 = x \times x^2 = x \times (x + 1) = x^2 + x \). Then substitute \( x^2 \) again: \( (x + 1) + x = 2x + 1 \). So \( x^3 = 2x + 1 \). Then substitute into the original expression: \( (2x + 1) - 2x + 1 = 2x + 1 - 2x + 1 = 2 \). The x terms cancel out, leaving 1 + 1 = 2.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
If we divide the polynomial \( x^3 - 2x + 1 \) by \( x^2 - x - 1 \), the remainder should be of degree less than 2, so let's say \( ax + b \). Then we can write:

\( x^3 - 2x + 1 = (x^2 - x - 1)(x + c) + ax + b \)

Let me expand the right-hand side:

\( (x^2 - x - 1)(x + c) = x^3 + cx^2 - x^2 - cx - x - c = x^3 + (c - 1)x^2 - (c + 1)x - c \)

Adding the remainder \( ax + b \):

Total RHS = \( x^3 + (c - 1)x^2 - (c + 1)x - c + ax + b = x^3 + (c - 1)x^2 + (-c - 1 + a)x + (-c + b) \)

Now, set this equal to the left-hand side \( x^3 - 2x + 1 \). Therefore, we can equate coefficients:

For \( x^3 \): 1 = 1, which is okay.

For \( x^2 \): Coefficient on RHS is \( c - 1 \), on LHS it's 0. Therefore, \( c - 1 = 0 \implies c = 1 \).

For \( x \): Coefficient on RHS is \( -c - 1 + a \), on LHS it's -2. Since c = 1, substitute:

\( -1 - 1 + a = -2 \implies -2 + a = -2 \implies a = 0 \).

For constant term: Coefficient on RHS is \( -c + b = -1 + b \), on LHS it's 1. Therefore:

\( -1 + b = 1 \implies b = 2 \).

Therefore, the remainder is \( 0x + 2 = 2 \). Hence, \( x^3 - 2x + 1 = (x^2 - x - 1)(x + 1) + 2 \). Therefore, when \( x^2 - x - 1 = 0 \), the expression \( x^3 - 2x + 1 \) simplifies to the remainder, which is 2. 

So this method also gives 2. That's consistent with the previous results.

Based on execution_2.1:
Wait, so is the answer 2? That seems straightforward, but let me verify using another method in case I missed something.

Alternative approach: Since \( x^2 = x + 1 \), maybe we can express \( x^3 \) in terms of x and constants, as I did before, but let me confirm again.

<prompt_3.1> Verify the result using the alternative approach as described in the above plan. </prompt_3.1>

<execution_3.1>
Calculating \( x^3 \):

\( x^3 = x \times x^2 \). But \( x^2 = x + 1 \), so substitute:

\( x^3 = x \times (x + 1) = x^2 + x \). Now, substitute \( x^2 \) again:

\( x^2 + x = (x + 1) + x = 2x + 1 \). Yes, that's correct. Then, substituting into the original expression:

\( x^3 - 2x + 1 = (2x + 1) - 2x + 1 = 2x + 1 - 2x + 1 = (2x - 2x) + (1 + 1) = 0 + 2 = 2 \). 

Therefore, the value is indeed 2.

Based on execution_3.1:
Alternatively, maybe I can use the original equation to find the value of x and then substitute into the expression. Let's see, solving \( x^2 - x - 1 = 0 \), the roots are \( x = [1 ± sqrt(1 + 4)]/2 = [1 ± sqrt(5)]/2 \).
So x is the golden ratio φ = (1 + sqrt(5))/2 or its conjugate ψ = (1 - sqrt(5))/2.

Let me compute \( x^3 - 2x + 1 \) for x = φ. Compute φ^3 first.

<prompt_4.1> Verify the result using the alternative approach by calculating \( x^3 - 2x + 1 \) for \( x = \phi \) as described in the above plan. </prompt_4.1>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
Since φ = (1 + sqrt(5))/2. Let's compute φ^2 first. φ^2 = [(1 + sqrt(5))/2]^2 = (1 + 2sqrt(5) + 5)/4 = (6 + 2sqrt(5))/4 = (3 + sqrt(5))/2. But from the equation x^2 = x + 1, φ^2 should equal φ + 1. Let's check: φ + 1 = (1 + sqrt(5))/2 + 1 = (1 + sqrt(5) + 2)/2 = (3 + sqrt(5))/2, which matches φ^2. Good.

Now, φ^3 = φ * φ^2 = φ*(φ + 1) = φ^2 + φ. Again, substitute φ^2 = φ + 1: φ^3 = (φ + 1) + φ = 2φ + 1. Therefore, φ^3 - 2φ + 1 = (2φ + 1) - 2φ + 1 = 2. Similarly, for the conjugate ψ = (1 - sqrt(5))/2, the same steps apply. ψ^2 = ψ + 1, so ψ^3 = 2ψ + 1, and ψ^3 - 2ψ + 1 = 2. 

Therefore, regardless of the root, the expression evaluates to 2.
