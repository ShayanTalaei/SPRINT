</Question>

<Plan_1>
Okay, so I need to convert the fraction 57 over 160 into a terminating decimal. Hmm, let me remember how to do this. I think a fraction will convert to a terminating decimal if the denominator, after simplifying the fraction, has no prime factors other than 2 or 5. Right?

So first, maybe I should check if 57 and 160 have any common factors. Let's see.

<prompt_1.1> Check if the numerator 57 and the denominator 160 have any common factors. </prompt_1.1>

Therefore, the fraction is already in its simplest form.

The numerator is 57, which is 3 times 19, if I recall correctly. And the denominator is 160. Let me factorize 160. 160 divided by 2 is 80, divided by 2 again is 40, again by 2 is 20, again by 2 is 10, and again by 2 is 5. So 160 is 2^5 times 5. So the prime factors of 160 are 2 and 5. 

Wait, and the numerator 57 is 3 times 19. So 57 and 160 don't have any common factors other than 1, right? So the fraction 57/160 is already in its simplest form.

Based on execution_1.1:
Therefore, to determine if it's a terminating decimal, I need to look at the denominator. Since the fraction is simplified, the denominator is 160, which factors into 2^5 * 5. 

Wait, the rule says that if the denominator has only 2s and 5s as prime factors, then the decimal terminates.
Since 160 is 2^5 * 5^1, which are both 2 and 5, that means the decimal should terminate.

So, how do I convert 57/160 into a decimal? Well, one way is to divide 57 by 160. Let me do that division step by step.

Alternatively, maybe I can adjust the denominator to make it a power of 10, since terminating decimals are related to powers of 10.

<prompt_2.1> Consider adjusting the denominator of 57/160 to make it a power of 10 and compare methods. </prompt_2.1>

Let me try the division method.

So 57 divided by 160. Let's write that as 57 รท 160.

Since 160 is larger than 57, the decimal will start with 0. So, we have 0. and then proceed with the division.

To perform the division, we can add a decimal point and zeros to 57, making it 57.000...

Alternatively, using the power of 10 method. Since the denominator is 2^5 *5, if we multiply numerator and denominator by 5^(4) to make the denominator 2^5 *5^5, which is (2*5)^5 = 10^5 = 100,000. Wait, let me check that.

<prompt_2.3> Use the power of 10 method to convert 57/160 into a decimal and verify the result. </prompt_2.3>

Since 160 is 2^5 * 5, if I can multiply both the numerator and denominator by 5^(3) to make the denominator 2^5 *5^4, which would be 10^5. Wait, let me check. 

Wait, 160 is 2^5 * 5^1. To convert the denominator to 10^n, which is 2^n * 5^n, we need to have the same number of 2s and 5s. Since there are 5 2s and 1 5, we need to multiply by 5^(4) to get 5^5, making the denominator 2^5 *5^5 = 10^5. So, multiplying numerator and denominator by 5^4 (which is 625) would give us a denominator of 10^5. Then the numerator becomes 57 * 625. Let me compute that.

So, 160 goes into 570 three times because 160*3 is 480. Subtract 480 from 570, we get 90. Bring down the next 0, making it 900. 160 goes into 900 five times (160*5=800). Subtract 800 from 900, we get 100. Bring down the next 0, making it 1000. 160 goes into 1000 six times (160*6=960). Subtract 960 from 1000, we get 40. Bring down the next 0, making it 400. 160 goes into 400 exactly two times (160*2=320). Wait, wait, 160*2 is 320? Wait, no, 160*2 is 320, but 160*2.5 would be 400. Wait, but we are dealing with whole numbers here. So 160*2=320, subtract that from 400, we get 80. Bring down the next 0, making it 800. 160 goes into 800 exactly 5 times. So 160*5=800, subtract that, we get 0. So the division is done here.

Putting it all together, the decimal is 0.35625.

The denominator is 2^5 *5^1. To make the denominator a power of 10, we need the same exponents for 2 and 5. So the higher exponent is 5 for 2. So we need to multiply by 5^(5-1) = 5^4. Wait, no. Let me think.

Wait, if the denominator is 2^5 *5^1, then to make it 10^n, we need to have both exponents equal. So the maximum exponent is 5. So we need to multiply numerator and denominator by 5^(5-1) = 5^4? Wait, no. Wait, denominator has 2^5 and 5^1. To make it 10^n, we need 2^n *5^n. So the current denominator has 2^5 and 5^1. So to make n equal to 5, we need to have 5^5. But the denominator already has 5^1, so we need to multiply by 5^(5-1) = 5^4. So denominator becomes 2^5 *5^1 *5^4 = 2^5 *5^5 = (2*5)^5 = 10^5. So yes, multiplying numerator and denominator by 5^4 (625) will convert the denominator to 10^5. 

So let's try that. 

Multiply numerator and denominator by 625:

Numerator: 57 * 625. Let's calculate that. 

57 * 600 = 34,200. 

57 * 25 = 1,425. 

So total numerator is 34,200 + 1,425 = 35,625. 

Denominator: 160 * 625 = 100,000. 

So the fraction becomes 35,625 / 100,000. 

Which is 0.35625.

But let me confirm once more. Let's do 57 รท 160.

<prompt_3.2> Confirm the result of converting 57/160 into a decimal using the power of 10 method. </prompt_3.2>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
First step: 57 divided by 160. 160 goes into 57 zero times. So we write 0. and then proceed. Then add a decimal point and zeros: 57.000000... 

160 into 570 (the first three digits after the decimal). 160*3=480, which is less than 570. 160*4=640, which is too much. So 3. Subtract 480 from 570: 90. Bring down the next 0: 900. 160*5=800. Subtract 800 from 900: 100. Bring down next 0: 1000. 160*6=960. Subtract 960 from 1000: 40. Bring down next 0: 400. 160*2=320. Subtract 320 from 400: 80. Bring down next 0: 800. 160*5=800. Subtract 800: 0. So the division gives 0.35625.

Alternatively, 160 is 1/625 of 100,000. Wait, no, 160*625=100,000. So 57*625=35,625. So 35,625 divided by 100,000 is 0.35625. 

Yes, that's correct.

So both methods give the same result. Therefore, 57/160 as a decimal is 0.35625, which is a terminating decimal.

Based on execution_3.2:
Let me just confirm once more with another approach. Let's convert the denominator to 10 by multiplying numerator and denominator by 5^4 as before.

<prompt_4.1> Confirm the result using another approach and ensure consistency across different methods. </prompt_4.1>

<execution_4.1>
Wait, but I already did that. So that gives 35,625/100,000, which is 0.35625. 

Alternatively, maybe simplify the multiplication. Let's see 57*625. Let's break down 625 as 500 + 125. So 57*500 = 28,500. 57*125. 125 is 100 + 25. So 57*100=5,700. 57*25=1,425. So 5,700 + 1,425 = 7,125. Then 28,500 + 7,125 = 35,625. Yep, that's right. 

So 35,625 divided by 100,000. Since 100,000 is 10^5, moving the decimal point five places to the left. 35,625 becomes 0.35625. 

Everything checks out.
