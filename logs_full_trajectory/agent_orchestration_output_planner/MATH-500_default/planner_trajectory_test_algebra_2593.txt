Okay, let's see. I need to find the value of (26² - 24² - 10)² - 10². Hmm, that looks like a combination of squares and subtraction. Maybe I can simplify it step by step. Let me break it down.

First, let's compute the inner part: 26 squared minus 24 squared minus 10. Then, take that result, square it, and subtract 10 squared. Alright, let's start with 26 squared.
26 times 26. Let me calculate that. 20 squared is 400, and 6 squared is 36, but then there's the cross term 2*20*6=240. So (20+6)² = 400 + 240 + 36 = 676. So 26² is 676.

Next, 24 squared.
24 times 24. Similarly, 20 squared is 400, 4 squared is 16, and the cross term is 2*20*4=160. So (20+4)² = 400 + 160 + 16 = 576. So 24² is 576.

Now subtract 24² from 26²: 676 - 576.
That's 100. Then subtract 10 more: 100 - 10 = 90. So the inner part simplifies to 90.

Now, take that result, which is 90, square it.
90 squared. Let me remember, 90 times 90. 9 times 9 is 81, and there are two zeros, so 8100. So (90)² = 8100.

Then subtract 10 squared from that.
10 squared is 100. So 8100 - 100 = 8000. Wait, so the final result is 8000?

But let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

But wait, maybe there's another way to approach this using algebraic identities to simplify the calculation? Let's see.

<execution_1.1>
First, 26 squared: 26*26. Let me compute it directly again. 26*20 is 520, and 26*6 is 156. Adding those together: 520 + 156 = 676. Correct. 

24 squared: 24*24. 20*24=480, 4*24=96. So 480 + 96 = 576. Correct. 

676 - 576 = 100. Then 100 -10=90. Squared is 90*90. 9*9=81, add four zeros? Wait, no. 90*90 is (9*10)*(9*10) = 81*100=8100. Correct. Then 8100 -100=8000.

<execution_1.2>
The expression is (26² - 24² - 10)² - 10². Hmm, the part inside the first square is 26² - 24² - 10. I know that a² - b² = (a - b)(a + b). Maybe I can apply that here to 26² - 24². Let's try:

26² - 24² = (26 - 24)(26 + 24) = (2)(50) = 100. Oh, that's the same result as before. Then subtract 10 gives 90. So squaring that gives 8100, subtract 100 gives 8000.

Based on execution_1.1:
Wait, but maybe I should check if there's a different way to compute this, just to be absolutely sure. Let's compute the inner part again: 26² -24² -10.

<prompt_2.1> Re-evaluate the inner part and the entire expression using a different order of operations to ensure consistency. </prompt_2.1>

Alternatively, maybe someone might miscalculate 26² as 676, 24² as 576, subtract them to get 100, then subtract 10 to get 90, square to get 8100, then subtract 100 to get 8000.

As we did before, that's 676 - 576 = 100, then 100 -10=90. Then 90 squared is 8100. Subtract 10 squared (100) gives 8000.

Therefore, the value of the given expression is $\boxed{8000}$.
