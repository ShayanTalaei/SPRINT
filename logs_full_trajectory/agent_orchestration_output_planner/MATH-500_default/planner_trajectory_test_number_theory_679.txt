<Question>
Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie walked around their neighborhoods selling girl scout cookies. Linda earned $\$27.47$, Sherry earned $\$35.23$, June earned $\$37.37$, and Connie earned $\$26.52$. After the sale, they pooled their money together and went to the bank to convert the coins into dollars. How much money, in cents, was left after they converted as many of the coins into bills as they could?
</Question>

<Plan_1>
Okay, let's see. So the problem is about Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie who sold girl scout cookies. They each earned different amounts, and then they combined their money. Then they went to the bank to convert as many coins into dollars as possible, and we need to find out how much money was left in cents after that.

First, I need to figure out the total amount they earned altogether. The question gives their earnings in dollars, but the answer needs to be in cents. Hmm, so maybe I should convert each of their earnings to cents first, sum them all up, and then see how much is left after converting as many cents into whole dollars as possible. The remaining cents would be the answer.

Let me start by converting each person's earnings from dollars to cents. I remember that $1 is equal to 100 cents. So, for each person, I can multiply their dollar amount by 100 to get cents. But wait, since the amounts given are to the cent, like $27.47, that already has the cents included. So, for example, Linda earned $27.47, which is 27 dollars and 47 cents.
So converting that entirely to cents would be 27 * 100 + 47 = 2747 cents.

Similarly, Sherry earned $35.23.
So that's 35 * 100 + 23 = 3523 cents.

June earned $37.37, which is 37 * 100 + 37 = 3737 cents.

Conny earned $26.52, which is 26 * 100 + 52 = 2652 cents.

So now, I need to add up all their cents. Let's compute the total cents:

<prompt_1.1> Calculate the total cents by adding Linda's, Sherry's, June's, and Connie's earnings in cents. </prompt_1.1>

But wait, the question is asking how much money was left after converting as many of the coins into bills as they could. So converting coins into bills would mean taking the total amount in cents and seeing how many dollars (which are 100 cents) can be made into bills, and the remainder would be the cents left.

<prompt_1.2> Determine the remaining cents after converting as many cents as possible into dollars from the total cents. </prompt_1.2>
</Plan_1>

<Execution_1>
<execution_1.1>
Linda: 2747 cents

Sherry: 3523 cents

June: 3737 cents

Connie: 2652 cents

Total cents = 2747 + 3523 + 3737 + 2652

Let me add them step by step.

First, add Linda and Sherry: 2747 + 3523

2747 + 3523: Let's break it down. 2000 + 3000 = 5000, 700 + 500 = 1200, 40 + 20 = 60, 7 + 3 = 10. So total would be 5000 + 1200 = 6200, 6200 + 60 = 6260, 6260 +10=6270. Wait, but 2747 + 3523: 2747 + 3500 is 6247, then add 23: 6247 +23=6270. Yes, that's correct. So Linda + Sherry = 6270 cents.

Next, add June's 3737 to that. 6270 + 3737.

6270 + 3000 = 9270, 9270 + 700 = 9970, 9970 + 37 = 9970 + 30 = 10000, 10000 +7=10007. Wait, let me check again. 6270 + 3737: 6000 + 3000 =9000, 200 +700=900, 70 +30=100, 0 +7=7. So 9000 +900=9900, 9900 +100=10,000, 10,000 +7=10,007. Yes, that's correct. So total now is 10,007 cents after adding June's.

Then add Connie's 2652: 10,007 + 2652.

10,000 + 2000 =12,000, 7 + 600=607, 52. Wait, maybe another way. 10,007 + 2000 =12,007, 12,007 + 600=12,607, 12,607 +52=12,659. Let me verify: 10,007 +2,652. Let's add 10,007 +2,000=12,007, then +652: 12,007 +600=12,607, +52=12,659. Yes, correct. So total cents is 12,659.

Wait, hold on. Let me check each addition again because it's easy to make a mistake here.

First, Linda: 2747, Sherry:3523. 2747 +3523. Let's do it digit by digit:



Then adding June's 3737: 6270 +3737. Let's do digit by digit:



Then adding Connie's 2652: 10,007 +2652. Digit by digit:
</execution_1.1>

<execution_1.2>
But first, let's compute the total cents they have. Let me add up each person's cents:

Linda: 2747 cents

Sherry: 3523 cents

June: 3737 cents

Conny: 2652 cents

Total = 2747 + 3523 + 3737 + 2652

Let me compute this step by step.

First, add Linda and Sherry: 2747 + 3523

2747 + 3523: Let's see, 2000 + 3000 = 5000, 700 + 500 = 1200, 40 + 20 = 60, 7 + 3 = 10. So total would be 5000 + 1200 = 6200, 6200 + 60 = 6260, 6260 +10=6270. Wait, but 2747 + 3523: 2747 + 3500 is 6247, then plus 23 is 6270. Yes, that's correct.

Then add June's 3737: 6270 + 3737

6270 + 3000 = 9270, 9270 + 700 = 9970, 9970 + 37 = 10007. Wait, 6270 + 3737: Let's break it down:

6270 + 3000 = 9270

9270 + 700 = 9970

9970 + 30 = 10000

10000 +7=10007. Yes, correct. So total now is 10,007 cents.

Then add Conny's 2652: 10007 + 2652

10007 + 2000 = 12007

12007 + 600 = 12607

12607 + 50 = 12657

12657 + 2 = 12659. Wait, let me check again:

10007 + 2652:

10007 + 2000 = 12007

12007 + 600 = 12607

12607 + 52 = 12659. Yes, that's right.

So the total cents they have is 12,659 cents.
</execution_1.2>
</Execution_1>

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.2:
Now, converting to dollars, since 1 dollar = 100 cents, so we can divide the total cents by 100 to get the number of dollars, and the remainder will be the cents left.

<prompt_2.1> Convert the total cents into dollars and determine the remaining cents after conversion. </prompt_2.1>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
So 12,659 divided by 100. 12,659 รท 100 = 126 dollars with a remainder of 59 cents. Because 126 * 100 = 12,600, and 12,659 - 12,600 = 59. So the remainder is 59 cents. Therefore, after converting as many coins into bills as possible, they have 59 cents left.
</execution_2.1>
</Execution_2>

<Plan_3>
Based on execution_2.1:
Wait, but let me double-check all steps to make sure there's no mistake.

First, converting each person's earnings to cents:

<prompt_3.1> Verify the conversion of each person's earnings from dollars to cents. </prompt_3.1>

Then total cents: 2747 + 3523 + 3737 + 2652.

<prompt_3.2> Verify the calculation of the total cents by adding each person's cents. </prompt_3.2>

Then converting total cents to dollars: 12659 cents รท 100 = 126 dollars and 59 cents.

<prompt_3.3> Verify the conversion of total cents into dollars and confirm the remaining cents. </prompt_3.3>
</Plan_3>

<Execution_3>
<execution_3.1>
Linda: $27.47 = 27*100 +47 = 2747 cents. Correct.

Sherry: $35.23 = 35*100 +23 = 3523. Correct.

June: $37.37 = 37*100 +37 = 3737. Correct.

Conny: $26.52 = 26*100 +52 = 2652. Correct.
</execution_3.1>

<execution_3.2>
Let me re-add them:

2747 + 3523: Let's compute 2000 + 3000 = 5000, 700 + 500 = 1200, 40 + 20 = 60, 7 + 3 = 10. So 5000 + 1200 = 6200, 6200 + 60 = 6260, 6260 + 10 = 6270. Correct.

6270 + 3737: 6000 + 3000 = 9000, 200 + 700 = 900, 70 + 30 = 100, 0 + 7 = 7. So 9000 + 900 = 9900, 9900 + 100 = 10,000, 10,000 +7=10,007. Correct.

10,007 + 2652: 10,000 + 2000 =12,000, 7 + 600=607, 52. Wait, maybe better to do 10,007 + 2000 =12,007, 12,007 + 600=12,607, 12,607 +52=12,659. Correct.

Total is 12,659 cents.
</execution_3.2>

<execution_3.3>
So 59 cents left. That seems correct.

But let me check each step again to be thorough.

First, converting each person's earnings:

Linda: $27.47. Since each dollar is 100 cents, so 27.47 * 100 = 2747 cents. That's correct.

Sherry: $35.23. 35.23 * 100 = 3523 cents. Correct.

June: $37.37. 37.37 * 100 = 3737 cents. Correct.

Conny: $26.52. 26.52 * 100 = 2652 cents. Correct.

Adding them up:

2747 + 3523. Let me compute this another way. 2747 + 3523: add the thousands, hundreds, tens, units.

2000 + 3000 = 5000

700 + 500 = 1200

40 + 20 = 60

7 + 3 = 10

So total is 5000 + 1200 = 6200, 6200 + 60 = 6260, 6260 +10=6270.
</execution_3.3>
</Execution_3>

<Plan_4>
Based on execution_3.3:
Then 6270 + 3737:

6000 + 3000 = 9000

200 + 700 = 900

70 + 30 = 100

0 +7=7

So 9000 +900=9900, 9900 +100=10,000, 10,000 +7=10,007.

Then 10,007 +2652:

10,000 +2000=12,000

7 +600=607

52. Wait, maybe breaking it down as:

10,007 +2000=12,007

12,007 +600=12,607

12,607 +52=12,659.

Yes, that's 12,659. Then 12,659 divided by 100 is 126.59, which is 126 dollars and 59 cents. So the remainder is 59 cents. Therefore, the answer is 59 cents.

Wait, but the problem says "how much money, in cents, was left after they converted as many of the coins into bills as they could"? So the remainder after converting to dollars is the answer. Since 12,659 cents divided by 100 is 126 dollars and 59 cents, so 59 cents left. So the answer is 59.

But let me confirm once again. Maybe there's an error in the addition. Let's add all four amounts step by step in another way.

First, add Linda and June: 2747 + 3737.

<prompt_4.1> Re-add the amounts using a different method to confirm the total cents. </prompt_4.1>

Then Sherry and Conny: 3523 +2652.

<prompt_4.2> Continue re-adding the amounts to confirm the total cents. </prompt_4.2>
</Plan_4>

<Execution_4>
<execution_4.1>
2000 +3000=5000, 700 +700=1400, 40 +30=70, 7 +7=14. So 5000 +1400=6400, 6400 +70=6470, 6470 +14=6484. So Linda + June =6484.

Then Sherry + Conny:3523 +2652.

3000 +2000=5000, 500 +600=1100, 20 +50=70, 3 +2=5. So 5000 +1100=6100, 6100 +70=6170, 6170 +5=6175.

Then total is 6484 +6175. Let's compute that: 6000 +6000=12,000, 400 +175=575. So 12,000 +575=12,575. Wait, but that contradicts the previous total of 12,659. Wait, something's wrong here. There must be a mistake here.
</execution_4.1>

<execution_4.2>
Then add both results.

So Linda + June: 2747 +3737. 2000 +3000=5000, 700+700=1400, 40+37=77, 7+0=7. So 5000 +1400=6400, 6400 +77=6477, 6477 +7=6484.

Sherry + Conny: 3523 +2652. 3000 +2000=5000, 500 +600=1100, 20 +50=70, 3 +2=5. So 5000 +1100=6100, 6100 +70=6170, 6170 +5=6175.

Now add 6484 +6175. 6000 +6000=12000, 400 +175=575. So 12000 +575=12575. Wait, that's different from before. Wait, this can't be. There must be a mistake here. Wait, 6484 +6175.

Let me compute 6484 +6175:

6484 +6000=12484

12484 +175=12659. Ah, right. So total is 12,659. So same as before. Okay, so that's correct. So the total is 12,659 cents. So dividing by 100 gives 126*100=12,600, remainder 59. So 59 cents left.

Therefore, the answer is 59 cents, which is 59. So in the box, \boxed{59}.

<Plan_5>
Based on execution_4.1, execution_4.2:
But wait, let me check once again. Let's compute 2747 +3523 +3737 +2652.

<prompt_5.1> Verify the total cents once again to ensure accuracy. </prompt_5.1>
</Plan_5>

<Execution_5>
<execution_5.1>
Let's compute step by step:

Start with 2747.

Add 3523: 2747 +3523 = 2747 +3500 +23 = 6247 +23 = 6270.

Add 3737: 6270 +3737. 6270 +3000 =9270, 9270 +700=9970, 9970 +37=10007.

Add 2652: 10007 +2652. 10007 +2000=12007, 12007 +600=12607, 12607 +52=12659. Yes, correct. So total is 12,659 cents.

Divide by 100: 12,659 รท100=126*100=12,600. 12,659 -12,600=59. So remainder is 59 cents. Therefore, the answer is 59.
</execution_5.1>
</Execution_5>

<Plan_6>
Based on execution_5.1:
Wait, but let me check once more for any possible miscalculations. For example, maybe a wrong addition when adding the original amounts. Let me try adding all four numbers together again:

<prompt_6.1> Re-verify the addition of all four numbers to ensure the total is correct. </prompt_6.1>

10007

+2652

=10007+2652=12659. Yes, correct.

So all steps check out. Therefore, the remaining cents after converting as many as possible into dollars (i.e., 126 dollars) is 59 cents. So the answer is 59.
</execution_6.1>

<Final_answer>
Therefore, the amount of money, in cents, left after they converted as many of the coins into bills as they could is $\boxed{59}$ cents.
