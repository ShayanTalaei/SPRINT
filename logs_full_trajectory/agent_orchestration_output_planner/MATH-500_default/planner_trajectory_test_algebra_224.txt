<Plan_1>
Okay, let's see. The problem says that the square root of t is greater than 2 and less than 3.5. I need to find how many integer values of t satisfy this condition. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, translating the inequality into something more familiar. If the square root of t is between 2 and 3.5, then if I square all parts of the inequality, that should give me the range for t. Since squaring is a monotonic function for non-negative numbers, the direction of the inequalities won't change. So, starting with the original inequality:

2 < √t < 3.5

Squaring all parts should give:
2² < t < 3.5²

Which is 4 < t < 12.25.

Wait, but t has to be an integer. So t must be an integer greater than 4 and less than 12.25.
Therefore, the integer values t can take are 5, 6, 7, ...., up to 12, right? Because 12.25 is not an integer, so the largest integer less than 12.25 is 12.

Now, let's list the integers from 5 to 12 inclusive. Let me count them: 5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12.

<prompt_1.1> Count the integer values from 5 to 12 inclusive. </prompt_1.1>

Wait, but let me check if 12 is included.
The original inequality is √t < 3.5. Let's compute 3.5 squared: 3.5*3.5 = 12.25. So t must be less than 12.25. Therefore, t can be up to 12, since 12 is less than 12.25, but 13 would be 13 >12.25, which is not allowed.

So 5 through 12 inclusive.
That's 8 numbers. So the answer is 8.

Wait, but let me verify again. Let's take each integer from 5 to 12 and check if their square roots are between 2 and 3.5.

<prompt_1.2> Verify each integer from 5 to 12 by checking if their square roots are between 2 and 3.5. </prompt_1.2>

Is there any integer between 5 and 12? For example, 5,6,7,...,12. Yes, all consecutive integers.

But wait, let me think again. The problem says "the square root of t is greater than 2 and less than 3.5".

<prompt_1.3> Re-evaluate the problem statement and confirm the solution. </prompt_1.3>

But wait, just to be thorough, let me check each number:

<prompt_1.4> Perform a final verification of each integer from 5 to 12. </prompt_1.4>

But let me check if there's another way to compute the number of integers between two numbers. The formula is: the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a +1. Here, a=5, b=12.

<prompt_1.5> Use the formula to calculate the number of integers from 5 to 12 and confirm the result. </prompt_1.5>

<execution_1.1>
That's 8 numbers. Let me count again: starting at 5, each subsequent number is 6,7,8,9,10,11,12. Yep, 8 numbers.

<execution_1.2>
√5 ≈ 2.236, which is greater than 2 and less than 3.5. Okay.

√6 ≈ 2.449, same reasoning.

√7 ≈ 2.645

√8 ≈ 2.828

√9 = 3, which is still less than 3.5.

√10 ≈ 3.162

√11 ≈ 3.316

√12 ≈ 3.464, which is still less than 3.5. So 12 is included.

If we check 13, √13 ≈ 3.605, which is greater than 3.5, so 13 is excluded. So yes, the integers are 5 through 12 inclusive.
</execution_1.2>

<execution_1.3>
So, strictly greater than 2, strictly less than 3.5. So √t >2 implies t>4, and √t <3.5 implies t<12.25. So t must be an integer in (4,12.25). So integers 5 through 12 inclusive. So 12-5 +1=8.
</execution_1.3>

<execution_1.4>
√5 ≈ 2.236, which is greater than 2 and less than 3.5. Good.

√6 ≈ 2.449, same reasoning.

√7 ≈ 2.645, √8 ≈ 2.828, √9 = 3, √10 ≈ 3.162, √11 ≈ 3.316, √12 ≈ 3.464. All of these are between 2 and 3.5. So yes, each of these integers t from 5 to 12 inclusive satisfy the condition.

So that's 12 -5 +1 = 8 numbers.
</execution_1.4>

<execution_1.5>
So 12 -5 +1=8. So that's 8 numbers. So that's correct.

Wait a second, but maybe I made a mistake in the initial step. Let me confirm the squaring step again.

Original inequality: 2 < √t < 3.5. Squaring all parts: 4 < t < 12.25. Since t must be an integer, t can be 5,6,....,12. So yes, 8 numbers.

<Plan_2>
Based on execution_1.2:
Therefore, the number of integer values is 12 -5 +1 =8.

But wait, hold on. Let me check if the endpoints are included correctly.

<prompt_2.1> Re-evaluate the inclusion of endpoints 5 and 12 in the range of integers. </prompt_2.1>

Based on execution_1.5:
Therefore, the answer is 8. I think that's solid.
The answer is \boxed{8}.

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
The original inequality is strictly greater than 2 and strictly less than 3.5. So √t must be greater than 2, so t must be greater than 4. Since t is an integer, the smallest t is 5. Similarly, √t must be less than 3.5, so t must be less than 12.25, so the largest integer t is 12.
</execution_2.1>
</Execution_2>

<Final_answer>
Therefore, there are $\boxed{8}$ integer values of $t$ that satisfy the given condition.
