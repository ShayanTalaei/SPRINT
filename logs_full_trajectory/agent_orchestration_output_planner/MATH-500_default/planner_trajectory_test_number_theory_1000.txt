<Question>
Compute $17^{-1}\pmod{83}$. Express your answer as a residue from $0$ to $82$, inclusive.

(You may find it helpful to consider the fact that $17\cdot 5=85$.)

Okay, so I need to find the inverse of 17 modulo 83. Hmm, let me remember. The inverse of a number a modulo m is a number x such that (a * x) ≡ 1 mod m. So, in this case, I need to find an integer x where 17 * x is congruent to 1 modulo 83. That means when I multiply 17 by x and divide by 83, the remainder should be 1.

One method to find modular inverses is the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. I think that's the way to go here. Let me recall how that works. The Extended Euclidean Algorithm not only finds the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers but also finds integers x and y such that ax + by = gcd(a, b). Since 17 and 83 are coprime (because 83 is a prime number and 17 is less than 83 and not a multiple of 83), their gcd should be 1. Therefore, there should be integers x and y such that 17x + 83y = 1. The x here would be the inverse of 17 modulo 83.

Alright, let's try to apply the Extended Euclidean Algorithm step by step.

First, we divide the larger number by the smaller one.

But let me make sure. Let's check 17*5=85. Since 85 is 2 mod83 (because 85-83=2), so 17*5=2 mod83. Then, if I need 17*x ≡1 mod83, perhaps I can use this.

So, 83 divided by 17. Let's compute that.

17 * 4 = 68. 83 - 68 = 15. So, 83 = 17 * 4 + 15. The quotient is 4 and the remainder is 15.

<execution_1.2>
If 17*5=2 mod83, then maybe multiplying both sides by the inverse of 2 mod83? But I need to find the inverse of 2 mod83. Let's see, 2*42=84, which is 1 mod83. So inverse of 2 is 42. Therefore, if I take 17*5*42 ≡2*42≡84≡1 mod83. So 17*(5*42)≡1 mod83. Therefore, x=5*42=210. Then 210 mod83. Let's compute 83*2=166, 210-166=44. So 210≡44 mod83. Wait, but earlier we found x=44. So that's the same result. So that checks out.

Alternatively, maybe there's a faster way. But in any case, both methods lead to x=44. So that's consistent.

Based on execution_1.1:
Next, take 17 and divide by the remainder 15.

<prompt_2.1> Execute the next step of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm with 17 and 15. </prompt_2.1>

Based on execution_1.2:
Another way to check is to multiply 17 and 44 directly and see the remainder when divided by 83.

<prompt_2.2> Perform a final verification by direct multiplication of 17 and 44 and check the remainder. </prompt_2.2>
</Plan_2>

<Execution_2>
<execution_2.1>
15 * 1 = 15. 17 - 15 = 2. So, 17 = 15 * 1 + 2. The quotient is 1 and the remainder is 2.
</execution_2.1>

<execution_2.2>
17*44: Let's compute 17*40=680 and 17*4=68. So 680 + 68 = 748. Now, divide 748 by 83. Let's see, 83*9=747. So 748 - 747 = 1. So 748 divided by 83 is 9 with a remainder of 1. Therefore, 17*44=748≡1 mod83.

Based on execution_2.1:
Now, take 15 and divide by the remainder 2.

<prompt_3.1> Execute the step of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm with 15 and 2, and summarize the process. </prompt_3.1>

Based on execution_2.2:
Wait, that was easier than I expected once I saw the hint. Maybe that's a more straightforward method if I can spot that 17*5 is just above 83. But in any case, both the Extended Euclidean Algorithm and that shortcut lead to the same answer.
I think either way, the answer is 44.

Let me just do a final verification. 17*44: 17*40=680, 17*4=68, so 680+68=748. 83*9=747, so 748-747=1. Yep, remainder 1. Perfect.

**Final Answer**
The inverse of 17 modulo 83 is \boxed{44}.

15 divided by 2 is 7*2=14, remainder 1. So, 15 = 2 * 7 + 1. The quotient is 7 and the remainder is 1.

Now, take 2 and divide by the remainder 1. That gives a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 0. Since we've reached a remainder of 0, the last non-zero remainder is 1, which confirms that the gcd is 1, as expected.
