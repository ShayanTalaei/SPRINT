Okay, let's see. The problem is asking for the integer value of x in the arithmetic sequence 3², x, 3⁴. Hmm, arithmetic sequence, right? So, in an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. That means the difference between the first and second term should be the same as the difference between the second and third term. So, if I can figure out that common difference, I can find x.

First, let me compute the values of 3² and 3⁴ to get actual numbers.
3² is 9, and 3⁴ is 81. So the sequence is 9, x, 81.

Since it's an arithmetic sequence, the difference between each term should be the same. Let me denote the common difference as d. Then, the second term (x) would be the first term plus d, and the third term would be the second term plus d. So, x = 9 + d, and 81 = x + d. 

If I substitute the first equation into the second, I get 81 = (9 + d) + d.
Simplifying that, 81 = 9 + 2d. Subtract 9 from both sides: 72 = 2d. Then divide both sides by 2: d = 36.

So the common difference is 36. Therefore, x is 9 + 36, which is 45.

Wait, let me check that again.
If x is 45, then the next term should be 45 + 36 = 81, which matches the given third term. So that works.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is that in an arithmetic sequence, the middle term is the average of the first and third terms. So x should be (9 + 81)/2.
Let me compute that: 90 divided by 2 is 45. Yep, that's another way to confirm. So x is definitely 45.

But wait, let me make sure there's no trick here. The problem mentions that x is an integer.
Since 45 is an integer, that fits. If there was a fractional common difference, x might not be an integer, but in this case, both 9 and 81 are integers, and the difference needed is 36, which when added to 9 gives another integer.

Another check: Let's list the terms. First term is 9, second term is 45, third term is 81. The difference between 9 and 45 is 36, and between 45 and 81 is also 36.
So the sequence is 9, 45, 81, which is indeed an arithmetic sequence with common difference 36.

I don't think I missed anything here. The key was recognizing that in an arithmetic sequence, the middle term is the average of the first and third terms, or equivalently, the common difference can be found by subtracting the first term from the third term and dividing by 2.
Since (81 - 9)/2 = 72/2 = 36, which gives the common difference, and adding that to the first term gives x. All steps lead to x = 45, which is an integer, so it satisfies the problem's condition.
