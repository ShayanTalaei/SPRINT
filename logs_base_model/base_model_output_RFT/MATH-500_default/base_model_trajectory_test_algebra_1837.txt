Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what the question is asking. 

So, Denali and Nate are dog walkers. Denali currently walks 16 dogs, and Nate walks 12. The company is changing their assignments, but the ratio of their pay should stay the same in two different scenarios. The first scenario is if Denali starts walking 4x more dogs while Nate stays at 12. The second scenario is if x of Nate's dogs are reassigned to Denali. We need to find x, where x isn't zero.

Hmm, let me break this down. The key here is that the ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay remains the same in both situations. Since the pay is based on the number of dogs each walks, the ratio of their pay will be the same as the ratio of the number of dogs they walk. So, if we can set up equations for both scenarios and set their ratios equal, we can solve for x.

Let me assign variables. Let's say the pay per dog is the same for both Denali and Nate, so the total pay is just the number of dogs times the pay per dog. Therefore, the ratio of their pay is equal to the ratio of the number of dogs they walk. So, the problem reduces to finding x such that:

Ratio in first scenario = Ratio in second scenario.

First, let's write the pay ratio in the original setup. Denali has 16 dogs, Nate has 12. So the ratio is 16:12, which simplifies to 4:3. So, 16/12 = 4/3.

But in both scenarios, the ratio should remain the same. Let's handle the first scenario: Denali walks 4x more dogs. So her new number of dogs is 16 + 4x. Nate stays at 12. So the ratio here is (16 + 4x)/12. We need this to equal 4/3.

Alternatively, the second scenario is that x of Nate's dogs are reassigned to Denali. So Denali's new number is 16 + x, and Nate's new number is 12 - x. The ratio here is (16 + x)/(12 - x). This should also equal 4/3.

Wait, but the problem states that the ratio would be the same in both scenarios. So both (16 + 4x)/12 and (16 + x)/(12 - x) must equal 4/3. But that can't be right unless both equations are true. Wait, maybe I misread the problem.

Wait, let me check again. The problem says: "The ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay would be the same if Denali started walking 4x more dogs and Nate stayed at 12 dogs or if x of Nate's dogs were reassigned to Denali."

So, the ratio is the same in either of those two scenarios. Therefore, the ratio from the first scenario must equal the ratio from the second scenario. So:

(16 + 4x)/12 = (16 + x)/(12 - x)

Ah, that makes sense. So the two different operations (adding 4x to Denali or moving x from Nate to Denali) lead to the same ratio. Therefore, setting those two ratios equal will give us an equation to solve for x.

So, first, let's write that equation:

(16 + 4x)/12 = (16 + x)/(12 - x)

Now, cross-multiplying to solve for x:

(16 + 4x)(12 - x) = 12(16 + x)

Let me compute the left side first:

16*(12 - x) + 4x*(12 - x) = 192 - 16x + 48x - 4x² = 192 + 32x - 4x²

Right side:

12*(16 + x) = 192 + 12x

So setting left side equal to right side:

192 + 32x - 4x² = 192 + 12x

Subtract 192 from both sides:

32x - 4x² = 12x

Subtract 12x from both sides:

20x - 4x² = 0

Factor out 4x:

4x(5 - x) = 0

So, 4x = 0 => x = 0, but the problem states x ≠ 0.

Or 5 - x = 0 => x = 5

Therefore, x = 5.

Wait, let me check if this works. Let's plug x = 5 into both ratios.

First scenario: Denali walks 16 + 4*5 = 16 + 20 = 36 dogs. Nate stays at 12. Ratio is 36/12 = 3.

Second scenario: Denali walks 16 + 5 = 21 dogs. Nate has 12 - 5 = 7 dogs. Ratio is 21/7 = 3. So both ratios are 3, which is equal to 4/3? Wait, 3 is 3/1, but originally the ratio was 16/12 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333. Wait, that's not matching.

Wait, hold on. Wait, the original ratio was 16/12 = 4/3. But in both scenarios, the ratio becomes 3. That's different. Wait, that can't be. So if x=5, then the ratio becomes 3 in both cases, but the original ratio was 4/3. So that contradicts the problem statement, which says the ratio would be the same in both scenarios. Wait, but according to the problem, the ratio should be the same, but not necessarily the same as the original ratio.

Wait, let me re-read the problem statement: "The ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay would be the same if Denali started walking 4x more dogs and Nate stayed at 12 dogs or if x of Nate's dogs were reassigned to Denali."

So, the ratio in both cases is the same, but it doesn't have to be the original ratio. It just has to be the same ratio in both scenarios. So, in the first scenario, the new ratio is 36/12 = 3. In the second scenario, 21/7 = 3. So both are 3, which is the same. Therefore, x=5 is correct. But the original ratio was 4/3, which is different. So the problem is saying that after these changes, the ratio becomes the same in both cases, but not necessarily the original ratio. So, the answer is x=5.

But wait, let me check again. Let me verify the equations step by step.

Original ratio: 16/12 = 4/3.

First scenario: (16 + 4x)/12 = ?

Second scenario: (16 + x)/(12 - x) = ?

We are told that these two ratios are equal. So, (16 + 4x)/12 = (16 + x)/(12 - x). Solving this gives x=5. Then, substituting back, both ratios equal 3. So, the ratio is 3, which is different from the original 4/3. But the problem says the ratio would be the same in both scenarios, which is 3. So, that's correct.

Therefore, the answer is x=5.

Wait, but let me check if there's another solution. When we solved the equation, we got x=5 and x=0. Since x≠0, the answer is x=5.

Therefore, the value of x is 5.
