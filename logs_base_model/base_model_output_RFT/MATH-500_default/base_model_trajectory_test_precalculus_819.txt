Okay, so I need to figure out what shape the equation z = c represents in cylindrical coordinates. Hmm, let me start by recalling what cylindrical coordinates are. In cylindrical coordinates, a point in space is represented by (r, θ, z), where r is the radial distance from the z-axis, θ is the angular coordinate around the z-axis, and z is the height above the xy-plane. 

The equation given is z = c. That means for any point on this shape, the z-coordinate is constant, right? So regardless of the values of r and θ, the height z doesn't change. Let me think about what this implies. If z is fixed at c, then all points on this shape lie at a constant height above the xy-plane. 

Wait, in Cartesian coordinates, if z is constant, then the equation z = c represents a plane parallel to the xy-plane. But here, the question is in cylindrical coordinates. So, even though the coordinates are different, the geometric interpretation might still be similar. 

Let me visualize this. In cylindrical coordinates, moving along the z-axis changes the height, while moving in the r or θ directions changes the radial distance and the angle. So if z is fixed, then all points with that z-coordinate form a surface where you can vary r and θ freely. But since r and θ are independent of z here, the shape should be a plane. 

Wait, but in the options, there's a plane (option C). But hold on, maybe I should confirm. Let's think about the difference between cylindrical and Cartesian coordinates. In Cartesian, z = c is a plane, but in cylindrical, does the equation z = c also represent a plane? Because in cylindrical coordinates, z is just the vertical coordinate, same as in Cartesian. So if you fix z, you're fixing the height, which is exactly what a plane parallel to the xy-plane does. 

But wait, the options include a cylinder as well. Could it be a cylinder? A cylinder in cylindrical coordinates is usually represented by equations like r = constant, right? Because r is the radial distance. If r = constant, then that's a cylinder around the z-axis. But here, the equation is z = c, not r. So if z is constant, then all points with that z-coordinate are at a fixed height, which is a plane. 

Wait, but let me consider the coordinate systems. In cylindrical coordinates, the position is (r, θ, z). So if z is fixed, then the locus of points where z = c is all points with that z-coordinate, varying r and θ. Since r can be any non-negative value and θ can be any angle, this would form a plane. Because no matter how you rotate around the z-axis (changing θ) or move radially outward (changing r), the height remains the same. 

So yes, in this case, z = c is a plane. Therefore, the correct answer should be (C) Plane.

But wait, let me make sure I'm not confusing this with a cylinder. For example, if the equation was r = c, that would be a cylinder. But since it's z = c, that's not a cylinder. It's a horizontal plane at height z = c. 

Alternatively, if we had θ = c, that would be a plane extending from the z-axis at a fixed angle, but that's not the case here. So yeah, z = c is a plane. Therefore, the answer is (C) Plane.
