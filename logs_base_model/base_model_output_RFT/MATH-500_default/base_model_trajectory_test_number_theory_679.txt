Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie each earned some money selling cookies. They want to pool all their money together and convert as many coins into bills as possible, leaving the leftover in cents. The question is asking how much money, in cents, was left after they converted as many coins into bills as they could.

First, I need to make sure I understand the problem correctly. They have some amount of money each, which is given in dollars with cents. They combine all their earnings into one total amount. Then, they convert as many of the coins into bills as possible. The leftover, which can't be converted into a bill, is what we need to find, and that leftover should be in cents.

Wait, but they already have the amounts in dollars and cents. When they pool their money together, it's going to be a total amount in dollars and cents. Then, they convert the coins (the cents part) into bills. So, the leftover would be the cents part after converting as many cents as possible into whole dollar bills. But since they can only convert whole dollar amounts into bills, the leftover would be the cents that don't make up a whole dollar.

For example, if the total amount is $123.45, then they can convert $123 into bills (like 123 one-dollar bills), and the leftover would be 45 cents. So, the answer would be 45 cents.

But wait, the problem says they converted as many of the coins into bills as they could. So, the leftover is the amount that can't be converted into a whole dollar. So, essentially, the leftover is the cents part of the total amount. Because any whole dollar can be converted into a bill. So, the leftover is the cents part. But wait, let me check.

Wait, but the total amount might have both dollars and cents. When they convert as many coins into bills as possible, they can take any number of cents and convert them into dollars. But each dollar is 100 cents. So, the leftover would be the total cents modulo 100. Because you can take as many hundreds as possible out of the total cents, leaving the remainder.

But wait, the total amount is already in dollars and cents. So, for example, if the total is $X.YZ, then the total amount in cents is X*100 + Y*10 + Z cents. Wait, no. Wait, $X.YZ is equal to X * 100 + Y * 10 + Z cents. So, the total in cents is X*100 + Y*10 + Z. Then, when converting to bills, they can take as many 100-cent bills as possible. So, the leftover would be the remainder when the total cents are divided by 100. Which is just the last two digits of the total cents. For example, if the total is 12345 cents, then 12345 divided by 100 is 123 with a remainder of 45. So, the leftover is 45 cents.

Therefore, the problem reduces to adding up all the amounts each girl earned, converting that total into cents, and then finding the remainder when divided by 100. That remainder is the leftover in cents.

So, the steps are:

1. Convert each person's earnings from dollars to cents.
2. Sum all the cents.
3. Divide the total cents by 100, the remainder is the leftover.

But let me confirm with an example. Suppose Linda earned $27.47, which is 27*100 + 47 = 2747 cents. Sherry earned $35.23, which is 35*100 + 23 = 3523 cents. June earned $37.37, which is 37*100 + 37 = 3737 cents. Connie earned $26.52, which is 26*100 + 52 = 2652 cents.

Adding these up: 2747 + 3523 + 3737 + 2652. Let's calculate that.

First, 2747 + 3523 = 6270. Then, 3737 + 2652 = 6389. Then, 6270 + 6389 = 12659 cents. Then, 12659 divided by 100 is 126 with a remainder of 59. So, the leftover would be 59 cents.

But wait, let me check the addition again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's add them step by step:

2747 (Linda) + 3523 (Sherry):

2747 + 3523: 2000 + 3000 = 5000, 700 + 500 = 1200, 40 + 20 = 60, 7 + 3 = 10. So total is 5000 + 1200 = 6200, 6200 + 60 = 6260, 6260 + 10 = 6270. Correct.

3737 (June) + 2652 (Connie):

3000 + 2000 = 5000, 700 + 600 = 1300, 30 + 50 = 80, 7 + 2 = 9. So total is 5000 + 1300 = 6300, 6300 + 80 = 6380, 6380 + 9 = 6389. Correct.

Then, 6270 + 6389:

6000 + 6000 = 12000, 270 + 389 = 659. So total is 12000 + 659 = 12659. Correct.

12659 divided by 100 is 126.59, so the remainder is 59. Therefore, the leftover is 59 cents.

But let me confirm once more. Another way: 12659 cents. To convert to dollars, divide by 100: 126.59 dollars. So, they can take 126 dollars (12600 cents) and have 59 cents left. So, yes, 59 cents is the leftover.

Therefore, the answer should be 59 cents.

But wait, let me check if there's any other interpretation. For example, is the question asking for the amount left after converting as many coins as possible into bills? So, perhaps the total amount is first converted into bills, and the leftover is the cents. But since they already have the total amount in dollars and cents, converting the coins (cents) into bills would just mean taking away the dollar part and leaving the cents. Wait, but the total amount is already in dollars and cents. So, perhaps the total amount in dollars and cents is converted into bills (whole dollars) and the leftover is the cents. So, the leftover is the cents part of the total amount. Therefore, it's equivalent to taking the total amount, converting it to cents, then taking modulo 100. Which is exactly what I did earlier.

Therefore, the answer is 59 cents.
