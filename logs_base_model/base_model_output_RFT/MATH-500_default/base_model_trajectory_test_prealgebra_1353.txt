Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about distributing 54 cards among x players, where each player gets y cards. The constraints are that x is at least 2 and y is at least 5. We need to find how many possible values of x there are. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, the total number of cards is 54. If we distribute these cards equally to x players, each getting y cards, then the equation we can write is x multiplied by y equals 54. So, mathematically, that's x * y = 54. Our goal is to find all possible integer values of x that satisfy the conditions x ≥ 2 and y ≥ 5.

Since both x and y have to be integers (you can't deal a fraction of a card to a player), we need to find all pairs of integers (x, y) such that their product is 54, and both x and y meet the given minimums. Then, we'll count the valid x values.

Let me think. So, first, I need to list all the factors of 54 because x and y must be factors of 54. Let's list the factors of 54. Starting from 1: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54. Wait, but 54 is 54*1, so the factors are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54. But since x has to be at least 2, we can exclude 1. So possible x values from factors are 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54. But we also need to check if the corresponding y values (which would be 54 divided by x) are at least 5.

So, let's go through each possible x and compute y:

1. x = 2: y = 54 / 2 = 27. 27 is ≥ 5. So this is valid.
2. x = 3: y = 54 / 3 = 18. 18 ≥ 5. Valid.
3. x = 6: y = 54 / 6 = 9. 9 ≥ 5. Valid.
4. x = 9: y = 54 / 9 = 6. 6 ≥ 5. Valid.
5. x = 18: y = 54 / 18 = 3. 3 < 5. Invalid.
6. x = 27: y = 54 / 27 = 2. 2 < 5. Invalid.
7. x = 54: y = 54 / 54 = 1. 1 < 5. Invalid.

So, the valid x values are 2, 3, 6, 9. Wait, that's four values. But let me double-check if I missed any factors. The factors of 54 are indeed 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54. So excluding 1, we have 7 factors. Then, when we check each x, only 2, 3, 6, 9 give y ≥ 5. The rest (18, 27, 54) give y less than 5. So, 4 possible x values.

Wait, but hold on. Let me confirm if there are any other factors of 54 that I might have missed. For example, 54 divided by 4 is 13.5, which isn't an integer, so 4 isn't a factor. Similarly, 54 divided by 5 is 10.8, not an integer. 54 divided by 7 is about 7.714, not an integer. So no, the factors are only the ones listed. Therefore, the possible x values are indeed 2, 3, 6, 9. So that's four values.

But wait, let me check if the problem allows for different distributions where y isn't necessarily an integer. Wait, no, the problem says "each player gets y cards," and since you can't split a card, y must be an integer. Therefore, our initial approach is correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this problem. Let me think. Since x and y are integers, x must be a divisor of 54. So, the number of possible x values is the number of divisors of 54 that are ≥2 and for which 54/x ≥5. So, we can model this as:

Find all divisors d of 54 such that d ≥2 and 54/d ≥5. So, 54/d ≥5 implies that d ≤54/5, which is 10.8. So d must be ≤10.8. Since d is an integer, d ≤10. So, the divisors of 54 that are ≥2 and ≤10. Let's list the divisors again: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54. From these, the divisors ≤10 are 2, 3, 6, 9. So again, four divisors. So that confirms the previous result.

Therefore, the number of possible x values is 4. But wait, let me check once more. For each x, y must be at least 5. So, for x=2, y=27 which is okay. x=3, y=18. x=6, y=9. x=9, y=6. All these y values are ≥5. Then x=18, y=3 which is less than 5, so invalid. Similarly, x=27 gives y=2, and x=54 gives y=1, both invalid. So, yes, only 4 valid x values. Therefore, the answer should be 4.

Wait, but let me think again. The problem says "with each player getting y cards." So, does that mean that y must be an integer? Yes, because you can't deal a fraction of a card. So, both x and y have to be integers. Therefore, the initial approach is correct. So, the answer is 4.

But let me check once more. Let's list all possible pairs (x, y):

54 can be factored as:

1 * 54

2 * 27

3 * 18

6 * 9

9 * 6

18 * 3

27 * 2

54 * 1

So, the possible (x, y) pairs where x ≥2 and y ≥5:

Looking at each pair:

1. x=1, y=54: x <2, invalid.

2. x=2, y=27: valid.

3. x=3, y=18: valid.

4. x=6, y=9: valid.

5. x=9, y=6: valid.

6. x=18, y=3: y <5, invalid.

7. x=27, y=2: invalid.

8. x=54, y=1: invalid.

So, only four valid pairs. Therefore, x can be 2, 3, 6, 9. So, four possible values. Therefore, the answer is 4.

I think that's thorough. I considered all possible factors, checked the constraints, and verified each possibility. No mistakes detected in the reasoning. So, the final answer is 4.
Therefore, the number of possible values of $x$ is $\boxed{4}$.
