Okay, let's see. The problem is about Jim and Martha walking to the same corner of a rectangular field. Jim takes the diagonal path, while Martha walks along the length and width. The field is 300 feet wide and 400 feet long. I need to find out how many feet less Jim walks compared to Martha.

Hmm, first, I should visualize the field. It's a rectangle, so opposite sides are equal. The width is 300 feet, and the length is 400 feet. Martha walks along the width and then the length, or vice versa. So her total distance would be the sum of the width and length. Let me calculate that.

Martha's distance = width + length = 300 + 400 = 700 feet. That seems straightforward.

Now Jim walks diagonally across the field. To find the length of the diagonal, I can use the Pythagorean theorem. In a rectangle, the diagonal forms a right triangle with the length and width. So the diagonal (d) would be sqrt(length² + width²).

Let me compute that. The length is 400 feet, so 400 squared is 160,000. The width is 300 feet, so 300 squared is 90,000. Adding those together gives 160,000 + 90,000 = 250,000. Taking the square root of 250,000 gives 500 feet. So Jim walks 500 feet.

Now, to find how much less Jim walks than Martha, I subtract Jim's distance from Martha's. So 700 - 500 = 200 feet. Therefore, Jim walks 200 feet less than Martha.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations. Martha's path is 300 + 400 = 700. Diagonal is sqrt(300² + 400²). 300 squared is 90,000, 400 squared is 160,000. 90k + 160k = 250k. Square root of 250,000 is indeed 500. 700 - 500 is 200. That seems right.

Is there another way to think about this? Maybe using the properties of rectangles or Pythagorean triples. 300, 400, 500 is a classic Pythagorean triple (since 3-4-5 scaled by 100). So that confirms the diagonal is 500. Martha's path is 700. Difference is 200. Yep, that all checks out.

I don't see any mistakes here. The answer should be 200 feet.
