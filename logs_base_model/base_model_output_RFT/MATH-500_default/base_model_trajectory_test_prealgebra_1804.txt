Okay, so I need to find the median number of students in 2005 for these eight counties. Let me start by recalling what a median is. The median is the middle value when all the numbers are arranged in order. Since there are eight counties, which is an even number, the median will be the average of the fourth and fifth numbers after sorting the data.

First, I need to get the 2005 student numbers for each county. Let me list them out from the table:

- Aiken: 136
- Bamberg: 11
- Barnwell: 29
- Berkeley: 524
- Calhoun: 11
- Cherokee: 19
- Chesterfield: 29
- Colleton: 41

Wait, let me double-check each county to make sure I got the numbers right. Sometimes when I list them, I might mix up the counties or the years. Let me go through each row again.

Row 1: Aiken in 2005 is 136. Correct.

Row 2: Bamberg in 2005 is 11. That's the lowest number here.

Row 3: Barnwell in 2005 is 29. Hmm, that's higher than Bamberg's 11 but lower than others.

Row 4: Berkeley jumps up to 524 in 2005. Wow, that's a big jump from previous years.

Row 5: Calhoun is 11 again. So two counties with 11 students in 2005.

Row 6: Cherokee is 19. So that's higher than Calhoun and Bamberg but lower than others.

Row 7: Chesterfield is 29. Same as Barnwell and Bamberg? Wait, no. Let me check the original table again.

Wait, the original table shows for Chesterfield in 2005: 29. Yes, that's correct. So that's the same as Barnwell's 29.

Row 8: Colleton is 41. So that's higher than Cherokee's 19 but lower than others.

Wait, let me list all the 2005 numbers again to make sure I didn't miss any:

Aiken: 136

Bamberg: 11

Barnwell: 29

Berkeley: 524

Calhoun: 11

Cherokee: 19

Chesterfield: 29

Colleton: 41

Yes, that's all eight. Now, I need to sort these numbers in ascending order to find the median.

Let me arrange them step by step. Starting with the lowest:

11 (Bamberg), 11 (Calhoun), 19 (Cherokee), 29 (Barnwell), 29 (Chesterfield), 41 (Colleton), 136 (Aiken), 524 (Berkeley)

Wait, let me verify each number:

- The smallest is 11 (Bamberg and Calhoun). Then 19 (Cherokee). Next, 29 (Barnwell and Chesterfield). Then 41 (Colleton), followed by 136 (Aiken), and the largest is 524 (Berkeley).

So sorted order: 11, 11, 19, 29, 29, 41, 136, 524.

Since there are eight numbers, the median will be the average of the fourth and fifth numbers. Let's count them:

1st: 11

2nd: 11

3rd: 19

4th: 29

5th: 29

6th: 41

7th: 136

8th: 524

So the fourth number is 29 and the fifth number is also 29. Therefore, the median is (29 + 29)/2 = 29.

Wait, but let me check again. Sometimes when there are duplicates, the median might seem straightforward, but I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the order.

Let me list them again in order:

11, 11, 19, 29, 29, 41, 136, 524.

Yes, that's correct. Fourth and fifth are both 29. So average is 29. Therefore, the median is 29.

But wait, just to be thorough, let me recount the positions. Let's assign positions:

1: 11

2: 11

3: 19

4: 29

5: 29

6: 41

7: 136

8: 524

Yes, positions 4 and 5 are both 29, so the median is indeed 29. Therefore, the answer should be 29.
