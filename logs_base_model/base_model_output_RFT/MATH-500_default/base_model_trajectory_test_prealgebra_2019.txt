Okay, so I need to figure out what 9 divided by 2 is as a decimal. Let me start by recalling how division works. When you divide a number by another, you're essentially finding out how many times the divisor fits into the dividend. In this case, 9 divided by 2. 

Hmm, 2 goes into 9 how many times? Well, 2 times 4 is 8, which is less than 9, and 2 times 5 is 10, which is too big. So it goes in 4 times with a remainder of 1. But since we want a decimal, I need to handle that remainder. 

So after 2 times 4 is 8, subtracting that from 9 leaves a remainder of 1. To convert the remainder to a decimal, I can add a decimal point and a zero, making it 10. Then, 2 goes into 10 exactly 5 times. So putting that together, the division gives 4.5. 

Wait, let me verify that. If I multiply 2 by 4.5, does that equal 9? 2 times 4 is 8, and 2 times 0.5 is 1, so 8 plus 1 is 9. Yep, that checks out. 

Alternatively, maybe I can think of 9 divided by 2 as a fraction first. The fraction is 9/2, which can be expressed as a mixed number. Since 2 goes into 9 four times with a remainder of 1, that's 4 and 1/2. And 1/2 is equal to 0.5 in decimal. So adding that to 4 gives 4.5. That's another way to confirm it. 

I could also use long division to double-check. Let's do that step by step. 

Dividing 9 by 2:

- 2 into 9: 4 times (since 2*4=8). Subtract 8 from 9, remainder is 1.
- Bring down a 0 to make it 10.
- 2 into 10 is 5 times (2*5=10). Subtract 10 from 10, remainder 0.
- Since there's no remainder and no more digits to bring down, the division ends here.

So the quotient is 4.5. 

Another approach: Since 2 is a factor of 10, maybe I can convert the denominator to 10 by multiplying numerator and denominator by 5. So 9/2 becomes (9*5)/(2*5) = 45/10 = 4.5. That's straightforward. 

Wait, so all these methods are leading me to the same answer. That gives me confidence that 9/2 as a decimal is indeed 4.5. 

Is there any chance I could have made a mistake here? Let me think. If I had divided 2 into 9 incorrectly, maybe. For example, if I thought 2 goes into 9 three times instead of four, but 2*3=6, which is less than 9. Then the remainder would be 3, which would lead to a different decimal. But that's not the case here. The correct quotient is 4 with a remainder of 1. 

Also, when converting to decimal, I added a decimal point and a zero, which is standard. Then dividing 10 by 2 gives 5, so the decimal is 4.5. 

All right, I think I've checked this from multiple angles. The answer should be 4.5. No discrepancies in the methods I used. So I can confidently say that 9/2 is 4.5 in decimal form.
Therefore, $\frac{9}{2}$ expressed as a decimal is $\boxed{4.5}$.
