Okay, so I need to find the minimum value of (x + y)(y + z) given that x, y, z are positive real numbers and satisfy the condition xyz(x + y + z) = 1. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem.

First, the expression we need to minimize is (x + y)(y + z). Let me expand that to see if it simplifies or if there's a pattern. Expanding (x + y)(y + z) gives:

x*y + x*z + y*y + y*z = xy + xz + y² + yz.

So, it's xy + xz + y² + yz. Hmm, that's a quadratic in terms of y? Maybe not directly helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can use some inequality here, like AM-GM or Cauchy-Schwarz.

The constraint is xyz(x + y + z) = 1. Let's denote S = x + y + z. Then the constraint becomes xyzS = 1. So, xyzS = 1. Maybe I can express one variable in terms of the others using this constraint, but that might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can use substitution or homogenization.

Wait, since all variables are positive, maybe substituting variables with some symmetry could help. Let me see. If I set variables such that x = a, y = b, z = c, but that doesn't seem to help immediately. Alternatively, maybe using Lagrange multipliers? Since this is an optimization problem with a constraint. Let's consider that.

Let me recall that with Lagrange multipliers, we can set up the gradients of the function to be minimized and the constraint to be proportional. So, if f(x, y, z) = (x + y)(y + z) and the constraint is g(x, y, z) = xyz(x + y + z) - 1 = 0, then ∇f = λ∇g.

Calculating the partial derivatives:

First, ∇f = (df/dx, df/dy, df/dz). Let's compute each component.

df/dx = derivative of (x + y)(y + z) with respect to x is (1)(y + z) = y + z.

df/dy = derivative with respect to y is (x + y)(0 + 1) + (y + z)(1 + 0) = (x + y) + (y + z) = x + 2y + z.

df/dz = derivative with respect to z is (x + y)(1) + (y + z)(0) = x + y.

Now, ∇g. Let's compute the partial derivatives of g = xyz(x + y + z) - 1.

First, partial derivative with respect to x:

dg/dx = yz(x + y + z) + xyz(1) = yz(x + y + z) + xyz.

Similarly, dg/dy = xz(x + y + z) + xyz(1) = xz(x + y + z) + xyz.

dg/dz = xy(x + y + z) + xyz(1) = xy(x + y + z) + xyz.

Therefore, ∇g = (yz(x + y + z) + xyz, xz(x + y + z) + xyz, xy(x + y + z) + xyz).

According to Lagrange multipliers, ∇f = λ∇g. So, we have the following equations:

1. y + z = λ(yz(x + y + z) + xyz)
2. x + 2y + z = λ(xz(x + y + z) + xyz)
3. x + y = λ(xy(x + y + z) + xyz)

Hmm, these equations look a bit messy. Maybe we can simplify them by dividing or substituting. Let's see.

First, notice that the constraint xyz(x + y + z) = 1. Let me denote that as xyzS = 1, where S = x + y + z. Then, the denominators in the Lagrange equations can be written as xyzS, which is 1. Wait, let me check.

Wait, in the first equation, ∇g's x-component is yzS + xyz. But xyzS = 1, so this becomes yzS + 1. Similarly for the others. Wait, is that correct?

Wait, if S = x + y + z, then dg/dx = yzS + xyz = yz(S + x). Similarly, dg/dy = xzS + xyz = xz(S + y), and dg/dz = xyS + xyz = xy(S + z). So, actually, ∇g = (yz(S + x), xz(S + y), xy(S + z)).

Therefore, the equations become:

1. y + z = λ yz(S + x)
2. x + 2y + z = λ xz(S + y)
3. x + y = λ xy(S + z)

And we have the constraint xyzS = 1.

Hmm, so perhaps we can find ratios here. Let's divide equation 1 by equation 3.

Equation 1: (y + z) / (x + y) = [λ yz(S + x)] / [λ xy(S + z)] = [yz(S + x)] / [xy(S + z)] = [z(S + x)] / [x(S + z)]

Similarly, equation 2 divided by equation 3:

Equation 2 / Equation 3: [x + 2y + z] / [x + y] = [xz(S + y)] / [xy(S + z)] = [z(S + y)] / [y(S + z)]

So, let's denote equation 1 / equation 3 ratio as R1 = [z(S + x)] / [x(S + z)] = (y + z)/(x + y)

Similarly, equation 2 / equation 3 ratio as R2 = [z(S + y)] / [y(S + z)] = (x + 2y + z)/(x + y)

So, let's write these two ratios:

R1 = [z(S + x)] / [x(S + z)] = (y + z)/(x + y)

R2 = [z(S + y)] / [y(S + z)] = (x + 2y + z)/(x + y)

Hmm, these ratios might help us find relationships between variables. Let's try to manipulate R1 and R2.

From R1:

[z(S + x)] / [x(S + z)] = (y + z)/(x + y)

Cross-multiplying:

z(S + x)(x + y) = x(S + z)(y + z)

Similarly, expand both sides:

Left side: z(S + x)(x + y) = z[ Sx + x² + Sy + xy ]

Right side: x(S + z)(y + z) = x[ Sy + Sz + zy + z² ] = x[ Sy + Sz + yz + z² ]

So, left side: zSx + zx² + zSy + zxy

Right side: xSy + xSz + xyz + xz²

Hmm, let's write all terms:

Left: zSx + zx² + zSy + zxy

Right: xSy + xSz + xyz + xz²

Let's subtract right side from left side:

(zSx + zx² + zSy + zxy) - (xSy + xSz + xyz + xz²) = 0

Simplify term by term:

zSx - xSy - xSz = zxS - xSy - xSz = xS(z - y - z) = xS(-y) = -xSy

zx² - xz² = xz(x - z)

zSy - xyz = yz(S - x)

Wait, perhaps I should group differently. Wait, maybe factor terms:

Looking at the terms:

zSx - xSy = xS(z - y)

zx² - xz² = xz(x - z)

zSy - xyz = zy(S - x)

Hmm, so overall:

xS(z - y) + xz(x - z) + zy(S - x) = 0

Hmm, maybe factor out x from the first two terms:

x[S(z - y) + z(x - z)] + zy(S - x) = 0

Compute S(z - y) + z(x - z):

S(z - y) + z(x - z) = zS - yS + zx - z²

But S = x + y + z, so substitute:

z(x + y + z) - y(x + y + z) + zx - z²

= zx + zy + z² - yx - y² - yz + zx - z²

Simplify:

zx + zy + z² - yx - y² - yz + zx - z²

= (zx + zx) + (zy - yz) + (z² - z²) - yx - y²

= 2zx + 0 + 0 - yx - y²

= 2zx - yx - y²

Factor:

x(2z - y) - y²

So, putting back into the equation:

x[ x(2z - y) - y² ] + zy(S - x) = 0

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps assuming some symmetry. Let's suppose that x = z. Maybe that could simplify things.

Let me try setting x = z. Then, in the original problem, variables x, y, z are positive real numbers with xyz(x + y + z) = 1. If x = z, then the constraint becomes x y x (x + y + x) = x² y (2x + y) = 1.

The expression to minimize becomes (x + y)(y + x) = (x + y)². So, if x = z, then (x + y)(y + z) becomes (x + y)². Interesting.

So, if we can minimize (x + y)² under the constraint x² y (2x + y) = 1. Let's see if this is easier.

Let me denote t = x/y. Then, x = ty. Then, substituting into the constraint:

(ty)² y (2 ty + y) = t² y² * y * y(2t + 1) = t² y³ * y(2t + 1) = t² (2t + 1) y⁴ = 1.

So, y⁴ = 1 / [t²(2t + 1)]. Then, y = [1 / (t²(2t + 1))]^{1/4}.

Then, (x + y)² = (ty + y)² = y²(t + 1)². Substitute y² from above:

y² = [1 / (t²(2t + 1))]^{1/2} = 1 / sqrt(t²(2t + 1)).

Thus, (x + y)² = (t + 1)² / sqrt(t²(2t + 1)).

Let me define f(t) = (t + 1)² / sqrt(t²(2t + 1)).

We need to find the minimum of f(t) over t > 0.

This seems more manageable. Let's compute f(t):

f(t) = (t + 1)² / [sqrt(t²(2t + 1))] = (t + 1)² / [t sqrt(2t + 1)].

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= (t² + 2t + 1) / [t sqrt(2t + 1)] = [ (t² + 2t + 1) ] / [ t (2t + 1)^{1/2} ]

Let me write this as:

= (t² + 2t + 1) / ( t (2t + 1)^{1/2} )

Maybe substitute u = sqrt(2t + 1). Let me see.

Let u = sqrt(2t + 1). Then, u² = 2t + 1 => t = (u² - 1)/2.

Then, substitute into f(t):

Numerator: t² + 2t + 1 = [(u² - 1)/2]^2 + 2*(u² - 1)/2 + 1

Compute each term:

[(u² - 1)/2]^2 = (u⁴ - 2u² + 1)/4

2*(u² - 1)/2 = (u² - 1)

So, numerator:

= (u⁴ - 2u² + 1)/4 + (u² - 1) + 1

= (u⁴ - 2u² + 1)/4 + (u² - 1 + 4)/4

= (u⁴ - 2u² + 1 + 4u² - 4 + 4)/4

= (u⁴ + 2u² + 1)/4

Denominator: t * u = [(u² - 1)/2] * u = [u³ - u]/2

Thus, f(t) = [ (u⁴ + 2u² + 1)/4 ] / [ (u³ - u)/2 ] = [ (u⁴ + 2u² + 1)/4 ] * [ 2 / (u³ - u) ] = (u⁴ + 2u² + 1)/(2(u³ - u))

Note that u⁴ + 2u² + 1 = (u² + 1)^2. So,

f(t) = (u² + 1)^2 / [2u(u² - 1)]

Let me write this as:

f(u) = (u² + 1)^2 / [2u(u² - 1)]

Now, to minimize f(u) over u > 1, since t > 0 and u = sqrt(2t + 1) > 1 (since t > 0).

Let me set v = u². Then, since u > 1, v > 1.

Then, f(u) = (v + 1)^2 / [2u(v - 1)] = (v + 1)^2 / [2 sqrt(v) (v - 1)]

Hmm, maybe express in terms of v:

f(v) = (v + 1)^2 / [2 sqrt(v) (v - 1)]

We need to minimize f(v) for v > 1.

Let me take the derivative of f(v) with respect to v and set it to zero.

First, compute f(v):

f(v) = (v + 1)^2 / [2 sqrt(v) (v - 1)]

Let me write this as f(v) = (v + 1)^2 / [2 (v - 1) v^{1/2} ] = (v + 1)^2 / [2 (v - 1) v^{1/2} ]

Let me compute the derivative f’(v):

Using the quotient rule:

Let numerator N = (v + 1)^2, denominator D = 2 (v - 1) v^{1/2}

Then, f’(v) = (N’ D - N D’) / D²

Compute N’:

N = (v + 1)^2 => N’ = 2(v + 1)

Compute D:

D = 2 (v - 1) v^{1/2}

Compute D’:

First, derivative of (v - 1) v^{1/2}:

Let’s denote A = (v - 1) v^{1/2}

A’ = derivative of (v - 1) * derivative of v^{1/2} + (v - 1) * derivative of v^{1/2}

Wait, no. Wait, it's (v - 1) multiplied by v^{1/2}, so derivative is:

A’ = (1) * v^{1/2} + (v - 1) * (1/2) v^{-1/2} = v^{1/2} + (v - 1)/(2 v^{1/2})

Therefore, D = 2 A, so D’ = 2 A’ = 2 [ v^{1/2} + (v - 1)/(2 v^{1/2}) ] = 2 v^{1/2} + (v - 1)/v^{1/2}

Simplify:

= 2 v^{1/2} + (v - 1)/v^{1/2} = [2 v + (v - 1)] / v^{1/2} = (3v - 1)/v^{1/2}

Therefore, D’ = (3v - 1)/v^{1/2}

So, putting back into f’(v):

N’ D - N D’ = 2(v + 1) * 2 (v - 1) v^{1/2} - (v + 1)^2 * (3v - 1)/v^{1/2}

Wait, no. Wait, the derivative f’(v) = (N’ D - N D’) / D²

But N = (v + 1)^2, N’ = 2(v + 1)

D = 2 (v - 1) v^{1/2}, D’ = (3v - 1)/v^{1/2}

Therefore:

N’ D = 2(v + 1) * 2 (v - 1) v^{1/2} = 4 (v + 1)(v - 1) v^{1/2}

N D’ = (v + 1)^2 * (3v - 1)/v^{1/2}

So, f’(v) = [4 (v + 1)(v - 1) v^{1/2} - (v + 1)^2 (3v - 1)/v^{1/2}] / [ (2 (v - 1) v^{1/2})^2 ]

Simplify numerator:

Factor out (v + 1)/v^{1/2}:

= (v + 1)/v^{1/2} [4 (v - 1) v - (v + 1)(3v - 1) ]

Let me compute the term inside the brackets:

4 (v - 1) v - (v + 1)(3v - 1)

First term: 4v(v - 1) = 4v² - 4v

Second term: (v + 1)(3v - 1) = 3v² - v + 3v - 1 = 3v² + 2v - 1

So, subtracting:

4v² - 4v - (3v² + 2v - 1) = 4v² - 4v - 3v² - 2v + 1 = v² - 6v + 1

Therefore, numerator becomes:

(v + 1)/v^{1/2} (v² - 6v + 1)

Denominator of f’(v): [2 (v - 1) v^{1/2}]^2 = 4 (v - 1)^2 v

Therefore, f’(v) = [ (v + 1)(v² - 6v + 1) / v^{1/2} ] / [4 (v - 1)^2 v ] = (v + 1)(v² - 6v + 1) / [4 (v - 1)^2 v^{3/2} ]

Set f’(v) = 0:

The numerator must be zero: (v + 1)(v² - 6v + 1) = 0

Since v > 1, v + 1 ≠ 0. So, solve v² - 6v + 1 = 0.

Solutions: v = [6 ± sqrt(36 - 4)] / 2 = [6 ± sqrt(32)] / 2 = [6 ± 4 sqrt(2)] / 2 = 3 ± 2 sqrt(2)

Since v > 1, both 3 + 2 sqrt(2) ≈ 3 + 2.828 ≈ 5.828 and 3 - 2 sqrt(2) ≈ 3 - 2.828 ≈ 0.172. But since v > 1, only v = 3 + 2 sqrt(2) is valid.

Therefore, critical point at v = 3 + 2 sqrt(2). Let's check if this is a minimum.

Second derivative test might be complicated, but since it's the only critical point in v > 1 and considering the behavior as v approaches 1+ and infinity, likely this is the minimum.

So, v = 3 + 2 sqrt(2). Then, u = sqrt(v) = sqrt(3 + 2 sqrt(2)). Let's compute u.

Note that sqrt(3 + 2 sqrt(2)) can be simplified. Suppose sqrt(3 + 2 sqrt(2)) = sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Then, squaring both sides:

3 + 2 sqrt(2) = a + b + 2 sqrt(ab)

Therefore, we need a + b = 3 and 2 sqrt(ab) = 2 sqrt(2). So, sqrt(ab) = sqrt(2) => ab = 2.

Solving a + b = 3 and ab = 2. The solutions are a = 1, b = 2. Therefore, sqrt(3 + 2 sqrt(2)) = sqrt(1) + sqrt(2) = 1 + sqrt(2).

So, u = 1 + sqrt(2). Therefore, t = (u² - 1)/2.

Compute u²: (1 + sqrt(2))² = 1 + 2 sqrt(2) + 2 = 3 + 2 sqrt(2). Therefore, t = (3 + 2 sqrt(2) - 1)/2 = (2 + 2 sqrt(2))/2 = 1 + sqrt(2).

Thus, t = 1 + sqrt(2). Then, recall that t = x/y, so x = (1 + sqrt(2)) y.

Now, going back to the constraint x² y (2x + y) = 1.

Substitute x = (1 + sqrt(2)) y:

[(1 + sqrt(2)) y]^2 * y * [2*(1 + sqrt(2)) y + y] = 1

Compute each term:

First term: [(1 + sqrt(2)) y]^2 = (1 + 2 sqrt(2) + 2) y² = (3 + 2 sqrt(2)) y²

Second term: y

Third term: 2*(1 + sqrt(2)) y + y = [2 + 2 sqrt(2) + 1] y = (3 + 2 sqrt(2)) y

Multiply all together:

(3 + 2 sqrt(2)) y² * y * (3 + 2 sqrt(2)) y = (3 + 2 sqrt(2))² y⁴ = 1

Compute (3 + 2 sqrt(2))²: 9 + 12 sqrt(2) + 8 = 17 + 12 sqrt(2)

Thus, (17 + 12 sqrt(2)) y⁴ = 1 => y⁴ = 1 / (17 + 12 sqrt(2))

Compute y² = 1 / sqrt(17 + 12 sqrt(2)). Let's rationalize sqrt(17 + 12 sqrt(2)).

Suppose sqrt(17 + 12 sqrt(2)) = sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Then, squaring:

17 + 12 sqrt(2) = a + b + 2 sqrt(ab)

Thus, a + b = 17 and 2 sqrt(ab) = 12 sqrt(2) => sqrt(ab) = 6 sqrt(2) => ab = 72.

Solving a + b = 17 and ab = 72. The solutions are a = 8, b = 9 (since 8 + 9 = 17 and 8*9 = 72). Therefore, sqrt(17 + 12 sqrt(2)) = sqrt(8) + sqrt(9) = 2 sqrt(2) + 3.

Therefore, sqrt(17 + 12 sqrt(2)) = 3 + 2 sqrt(2). Therefore, y² = 1 / (3 + 2 sqrt(2)).

Again, rationalize 1 / (3 + 2 sqrt(2)):

Multiply numerator and denominator by (3 - 2 sqrt(2)):

= [1 * (3 - 2 sqrt(2))] / [(3 + 2 sqrt(2))(3 - 2 sqrt(2))] = (3 - 2 sqrt(2)) / (9 - 8) = 3 - 2 sqrt(2).

Therefore, y² = 3 - 2 sqrt(2). Therefore, y = sqrt(3 - 2 sqrt(2)).

Again, sqrt(3 - 2 sqrt(2)) can be simplified. Suppose sqrt(3 - 2 sqrt(2)) = sqrt(a) - sqrt(b). Then, squaring:

3 - 2 sqrt(2) = a + b - 2 sqrt(ab)

Thus, a + b = 3 and 2 sqrt(ab) = 2 sqrt(2) => sqrt(ab) = sqrt(2) => ab = 2.

Solving a + b = 3, ab = 2. Solutions are a = 1, b = 2. Therefore, sqrt(3 - 2 sqrt(2)) = sqrt(2) - 1.

Therefore, y = sqrt(2) - 1.

Then, x = (1 + sqrt(2)) y = (1 + sqrt(2))(sqrt(2) - 1).

Compute this:

= (1)(sqrt(2) - 1) + sqrt(2)(sqrt(2) - 1) = sqrt(2) - 1 + 2 - sqrt(2) = (sqrt(2) - sqrt(2)) + (-1 + 2) = 0 + 1 = 1.

So, x = 1.

Then, since x = 1, y = sqrt(2) - 1, and z = x = 1.

Therefore, in this case, x = z = 1, y = sqrt(2) - 1.

Now, let's compute (x + y)(y + z):

x + y = 1 + (sqrt(2) - 1) = sqrt(2)

y + z = (sqrt(2) - 1) + 1 = sqrt(2)

Therefore, (x + y)(y + z) = sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) = 2.

Therefore, the minimum value is 2.

But wait, I need to confirm if this is indeed the minimum. Let's check another approach without assuming x = z. Maybe using AM-GM or another inequality.

Alternatively, let's consider the expression (x + y)(y + z). Let me expand it again:

(x + y)(y + z) = xy + xz + y² + yz.

Hmm. The constraint is xyz(x + y + z) = 1. Let's denote S = x + y + z.

So, xyzS = 1.

We need to minimize E = xy + xz + y² + yz.

Let me group terms:

E = y(x + z) + xz + y².

But from S = x + y + z, x + z = S - y.

Therefore, E = y(S - y) + xz + y² = yS - y² + xz + y² = yS + xz.

So, E = yS + xz.

So, now we need to minimize yS + xz, given that xyzS = 1.

Hmm, so E = yS + xz. Let me denote this as E = yS + xz.

We can use AM-GM on terms yS and xz. But first, let's express variables in terms of S.

But S = x + y + z. So, perhaps express xz in terms of S.

Alternatively, since xyzS = 1, we can write xz = 1 / (y S). Therefore, E = yS + 1/(y S).

Thus, E = yS + 1/(y S).

Let me set t = yS. Then, E = t + 1/t. The minimum of t + 1/t is 2, achieved when t = 1.

Therefore, E ≥ 2, with equality when t = 1, i.e., yS = 1.

But since xyzS = 1, and yS = 1, then xz = 1 / (y S) = 1 / 1 = 1.

Therefore, when yS = 1 and xz = 1, we have E = 2.

Therefore, the minimum value of E is 2.

Therefore, the minimal value of (x + y)(y + z) is 2.

This aligns with the earlier result when we assumed x = z. So, even without assuming symmetry, we can see that the minimum is 2.

Therefore, the answer is 2.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{2}
Therefore, the minimum value of \((x + y)(y + z)\) is \boxed{2}.
