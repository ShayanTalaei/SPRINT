Okay, so I need to find the smallest possible integer value for x such that f(x) = sqrt(x - 1)/(x - 2) is a real number. Let's start by understanding what makes a function have a real number value. 

First, the numerator is a square root, sqrt(x - 1). For the square root to be real, the expression inside must be non-negative. That means x - 1 ≥ 0, so x ≥ 1. Got that. 

Then, the denominator is x - 2. For the function to be defined, the denominator can't be zero because division by zero is undefined. So x - 2 ≠ 0, which means x ≠ 2. 

So combining these two conditions: x must be greater than or equal to 1, but not equal to 2. Therefore, the domain of f(x) is [1, 2) union (2, ∞). 

Now, the question asks for the smallest integer x in this domain. Let's list the integers starting from the smallest. The integers greater than or equal to 1 are 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. But x can't be 2, so we need to check if x = 1 is allowed. 

Wait, x = 1: let's plug it into f(x). The numerator becomes sqrt(1 - 1) = sqrt(0) = 0, and the denominator is 1 - 2 = -1. So f(1) = 0/-1 = 0. That's a real number. So x = 1 is valid. 

But hold on, the domain was [1, 2) union (2, ∞). So x = 1 is included in [1, 2), which is allowed. So the smallest integer x is 1. 

But wait, let me double-check. Is there a possibility that x = 1 might cause any issues? The denominator is -1, which is fine, and the square root is zero, so the result is 0. That's perfectly valid. 

Is there a smaller integer? The integers start at 1, so 1 is the smallest. Therefore, the answer should be 1. 

Wait, but let me confirm once again. The problem says "smallest possible integer value for x". Since x must be at least 1, and 1 is an integer, and x = 1 works, then yes, 1 is the answer. 

But just to make sure I didn't miss any other constraints. Let's check x = 1: f(1) = 0, which is real. x = 2 is excluded because denominator is zero. x = 0: less than 1, so not allowed. x = 1.5: that's a real number, but not integer. The question specifically asks for integer x. So the next integer after 1 is 2, but 2 is excluded. So 1 is indeed the smallest integer. 

Therefore, the answer is 1.
