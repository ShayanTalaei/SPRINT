Okay, so I need to find the remainder when the sum of numbers from 1 to 12 is divided by 4. Let me start by recalling how to calculate the sum of consecutive numbers. I remember there's a formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers, which is n(n + 1)/2. Let me verify that with a small example. If n is 3, the sum is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, and using the formula, 3*4/2 = 12/2 = 6. Yep, that works. So applying this formula here, where n is 12, the sum should be 12*13/2. Let me calculate that: 12 divided by 2 is 6, and 6 multiplied by 13 is... 78. So the total sum is 78. Now, I need to find 78 modulo 4. To do that, I can divide 78 by 4 and find the remainder. Let's see, 4 times 19 is 76, because 4*20 is 80, so 80 minus 4 is 76. Then 78 minus 76 is 2. So the remainder is 2. Therefore, the modulo 4 remainder of the sum is 2. 

Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, the formula: sum = n(n + 1)/2. For n=12, that's 12*13/2. 12 divided by 2 is 6, 6*13 is indeed 78. Then 78 divided by 4. 4*19 is 76, 78-76=2. So remainder 2. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can add the numbers step by step and see if the intermediate sums also give the same remainder. Let's try that. 1 + 2 = 3. 3 + 3 = 6. 6 + 4 = 10. 10 + 5 = 15. 15 + 6 = 21. 21 + 7 = 28. 28 + 8 = 36. 36 + 9 = 45. 45 + 10 = 55. 55 + 11 = 66. 66 + 12 = 78. Yep, same total. Then 78 divided by 4. Let me check division again. 4*10=40, 4*20=80. 78 is between 4*19=76 and 4*20=80. 78-76=2, so remainder is 2. 

Alternatively, another way to compute modulo 4 is to take each number modulo 4 first, then sum those remainders, and then take that sum modulo 4. Let's try that. The numbers from 1 to 12:

1 mod 4 = 1

2 mod 4 = 2

3 mod 4 = 3

4 mod 4 = 0

5 mod 4 = 1

6 mod 4 = 2

7 mod 4 = 3

8 mod 4 = 0

9 mod 4 = 1

10 mod 4 = 2

11 mod 4 = 3

12 mod 4 = 0

Now add these remainders: 1 + 2 + 3 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 0. Let's compute step by step:

1 + 2 = 3

3 + 3 = 6

6 + 0 = 6

6 + 1 = 7

7 + 2 = 9

9 + 3 = 12

12 + 0 = 12

12 + 1 = 13

13 + 2 = 15

15 + 3 = 18

18 + 0 = 18

Now sum of remainders is 18. Then 18 mod 4: 4*4=16, 18-16=2. So remainder 2. Same result. That confirms the answer. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern in the remainders. Let's see, the numbers 1 to 4: remainders 1,2,3,0. Then 5 to 8: 1,2,3,0. 9 to 12: 1,2,3,0. So three groups of four numbers, each group summing to 1+2+3+0=6. So three groups: 6*3=18. 18 mod 4=2. Yep, same thing. 

So all methods lead to the remainder being 2. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 2.
Therefore, the modulo 4 remainder of the sum is $\boxed{2}$.
