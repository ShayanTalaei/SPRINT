Okay, so I need to find the minimum value of the expression (a + b + c + d)(1/a + 1/b + 1/c + 1/d) where a, b, c, d are positive real numbers. Hmm, let's start by recalling some inequalities that might be useful here. The expression reminds me of something related to the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or maybe the AM-GM inequality. Let me think.

First, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any real numbers, (x1y1 + x2y2 + ... + xnyn)^2 ≤ (x1² + x2² + ... + xn²)(y1² + y2² + ... + yn²). Maybe I can apply this here. If I let xi = sqrt(ai) and yi = 1/sqrt(ai), then the product (a + b + c + d)(1/a + 1/b + 1/c + 1/d) would be similar to (x1² + x2² + x3² + x4²)(y1² + y2² + y3² + y4²). According to Cauchy-Schwarz, this product should be greater than or equal to (x1y1 + x2y2 + x3y3 + x4y4)^2. Let's compute that.

x1y1 = sqrt(a)*(1/sqrt(a)) = 1, similarly for the others. So the sum x1y1 + x2y2 + x3y3 + x4y4 is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4. Therefore, by Cauchy-Schwarz, the original expression is ≥ 4² = 16. So the minimum value is at least 16. 

But wait, does equality hold here? For Cauchy-Schwarz, equality holds when xi/yi is constant for all i. In this case, xi = sqrt(ai), yi = 1/sqrt(ai), so xi/yi = ai. So for equality, ai must be constant for all i. That is, a = b = c = d. If all variables are equal, say a = b = c = d = k, then the expression becomes 4k*(4/k) = 16. So yes, equality holds when all variables are equal. Therefore, the minimum value is indeed 16.

Wait, but let me check if there's another approach, maybe using AM-GM. Let's see. The AM-GM inequality states that for positive numbers, the arithmetic mean is at least the geometric mean. Let's try expanding the expression (a + b + c + d)(1/a + 1/b + 1/c + 1/d). 

Multiplying out, we get:

a*(1/a) + a*(1/b) + a*(1/c) + a*(1/d) + 
b*(1/a) + b*(1/b) + b*(1/c) + b*(1/d) + 
c*(1/a) + c*(1/b) + c*(1/c) + c*(1/d) + 
d*(1/a) + d*(1/b) + d*(1/c) + d*(1/d)

Simplifying each term:

a*(1/a) = 1, similarly for the rest. So there are 4 terms that are 1: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4.

Then the other terms are cross terms: a/b, a/c, a/d, b/a, b/c, b/d, c/a, c/b, c/d, d/a, d/b, d/c. So that's 12 terms. So the entire expression is 4 + sum of these 12 cross terms.

So the expression is 4 + Σ(a/b + b/a) for all distinct pairs (a, b), (a, c), etc. Wait, but there are 12 terms. Let's see: for each pair of variables, there are two terms: a/b and b/a. Since there are 4 variables, the number of unordered pairs is C(4,2) = 6. So for each pair, we have a/b + b/a. Therefore, the sum is Σ(a/b + b/a) for all 6 pairs. 

So the expression is 4 + Σ(a/b + b/a) over all 6 pairs. Now, each a/b + b/a is ≥ 2 by AM-GM, since (a/b + b/a)/2 ≥ sqrt(a/b * b/a) = 1. Therefore, each of these 6 terms is at least 2, so the total sum is at least 6*2 = 12. Therefore, the entire expression is at least 4 + 12 = 16. So again, we get the minimum is 16 when each a/b + b/a = 2, which occurs when a = b for all pairs. So again, equality when all variables are equal.

Therefore, both Cauchy-Schwarz and AM-GM approaches lead us to the same conclusion. So the minimum value is 16.

But just to make sure, let's test with actual numbers. Let's take a = b = c = d = 1. Then the expression becomes (1+1+1+1)(1+1+1+1) = 4*4 = 16. That works. What if we take different numbers? Let's say a = 2, b = c = d = 1. Then the sum is 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5. The reciprocals are 1/2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.5. Then 5*3.5 = 17.5, which is greater than 16. If we take a = 1, b = 1, c = 1, d = 2, same thing. If we try a = 2, b = 2, c = 2, d = 2, then it's 8*(4/2) = 8*2 = 16. So even when variables are equal, whether all 1s or all 2s, it's 16. If we take variables not all equal, the value increases. So yes, 16 is indeed the minimum.

Alternatively, let's try another approach. Suppose we fix three variables and vary the fourth. Let me see. But this might be more complicated. Alternatively, maybe use Lagrange multipliers, but that might be overkill.

Wait, but maybe I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers here. Let me set up the function f(a,b,c,d) = (a + b + c + d)(1/a + 1/b + 1/c + 1/d). We need to find its minimum for positive a, b, c, d.

Taking partial derivatives might be messy, but perhaps we can assume symmetry. Suppose that at the minimum, a = b = c = d. Let’s check if this is a critical point. Let’s set a = b = c = d = k. Then f(k,k,k,k) = (4k)(4/k) = 16. Now, compute the partial derivative of f with respect to a at this point. Let's see:

df/da = (1)(1/a + 1/b + 1/c + 1/d) + (a + b + c + d)(-1/a²)

At a = b = c = d = k, this becomes:

(1)(4/k) + (4k)(-1/k²) = 4/k - 4/k = 0. Similarly, all partial derivatives are zero. So this is a critical point. Since we already saw that the function is convex and the critical point is unique under symmetry, this must be the global minimum.

Therefore, all methods converge to 16 as the minimum value. So I think that's solid. The key idea is that by symmetry and applying Cauchy-Schwarz or AM-GM, we can show that the minimum is achieved when all variables are equal, leading to the product being 16.

**Final Answer**
The minimum value is \boxed{16}.
Therefore, the minimum value of the expression is $\boxed{16}$.
