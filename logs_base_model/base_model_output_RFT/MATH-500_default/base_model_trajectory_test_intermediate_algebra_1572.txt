Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, the question is about finding the value of 'a' that makes the function f(n) continuous. The function is piecewise defined: for n less than a, it's 4n + 3, and for n greater than or equal to a, it's 7n - 12. 

First, I remember that for a function to be continuous at a point, the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit at that point must be equal, and they must also equal the function's value at that point. In this case, the function changes its definition at n = a. So, the point of interest here is n = a. 

Therefore, I need to check the continuity at n = a. That means I need to compute the limit as n approaches a from the left (using the first part of the function) and the limit as n approaches a from the right (using the second part of the function), and set them equal to each other. Additionally, since the function is defined at n = a by the second part, the right-hand limit should equal f(a).

Let me write that out step by step.

First, the left-hand limit as n approaches a from below: since for n < a, the function is 4n + 3, the limit as n approaches a from the left is just 4a + 3. 

Second, the right-hand limit as n approaches a from above: for n >= a, the function is 7n - 12, so the limit as n approaches a from the right is 7a - 12. 

For the function to be continuous at n = a, these two limits must be equal. So, I set them equal to each other:

4a + 3 = 7a - 12

Now, I need to solve this equation for a. Let's do that step by step.

Subtract 4a from both sides:

3 = 3a - 12

Then, add 12 to both sides:

15 = 3a

Divide both sides by 3:

a = 5

Wait, so a is 5? Let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

If a is 5, then the left-hand limit is 4*5 + 3 = 20 + 3 = 23. The right-hand limit is 7*5 - 12 = 35 - 12 = 23. So, both sides equal 23, which is good. Therefore, the function is continuous at n = 5. 

But let me think again. The function is defined as 4n + 3 for n < a and 7n - 12 for n >= a. So, when a is 5, for n < 5, it's 4n + 3, and for n >= 5, it's 7n - 12. The point at n = 5 is included in the second part, so f(5) = 7*5 - 12 = 35 - 12 = 23, which matches the limit from the left. Therefore, yes, the function is continuous at a = 5.

Is there any other consideration I need to make here? For example, could there be a different value of a where the function is also continuous? Let's see. The equation 4a + 3 = 7a - 12 only has one solution, which is a = 5. So, that's the only value that makes the function continuous at n = a. Therefore, the answer should be 5.

Wait, but let me check if there's any possibility that the function could be continuous elsewhere. For example, if a is not 5, then the function might have a jump discontinuity at n = a. But since the question is asking for the value of a that makes the graph continuous, we only need to ensure continuity at the point where the function changes definition, which is n = a. So, the answer is indeed 5.

Another way to think about this is to graph both functions and see where they intersect. The left part is a straight line with slope 4 and y-intercept 3, and the right part is a straight line with slope 7 and y-intercept -12. The point where they intersect is the solution to 4a + 3 = 7a - 12, which is a = 5. So, at n = 5, both lines meet, making the function continuous there. 

Therefore, after checking all steps and verifying the solution, I can confidently say that the value of a that makes the function continuous is 5.
Therefore, the value of \( a \) that makes the graph of \( y = f(n) \) continuous is \(\boxed{5}\).
