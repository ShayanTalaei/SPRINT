Okay, so I need to convert the fraction 3/20 into a decimal. Hmm, let me think. I remember that fractions can be converted to decimals by dividing the numerator by the denominator. So in this case, I should divide 3 by 20. Let me try that.

First, I set up the division: 3 รท 20. Since 20 is larger than 3, I know the decimal will start with 0. Then, I can add a decimal point and some zeros to continue the division. Let me write that out:

20 ) 3.000

Now, how many times does 20 go into 30? Well, 20 times 1 is 20, and 20 times 2 is 40, which is too big. So it goes once. Multiply 20 by 1 to get 20, subtract that from 30, which leaves 10. Bring down the next 0 to make 100.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, after the first step, I had 3 divided by 20. I added a decimal point and a zero, making it 30. 20 goes into 30 once, so write down 1. Then subtract 20 from 30, which is 10. Then bring down the next 0, making it 100. Now, how many times does 20 go into 100? Exactly 5 times. So write down 5. Multiply 20 by 5 to get 100, subtract that from 100, and there's no remainder left.

So putting it all together, the division gives 0.15. Therefore, 3/20 as a decimal is 0.15. Let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 20 times 0.15 equals 3, right? 20 times 0.1 is 2, and 20 times 0.05 is 1, so 2 + 1 = 3. Yep, that checks out. So I think that's the correct answer.
