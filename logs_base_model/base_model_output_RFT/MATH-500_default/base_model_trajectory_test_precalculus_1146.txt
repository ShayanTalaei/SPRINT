Okay, so I need to find the constant d in the equation where sin^7 x is expressed as a combination of sine terms with coefficients a, b, c, d and arguments 7x, 5x, 3x, x respectively. The problem says this holds for all angles x, so I guess I need to use some trigonometric identities to expand sin^7 x into these sine terms. Hmm.

First, I remember that powers of sine can be expressed using multiple-angle formulas. Maybe I can use the identity for sin^n x, which often involves expanding it using complex exponentials or using recursive formulas. Since this is the 7th power, it might be a bit involved, but let's see.

Another approach is to use the identity for sin^7 x in terms of multiple angles. I recall that sin^7 x can be written using the expansion involving sin(7x), sin(5x), sin(3x), and sin x, which is exactly the form given in the problem. So maybe I need to use the expansion formula for sin^7 x.

Alternatively, I can use the exponential form of sine. Since sin x = (e^(ix) - e^(-ix))/2i, then sin^7 x would be [(e^(ix) - e^(-ix))/2i]^7. Expanding that using the binomial theorem might give me terms that can be converted back into sine functions. Let's try that.

Let me write sin x as (e^(ix) - e^(-ix))/(2i). Then sin^7 x is [(e^(ix) - e^(-ix))/(2i)]^7. Let's expand that using the binomial theorem. The binomial expansion of (a + b)^n is the sum from k=0 to n of (n choose k) a^(n-k) b^k. Here, a is e^(ix), b is -e^(-ix), and n is 7.

So sin^7 x = 1/(2i)^7 * sum_{k=0}^7 (7 choose k) (e^(ix))^(7 - k) (-e^(-ix))^k.

Simplify the exponents: (e^(ix))^(7 - k) = e^(i(7 - k)x) and (-e^(-ix))^k = (-1)^k e^(-ikx). So multiplying these gives (-1)^k e^(i(7 - k - k)x) = (-1)^k e^(i(7 - 2k)x).

Therefore, sin^7 x = 1/(2i)^7 * sum_{k=0}^7 (7 choose k) (-1)^k e^(i(7 - 2k)x).

Now, (2i)^7 = 2^7 * i^7 = 128 * (i^4 * i^3) = 128 * (1 * (-i)) = -128i. So 1/(2i)^7 = 1/(-128i) = i/128. Because 1/i = -i.

Therefore, sin^7 x = (i/128) * sum_{k=0}^7 (7 choose k) (-1)^k e^(i(7 - 2k)x).

Now, let's compute the sum term by term. Let's note that e^(iθ) can be expressed as cos θ + i sin θ. But since we are dealing with a sum of complex exponentials, when we take the imaginary part (since sin^7 x is a real function), the coefficients of e^(iθ) and e^(-iθ) will combine into sine terms.

Wait, but in our case, the sum is over k from 0 to 7, and each term is (7 choose k) (-1)^k e^(i(7 - 2k)x). Let's list out each term:

For k = 0:
(7 choose 0) (-1)^0 e^(i7x) = 1 * 1 * e^(i7x) = e^(i7x)

k = 1:
(7 choose 1) (-1)^1 e^(i5x) = 7 * (-1) * e^(i5x) = -7 e^(i5x)

k = 2:
(7 choose 2) (-1)^2 e^(i3x) = 21 * 1 * e^(i3x) = 21 e^(i3x)

k = 3:
(7 choose 3) (-1)^3 e^(ix) = 35 * (-1) * e^(ix) = -35 e^(ix)

k = 4:
(7 choose 4) (-1)^4 e^(i(-1)x) = 35 * 1 * e^(-ix) = 35 e^(-ix)

k = 5:
(7 choose 5) (-1)^5 e^(i(-3)x) = 21 * (-1) * e^(-i3x) = -21 e^(-i3x)

k = 6:
(7 choose 6) (-1)^6 e^(i(-5)x) = 7 * 1 * e^(-i5x) = 7 e^(-i5x)

k = 7:
(7 choose 7) (-1)^7 e^(i(-7)x) = 1 * (-1) * e^(-i7x) = -e^(-i7x)

So the sum is:

e^(i7x) -7 e^(i5x) +21 e^(i3x) -35 e^(ix) +35 e^(-ix) -21 e^(-i3x) +7 e^(-i5x) -e^(-i7x)

Now, grouping terms with exponentials and their conjugates:

- e^(i7x) - e^(-i7x) = -2i sin7x

7 e^(i5x) +7 e^(-i5x) = 14i sin5x? Wait, hold on:

Wait, let's group them:

For 7x: e^(i7x) - e^(-i7x) = 2i sin7x. But here it's e^(i7x) - e^(-i7x) multiplied by 1. Wait, no:

Wait, in the sum above, for k=0: e^(i7x), and k=7: -e^(-i7x). So the coefficient is 1 -1 = 0? Wait, no:

Wait, no. Let's look again:

From k=0: e^(i7x)

From k=7: -e^(-i7x)

So total for 7x: e^(i7x) - e^(-i7x) = 2i sin7x. But in our sum, these terms are multiplied by (i/128):

So the term for 7x: 2i sin7x multiplied by (i/128). Wait, but no:

Wait, the entire sum is multiplied by (i/128). So let's process each pair:

Group terms:

1. e^(i7x) - e^(-i7x): coefficient is 1 (from k=0) + (-1) (from k=7) = 0. Wait, no:

Wait, the sum has e^(i7x) from k=0, and -e^(-i7x) from k=7. So the total coefficient for e^(i7x) and e^(-i7x) is 1 -1 = 0. So they cancel out? Wait, that can't be. Wait, let's check:

Wait, the sum is:

e^(i7x) -7 e^(i5x) +21 e^(i3x) -35 e^(ix) +35 e^(-ix) -21 e^(-i3x) +7 e^(-i5x) -e^(-i7x)

So grouping:

- e^(i7x) - e^(-i7x) = -2i sin7x

-7 e^(i5x) +7 e^(-i5x) = -14i sin5x

21 e^(i3x) -21 e^(-i3x) = 42i sin3x

-35 e^(ix) +35 e^(-ix) = -70i sinx

So the total sum is:

-2i sin7x -14i sin5x +42i sin3x -70i sinx

Therefore, sin^7 x = (i/128) * [ -2i sin7x -14i sin5x +42i sin3x -70i sinx ]

Simplify this expression:

Multiply each term inside the brackets by i/128:

First term: (-2i sin7x) * (i/128) = (-2i^2 sin7x)/128 = (-2*(-1) sin7x)/128 = 2 sin7x /128 = sin7x /64

Second term: (-14i sin5x) * (i/128) = (-14i^2 sin5x)/128 = (-14*(-1) sin5x)/128 = 14 sin5x /128 = 7 sin5x /64

Third term: (42i sin3x) * (i/128) = 42i^2 sin3x /128 = 42*(-1) sin3x /128 = -42 sin3x /128 = -21 sin3x /64

Fourth term: (-70i sinx) * (i/128) = (-70i^2 sinx)/128 = (-70*(-1) sinx)/128 = 70 sinx /128 = 35 sinx /64

Therefore, combining all terms:

sin^7 x = (1/64) sin7x + (7/64) sin5x - (21/64) sin3x + (35/64) sinx

Comparing this with the given equation:

sin^7 x = a sin7x + b sin5x + c sin3x + d sinx

Therefore, the coefficients are:

a = 1/64

b = 7/64

c = -21/64

d = 35/64

So the question asks for d, which is 35/64.

Wait, but let me check the signs again. In the expansion, the coefficients after multiplying by i/128:

First term: 2 sin7x /128 = sin7x /64

Second term: 14 sin5x /128 = 7 sin5x /64

Third term: -42 sin3x /128 = -21 sin3x /64

Fourth term: 70 sinx /128 = 35 sinx /64

Yes, that seems correct.

Wait, but let me check again the step where I grouped the terms. The sum after grouping:

-2i sin7x -14i sin5x +42i sin3x -70i sinx

Multiplying each term by i/128:

-2i * i = -2i² = 2 (since i² = -1)

Similarly, -14i * i = -14i² = 14

42i * i = 42i² = -42

-70i * i = -70i² = 70

Therefore, each term becomes:

2 sin7x /128 = sin7x /64

14 sin5x /128 = 7 sin5x /64

-42 sin3x /128 = -21 sin3x /64

70 sinx /128 = 35 sinx /64

So yes, the coefficients are correct.

Therefore, d = 35/64.

But wait, just to make sure, maybe there's another way to compute this. For example, using orthogonality of sine functions.

Since the equation holds for all x, the coefficients of each sine term must be equal on both sides. Therefore, the coefficient of sin7x is a, sin5x is b, sin3x is c, and sinx is d. So by expanding sin^7 x in terms of multiple angles, we can find these coefficients.

Alternatively, another method is to use the identity for sin^n x in terms of multiple angles. For odd powers, there's a formula involving combinations. For example, sin^7 x can be expressed as a sum of sines with coefficients determined by certain combinations.

But since we already derived it using complex exponentials and the expansion, and the coefficient d is 35/64, which is 35 over 64. Hmm. Let me confirm once again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign of the coefficients when grouping. Let's check:

Original sum after expanding binomial:

sum_{k=0}^7 (7 choose k) (-1)^k e^(i(7 - 2k)x)

Then, grouping terms:

For 7x: k=0 gives e^(i7x), k=7 gives -e^(-i7x). So the coefficient for e^(i7x) is 1, and for e^(-i7x) is -1. When we take the imaginary part, we have e^(i7x) - e^(-i7x) = 2i sin7x. Then multiplied by (i/128):

2i sin7x * (i/128) = 2i^2 sin7x /128 = -2 sin7x /128 = -sin7x /64. Wait, but in the previous calculation, we had sin7x /64. Wait, this is conflicting.

Wait, hold on. Let's re-examine this step.

Earlier, I grouped the terms as:

- e^(i7x) - e^(-i7x) = -2i sin7x.

But when multiplying by (i/128):

(-2i sin7x) * (i/128) = (-2i * i) sin7x /128 = (2) sin7x /128 = sin7x /64.

But on the other hand, using the orthogonality approach, the coefficient of sin7x is a, which we found as 1/64. So that seems consistent.

But when I think in terms of the exponential terms, e^(i7x) - e^(-i7x) is 2i sin7x, and then multiplying by (i/128) gives (2i sin7x)(i/128) = 2i^2 sin7x /128 = -2 sin7x /128 = -sin7x /64. Wait, that contradicts the previous result.

Wait, so this discrepancy is concerning. Which one is correct?

Wait, in the initial expansion, after grouping the terms, we had:

-2i sin7x -14i sin5x +42i sin3x -70i sinx

Then, multiplying each term by (i/128):

First term: (-2i sin7x) * (i/128) = (-2i * i) sin7x /128 = (2) sin7x /128 = sin7x /64

Second term: (-14i sin5x) * (i/128) = (-14i * i) sin5x /128 = 14 sin5x /128 = 7 sin5x /64

Third term: (42i sin3x) * (i/128) = (42i * i) sin3x /128 = -42 sin3x /128 = -21 sin3x /64

Fourth term: (-70i sinx) * (i/128) = (-70i * i) sinx /128 = 70 sinx /128 = 35 sinx /64

So the coefficients are indeed 1/64, 7/64, -21/64, 35/64.

But when grouping the terms as e^(i7x) - e^(-i7x), which equals 2i sin7x, then multiplying by (i/128) gives (2i sin7x)(i/128) = -2 sin7x /128 = -sin7x /64, which is different.

Wait, so which is correct?

Wait, in the initial expansion, the coefficient for e^(i7x) is 1 (from k=0) and for e^(-i7x) is -1 (from k=7). So when we combine those terms, it's 1*e^(i7x) + (-1)*e^(-i7x) = e^(i7x) - e^(-i7x) = 2i sin7x. Then, multiplying by (i/128):

2i sin7x * (i/128) = 2i^2 sin7x /128 = 2*(-1) sin7x /128 = -2 sin7x /128 = -sin7x /64.

But according to the earlier term-by-term multiplication, we have sin7x /64. So there is a discrepancy here. That suggests an error in the process.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the initial step of expanding the binomial. Let's check that again.

Original expansion:

sin^7 x = [ (e^(ix) - e^(-ix) ) / (2i) ]^7

= 1/(2i)^7 * sum_{k=0}^7 (7 choose k) (e^(ix))^{7 -k} (-e^(-ix))^k

= 1/(2i)^7 * sum_{k=0}^7 (7 choose k) (-1)^k e^{i(7 - 2k)x}

Yes, that seems correct.

Then, 1/(2i)^7 = 1/( (-2)^7 i^7 ) = 1/( -128 * (-i) ) = 1/(128i) = -i/128. Wait, hold on, 1/(2i)^7 = (1/2)^7 * 1/i^7 = 1/(128) * 1/(i^7). Since i^4 = 1, i^7 = i^(4+3) = i^3 = -i. So 1/i^7 = 1/(-i) = -1/i = i. Therefore, 1/(2i)^7 = 1/(128) * i = i/128.

Wait, that's different from what I said before. Wait, so 1/(2i)^7 = (1/(2))^7 * 1/(i^7) = 1/128 * 1/(-i) = -1/(128i) = i/128. Because 1/i = -i. So 1/(-i) = i. Therefore, 1/(2i)^7 = i/128.

Therefore, sin^7 x = (i/128) * sum_{k=0}^7 (7 choose k) (-1)^k e^{i(7 - 2k)x}.

So that part is correct.

Then, when we compute the sum, the terms are:

For k=0: e^(i7x)

k=1: -7 e^(i5x)

k=2: 21 e^(i3x)

k=3: -35 e^(ix)

k=4: 35 e^(-ix)

k=5: -21 e^(-i3x)

k=6: 7 e^(-i5x)

k=7: -e^(-i7x)

So the sum is:

e^(i7x) -7 e^(i5x) +21 e^(i3x) -35 e^(ix) +35 e^(-ix) -21 e^(-i3x) +7 e^(-i5x) -e^(-i7x)

Now, group the terms:

e^(i7x) - e^(-i7x) = 2i sin7x

-7 e^(i5x) +7 e^(-i5x) = -14i sin5x

21 e^(i3x) -21 e^(-i3x) = 42i sin3x

-35 e^(ix) +35 e^(-ix) = -70i sinx

Therefore, the sum becomes:

2i sin7x -14i sin5x +42i sin3x -70i sinx

Then, multiplying by (i/128):

(2i sin7x -14i sin5x +42i sin3x -70i sinx) * (i/128)

= [2i * i sin7x -14i * i sin5x +42i * i sin3x -70i * i sinx] /128

= [2i² sin7x -14i² sin5x +42i² sin3x -70i² sinx] /128

= [2*(-1) sin7x -14*(-1) sin5x +42*(-1) sin3x -70*(-1) sinx] /128

= [-2 sin7x +14 sin5x -42 sin3x +70 sinx]/128

= (-2 sin7x)/128 +14 sin5x /128 -42 sin3x /128 +70 sinx /128

Simplify each term:

-2 sin7x /128 = -sin7x /64

14 sin5x /128 = 7 sin5x /64

-42 sin3x /128 = -21 sin3x /64

70 sinx /128 = 35 sinx /64

Therefore, sin^7 x = (-sin7x)/64 + (7 sin5x)/64 - (21 sin3x)/64 + (35 sinx)/64

So comparing to the given equation:

sin^7 x = a sin7x + b sin5x + c sin3x + d sinx

We can equate coefficients:

a = -1/64

b = 7/64

c = -21/64

d = 35/64

Wait, but earlier I thought d was 35/64, but according to this, it's 35/64. However, the first term is -sin7x /64, so a is -1/64. Then the coefficients for sin5x is 7/64, sin3x is -21/64, and sinx is 35/64. So d is 35/64. So the answer is 35/64.

But in the previous step-by-step, I had d as 35/64, which is correct.

Wait, but in the first calculation, when I considered the grouping of terms:

Grouping:

- e^(i7x) - e^(-i7x) = -2i sin7x

But according to the expansion, the sum is:

e^(i7x) -7 e^(i5x) +21 e^(i3x) -35 e^(ix) +35 e^(-ix) -21 e^(-i3x) +7 e^(-i5x) -e^(-i7x)

So the e^(i7x) - e^(-i7x) term is 2i sin7x, but when we multiplied by i/128, we get 2i sin7x * i/128 = -2 sin7x /128 = -sin7x /64, which is correct. Then the other terms are handled correctly. So the coefficient of sinx is 70/128 sinx = 35/64 sinx.

Therefore, the answer is indeed d = 35/64.

But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can use another method. For example, using the identity for sin^7 x. I recall that sin^n x can be expressed in terms of multiple angles using the formula involving the binomial coefficients and certain recursive relations. For example, sin^7 x can be written as a combination of sin7x, sin5x, sin3x, and sinx with coefficients derived from the binomial coefficients.

Alternatively, another approach is to use the identity that relates sin^7 x to a linear combination of multiple angles. Since we know that sin^n x can be expressed as a sum of sines with arguments kx for k odd from 1 to n, multiplied by coefficients. For n=7, we have terms with 7x, 5x, 3x, and x.

But in the expansion we did, we arrived at the coefficients as a = -1/64, b=7/64, c=-21/64, d=35/64.

Therefore, the answer is 35/64.

But just to confirm once more, let's consider x = π/2. Then sin x = 1, so sin^7 x = 1.

Compute the right-hand side: a sin7x + b sin5x + c sin3x + d sinx.

For x = π/2:

sin7x = sin(7π/2) = sin(3π + π/2) = -1

sin5x = sin(5π/2) = sin(2π + π/2) = 1

sin3x = sin(3π/2) = -1

sinx = sin(π/2) = 1

Therefore, RHS = a*(-1) + b*(1) + c*(-1) + d*(1)

Substituting the coefficients:

= (-1/64)*(-1) + (7/64)*(1) + (-21/64)*(-1) + (35/64)*(1)

= 1/64 + 7/64 + 21/64 + 35/64

= (1 + 7 + 21 + 35)/64

= 64/64 = 1

Which matches sin^7 x = 1. So this test case works.

Another test case: x = π/4. Then sin x = √2/2, so sin^7 x = (√2/2)^7 = (2^(1/2))^7 / 2^7 = 2^(7/2)/128 = 2^(3.5)/128 = (8 * √2)/128 = √2 / 16.

Compute RHS:

sin7x = sin(7π/4) = -√2/2

sin5x = sin(5π/4) = -√2/2

sin3x = sin(3π/4) = √2/2

sinx = sin(π/4) = √2/2

Therefore, RHS = a*(-√2/2) + b*(-√2/2) + c*(√2/2) + d*(√2/2)

Substitute coefficients:

= (-1/64)*(-√2/2) + (7/64)*(-√2/2) + (-21/64)*(√2/2) + (35/64)*(√2/2)

= (√2/128) - (7√2)/128 - (21√2)/128 + (35√2)/128

Combine terms:

[1 -7 -21 +35]√2 /128 = (8√2)/128 = √2 /16

Which matches sin^7 x. So this test case also works.

Therefore, the coefficients must be correct, and d = 35/64.
