Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, we have a monic polynomial P(x) of degree 3. Monic means the leading coefficient is 1, right? So, P(x) is a cubic polynomial with leading term x³. 

The problem states that when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder is R(x). Then, when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x). Also, we know that P(0) = 5. We need to find P(5).

First, let's recall that when dividing a polynomial by another polynomial, the remainder has a degree less than the divisor. Since (x - 1)(x - 4) is a quadratic polynomial, the remainder R(x) must be a linear polynomial. Similarly, when dividing by (x - 2)(x - 3), which is also quadratic, the remainder 2R(x) must also be linear. So, R(x) is of the form ax + b, and 2R(x) is 2ax + 2b. 

So, let's denote R(x) = ax + b. Then, 2R(x) = 2ax + 2b.

Now, since P(x) divided by (x - 1)(x - 4) gives remainder R(x), we can write:

P(x) = (x - 1)(x - 4)Q1(x) + R(x)

Similarly, when divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), we have:

P(x) = (x - 2)(x - 3)Q2(x) + 2R(x)

Given that P(x) is a cubic polynomial, Q1(x) and Q2(x) must be linear polynomials (since (x - 1)(x - 4) is quadratic and multiplied by a linear Q1(x) gives a cubic). Similarly, Q2(x) is linear.

But maybe instead of dealing with Q1 and Q2, we can use the Remainder Factor Theorem. Since when a polynomial is divided by (x - a)(x - b), the remainder can be found by plugging in x = a and x = b into the remainder. Wait, actually, the remainder when divided by (x - a)(x - b) is a linear polynomial, say R(x), so R(a) = P(a) and R(b) = P(b). Similarly, when divided by (x - c)(x - d), the remainder 2R(x) would satisfy 2R(c) = P(c) and 2R(d) = P(d). 

Therefore, we can set up equations based on these points. Let's note the points where we can evaluate P(x):

From the first division, dividing by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder R(x) must satisfy R(1) = P(1) and R(4) = P(4). Similarly, from the second division, dividing by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder 2R(x) must satisfy 2R(2) = P(2) and 2R(3) = P(3). 

So, let's write down these equations:

1. R(1) = P(1) = a*1 + b = a + b
2. R(4) = P(4) = a*4 + b = 4a + b
3. 2R(2) = P(2) = 2*(a*2 + b) = 4a + 2b
4. 2R(3) = P(3) = 2*(a*3 + b) = 6a + 2b

So, we have four equations here. But since P(x) is a cubic polynomial, and we know it's monic, maybe we can use another condition to find the coefficients. We also know that P(0) = 5. Let's write down the general form of P(x):

Since P(x) is monic cubic, P(x) = x³ + px² + qx + r. We know that P(0) = r = 5, so r = 5.

So, P(x) = x³ + px² + qx + 5.

Now, we can use the equations from the remainders to set up more equations. Let's first write the equations from the remainders:

From R(x) = ax + b:

1. R(1) = a + b = P(1) = 1³ + p*1² + q*1 + 5 = 1 + p + q + 5 = p + q + 6
2. R(4) = 4a + b = P(4) = 4³ + p*4² + q*4 + 5 = 64 + 16p + 4q + 5 = 16p + 4q + 69
3. 2R(2) = 2*(2a + b) = 4a + 2b = P(2) = 2³ + p*2² + q*2 + 5 = 8 + 4p + 2q + 5 = 4p + 2q + 13
4. 2R(3) = 2*(3a + b) = 6a + 2b = P(3) = 3³ + p*3² + q*3 + 5 = 27 + 9p + 3q + 5 = 9p + 3q + 32

So now, we have four equations:

Equation 1: a + b = p + q + 6

Equation 2: 4a + b = 16p + 4q + 69

Equation 3: 4a + 2b = 4p + 2q + 13

Equation 4: 6a + 2b = 9p + 3q + 32

Now, we have four equations with four unknowns: a, b, p, q. Let's try to solve these equations step by step.

First, let's subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:

Equation 2 - Equation 1: (4a + b) - (a + b) = (16p + 4q + 69) - (p + q + 6)

Simplify left side: 3a

Right side: 15p + 3q + 63

So, 3a = 15p + 3q + 63 => Divide both sides by 3: a = 5p + q + 21

Equation 5: a = 5p + q + 21

Now, let's look at Equation 3 and Equation 1. Let's subtract 2*Equation 1 from Equation 3:

Equation 3 - 2*Equation 1: (4a + 2b) - 2*(a + b) = (4p + 2q + 13) - 2*(p + q + 6)

Left side: 4a + 2b - 2a - 2b = 2a

Right side: 4p + 2q + 13 - 2p - 2q -12 = 2p + 1

So, 2a = 2p + 1 => a = p + 0.5

Equation 6: a = p + 0.5

Now, from Equation 5 and Equation 6, we can set them equal:

From Equation 5: a = 5p + q + 21

From Equation 6: a = p + 0.5

Therefore:

5p + q + 21 = p + 0.5 => 4p + q + 21 = 0.5 => 4p + q = -20.5

Equation 7: 4p + q = -20.5

Now, let's look at Equation 4 and Equation 3. Let's subtract Equation 3 from Equation 4:

Equation 4 - Equation 3: (6a + 2b) - (4a + 2b) = (9p + 3q + 32) - (4p + 2q + 13)

Left side: 2a

Right side: 5p + q + 19

So, 2a = 5p + q + 19

But from Equation 6: a = p + 0.5, so 2a = 2p + 1

Therefore:

2p + 1 = 5p + q + 19 => -3p - q = 18 => 3p + q = -18

Equation 8: 3p + q = -18

Now, we have two equations:

Equation 7: 4p + q = -20.5

Equation 8: 3p + q = -18

Subtract Equation 8 from Equation 7:

(4p + q) - (3p + q) = (-20.5) - (-18)

p = -2.5

So, p = -2.5

Plug p = -2.5 into Equation 8: 3*(-2.5) + q = -18 => -7.5 + q = -18 => q = -10.5

So, q = -10.5

Now, from Equation 6: a = p + 0.5 = -2.5 + 0.5 = -2

So, a = -2

Then, from Equation 1: a + b = p + q + 6 => -2 + b = (-2.5) + (-10.5) + 6 => -2 + b = -7 + 6 => -2 + b = -1 => b = 1

So, b = 1

So, now we have a = -2, b = 1, p = -2.5, q = -10.5

Therefore, R(x) = ax + b = -2x + 1

Let's check if this works with the equations.

Check Equation 2: 4a + b = 4*(-2) + 1 = -8 + 1 = -7

RHS of Equation 2: 16p + 4q + 69 = 16*(-2.5) + 4*(-10.5) + 69 = -40 -42 + 69 = -82 + 69 = -13

Wait, but -7 ≠ -13. That's a problem. Did I make a miscalculation?

Wait, let me check again.

Equation 2: 4a + b = 16p + 4q + 69

We have a = -2, b = 1, p = -2.5, q = -10.5

So, LHS: 4*(-2) + 1 = -8 + 1 = -7

RHS: 16*(-2.5) + 4*(-10.5) + 69 = -40 -42 + 69 = (-82) + 69 = -13

-7 ≠ -13. Hmm, that's a problem. So, my solution is inconsistent. That means I made a mistake somewhere.

Let's retrace the steps.

From the Equations:

Equation 1: a + b = p + q + 6

Equation 2: 4a + b = 16p + 4q + 69

Equation 3: 4a + 2b = 4p + 2q + 13

Equation 4: 6a + 2b = 9p + 3q + 32

Then, subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:

(4a + b) - (a + b) = 3a = 15p + 3q + 63 => a = 5p + q + 21. Equation 5.

Then, subtract 2*Equation 1 from Equation 3:

(4a + 2b) - 2*(a + b) = 2a = 2p + 1 => a = p + 0.5. Equation 6.

From Equations 5 and 6:

5p + q + 21 = p + 0.5 => 4p + q = -20.5. Equation 7.

From Equation 4 - Equation 3:

(6a + 2b) - (4a + 2b) = 2a = 5p + q + 19. Equation 9.

But from Equation 6: 2a = 2p + 1. Therefore, 2p + 1 = 5p + q + 19 => -3p - q = 18 => 3p + q = -18. Equation 8.

So, Equations 7 and 8:

7: 4p + q = -20.5

8: 3p + q = -18

Subtract 8 from 7: p = -2.5

Then, q = -18 - 3*(-2.5) = -18 + 7.5 = -10.5

Then, a = p + 0.5 = -2.5 + 0.5 = -2

Then, from Equation 1: a + b = p + q + 6 => -2 + b = (-2.5) + (-10.5) + 6 => -2 + b = -7 + 6 => -2 + b = -1 => b = 1

But then Equation 2: 4a + b = 4*(-2) + 1 = -8 + 1 = -7

RHS: 16p + 4q + 69 = 16*(-2.5) + 4*(-10.5) + 69 = -40 -42 + 69 = -82 + 69 = -13

-7 ≠ -13. So, this is inconsistent. That means our initial assumption is wrong. Maybe we have a mistake in setting up the equations.

Wait, let's check the original setup. We said that when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder is R(x). So, P(1) = R(1), P(4) = R(4). Similarly, when divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), remainder is 2R(x). So, P(2) = 2R(2), P(3) = 2R(3). That seems correct.

But maybe there's another approach. Let's think again.

Alternatively, since P(x) is a cubic polynomial, we can write it as P(x) = (x - 1)(x - 4)Q1(x) + R(x), where R(x) is linear. Then, when we divide by (x - 2)(x - 3), which is another quadratic, the remainder should be 2R(x). But since (x - 2)(x - 3) is another quadratic, the remainder when dividing by it must be of degree less than 2, so linear. Therefore, 2R(x) is linear, so R(x) is linear. So, our earlier setup is correct.

But the problem is that when we solved, we got an inconsistency. Maybe there's an error in the equations.

Wait, let's check Equation 2 again. When we do 4a + b, that's from P(4) = 4a + b. But let's compute P(4) again.

P(x) = x³ + px² + qx + 5

So, P(4) = 4³ + p*4² + q*4 + 5 = 64 + 16p + 4q + 5 = 16p + 4q + 69. That's correct.

Similarly, R(4) = a*4 + b. So, 4a + b = 16p + 4q + 69. Which is Equation 2. So that's correct.

But when we plugged in the values, we got inconsistency. So, maybe there's a mistake in the solving steps.

Let me try solving Equations 7 and 8 again.

Equation 7: 4p + q = -20.5

Equation 8: 3p + q = -18

Subtract Equation 8 from Equation 7:

(4p + q) - (3p + q) = (-20.5) - (-18)

p = -2.5

Then, q = -18 - 3*(-2.5) = -18 + 7.5 = -10.5

So, p = -2.5, q = -10.5

Then, a = p + 0.5 = -2.5 + 0.5 = -2

Then, from Equation 1: a + b = p + q + 6

-2 + b = (-2.5) + (-10.5) + 6 = -13 + 6 = -7

So, -2 + b = -7 => b = -5

Wait, hold on! Earlier, I thought that b was 1, but now I think:

Wait, Equation 1: a + b = p + q + 6

We have a = -2, p = -2.5, q = -10.5

So, RHS: (-2.5) + (-10.5) + 6 = (-13) + 6 = -7

Therefore, LHS: -2 + b = -7 => b = -5

Wait, so earlier I thought b was 1, but that was wrong. The correct value is b = -5.

Therefore, R(x) = ax + b = -2x -5

Wait, so let's check this again.

R(x) = -2x -5

Then, 2R(x) = -4x -10

So, let's compute P(2) and P(3):

P(2) = 2³ + p*2² + q*2 + 5 = 8 + 4p + 2q + 5 = 13 + 4p + 2q

Given p = -2.5, q = -10.5:

13 + 4*(-2.5) + 2*(-10.5) = 13 -10 -21 = -18

But 2R(2) = -4*2 -10 = -8 -10 = -18. So, that's correct.

Similarly, P(3) = 3³ + p*3² + q*3 + 5 = 27 + 9p + 3q +5 = 32 + 9p + 3q

With p = -2.5, q = -10.5:

32 + 9*(-2.5) + 3*(-10.5) = 32 -22.5 -31.5 = 32 -54 = -22

2R(3) = -4*3 -10 = -12 -10 = -22. Correct.

Now, check P(1):

P(1) = 1 + p + q +5 = 6 + p + q = 6 + (-2.5) + (-10.5) = 6 -13 = -7

R(1) = -2*1 -5 = -7. Correct.

Check P(4):

P(4) = 64 + 16p +4q +5 = 69 +16*(-2.5) +4*(-10.5) = 69 -40 -42 = -13

R(4) = -2*4 -5 = -8 -5 = -13. Correct.

So, previously, I must have miscalculated a and b. So, a = -2, b = -5. So, R(x) = -2x -5. Then, 2R(x) = -4x -10.

So, now, let's check if Equation 2 holds:

Equation 2: 4a + b = 16p +4q +69

Left side: 4*(-2) + (-5) = -8 -5 = -13

Right side: 16*(-2.5) +4*(-10.5) +69 = -40 -42 +69 = -82 +69 = -13. Correct.

So, now, all equations are consistent. Therefore, the correct values are:

a = -2, b = -5, p = -2.5, q = -10.5

Therefore, R(x) = -2x -5

So, now, the polynomial P(x) is:

P(x) = x³ + px² + qx + 5 = x³ -2.5x² -10.5x +5

But since we need to compute P(5), let's compute that.

Compute P(5):

5³ + (-2.5)*(5²) + (-10.5)*5 +5 = 125 -2.5*25 -52.5 +5

Compute each term:

5³ = 125

-2.5*25 = -62.5

-10.5*5 = -52.5

+5 = +5

So, total: 125 -62.5 -52.5 +5

Calculate step by step:

125 -62.5 = 62.5

62.5 -52.5 = 10

10 +5 = 15

So, P(5) = 15

Wait, that seems straightforward. Let's verify with the polynomial.

Alternatively, since we know the remainder when divided by (x -1)(x -4) is R(x) = -2x -5, and P(x) = (x -1)(x -4)Q1(x) + R(x). So, if we can compute P(5), maybe we can use another approach.

But let's check with the actual polynomial.

Compute P(5):

x³ -2.5x² -10.5x +5

At x=5:

5³ = 125

-2.5*(5²) = -2.5*25 = -62.5

-10.5*5 = -52.5

+5 = 5

Total: 125 -62.5 -52.5 +5

125 -62.5 = 62.5

62.5 -52.5 = 10

10 +5 = 15. So, P(5) =15.

Alternatively, since we know that P(5) can be found via the Remainder Theorem if we divide by (x -5), but we don't have that information. However, since we have the polynomial, we can compute it directly.

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to compute P(5) using the given remainders. Let's see.

We have P(x) = (x -1)(x -4)Q1(x) + R(x). If we evaluate at x=5, we get P(5) = (5 -1)(5 -4)Q1(5) + R(5) = 4*1*Q1(5) + R(5) = 4Q1(5) + R(5)

But we don't know Q1(5). However, maybe we can relate Q1(5) with other points. Alternatively, if we can find Q1(x), but since we already have P(x) expressed as x³ -2.5x² -10.5x +5, which is monic, we can confirm the coefficients.

Alternatively, let's check if P(x) is correctly constructed. Let's verify with another point. For example, check P(2):

P(2) = 8 -2.5*4 -10.5*2 +5 = 8 -10 -21 +5 = (8 +5) - (10 +21) = 13 -31 = -18

Which matches 2R(2) = -4*2 -10 = -18. Correct.

Similarly, P(3) = 27 -2.5*9 -10.5*3 +5 = 27 -22.5 -31.5 +5 = (27 +5) - (22.5 +31.5) = 32 -54 = -22

Which matches 2R(3) = -4*3 -10 = -12 -10 = -22. Correct.

So, the polynomial seems correct. Therefore, P(5) =15.

Therefore, the answer is 15. So, boxed, it's \boxed{15}

**Final Answer**
\boxed{15}
Thus, the final answer is $\boxed{15}$.
