Okay, let's try to solve this problem. So, we have a parallelogram with three given coordinates: (5, 3), (6, 8), (7, 4), and the fourth point is (x, y) where x is greater than 7. We need to find x + y. Hmm, right. Parallelograms have some properties that might help here. Let me recall.

First, in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel. Also, the diagonals bisect each other. That might be useful. So, maybe if I can find the midpoints of the diagonals and set them equal, that could help find the missing point. Let's think.

Let me list the given points again: (5,3), (6,8), (7,4). So, three points, and the fourth is (x, y). Since it's a parallelogram, the midpoint of the diagonals should be the same. But which diagonals? The diagonals of a parallelogram connect opposite vertices. So, there are two diagonals, each connecting a pair of opposite vertices.

So, if we consider the diagonals connecting (5,3) to (7,4) and (6,8) to (x,y), their midpoints should be the same. Alternatively, another pair of diagonals: maybe (5,3) to (6,8) and (7,4) to (x,y). Wait, but which one is correct?

Wait, actually, in a parallelogram, the diagonals are between two pairs of opposite vertices. So, if we have four points A, B, C, D, the diagonals are AC and BD. So, depending on how the points are connected, the diagonals can vary. So, which points are connected? Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of vectors. In a parallelogram, the vector from one vertex to another should be equal to the vector from another vertex to the fourth. For example, if we have points A, B, C, D in order, then vector AB should equal vector DC, and vector AD equals vector BC. So, depending on the order of the points, the vectors can be different.

But here, the order isn't given. So, we need to figure out the possible orders of the points to determine the fourth point. Since the fourth point is (x, y) with x > 7, maybe we can use the properties of the parallelogram to find it.

Alternatively, maybe using the midpoint approach. Let's try that. Suppose the diagonals are between (5,3) and (7,4), and between (6,8) and (x,y). Then the midpoint of (5,3) and (7,4) should be the same as the midpoint of (6,8) and (x,y).

Calculating the midpoint between (5,3) and (7,4): the midpoint formula is ((5+7)/2, (3+4)/2) = (12/2, 7/2) = (6, 3.5).

Then the midpoint between (6,8) and (x,y) should also be (6, 3.5). So, setting up the equations:

(6 + x)/2 = 6 --> 6 + x = 12 --> x = 6

(8 + y)/2 = 3.5 --> 8 + y = 7 --> y = -1

But wait, x is supposed to be greater than 7, but here x is 6. That's conflicting. So, maybe this is not the correct pair of diagonals.

Alternatively, maybe the diagonals are between (5,3) and (6,8), and between (7,4) and (x,y). Let's check that.

Midpoint of (5,3) and (6,8): ((5+6)/2, (3+8)/2) = (11/2, 11/2) = (5.5, 5.5)

Midpoint of (7,4) and (x,y): ((7 + x)/2, (4 + y)/2). Set equal to (5.5, 5.5):

(7 + x)/2 = 5.5 --> 7 + x = 11 --> x = 4

(4 + y)/2 = 5.5 --> 4 + y = 11 --> y = 7

Again, x = 4, which is less than 7, but the problem states x >7. So, this can't be the case either.

Hmm, so maybe the diagonals are between (5,3) and (x,y), and (6,8) and (7,4). Let's try that.

Midpoint of (5,3) and (x,y): ((5 + x)/2, (3 + y)/2)

Midpoint of (6,8) and (7,4): ((6 +7)/2, (8 +4)/2) = (13/2, 12/2) = (6.5, 6)

Setting the midpoints equal:

(5 + x)/2 = 6.5 --> 5 + x = 13 --> x = 8

(3 + y)/2 = 6 --> 3 + y = 12 --> y = 9

So, x =8 and y=9. Then x + y = 17. Since x=8>7, this satisfies the condition. Let's check if this makes sense.

So, the four points would be (5,3), (6,8), (7,4), (8,9). Let's see if this is a parallelogram.

Another way to verify is to check if the vectors between consecutive points are equal. Let's see.

From (5,3) to (6,8): vector is (1,5)

From (6,8) to (7,4): vector is (1,-4)

From (7,4) to (8,9): vector is (1,5)

From (8,9) to (5,3): vector is (-3,-6)

Wait, that doesn't seem consistent. Wait, the sides between (5,3) and (6,8) is (1,5), then (6,8) to (7,4) is (1,-4). The opposite side from (7,4) to (8,9) is (1,5), which matches the first vector. But the opposite side from (8,9) to (5,3) is (-3,-6), which is not equal to (6,8) to (7,4), which is (1,-4). Hmm, so that might not be a parallelogram. Wait, maybe my order is wrong.

Wait, maybe the order is different. Let me think. If the points are (5,3), (6,8), (7,4), (8,9), maybe the sides are (5,3)-(6,8), (6,8)-(7,4), (7,4)-(8,9), (8,9)-(5,3). But then the sides (5,3)-(6,8) and (7,4)-(8,9) are both (1,5), which is good. The sides (6,8)-(7,4) is (1,-4), and (8,9)-(5,3) is (-3,-6). Those are not equal. So, maybe this isn't a parallelogram. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, maybe the order is different. Maybe the points are connected as (5,3)-(7,4)-(6,8)-(8,9). Let me check.

From (5,3) to (7,4): vector (2,1)

From (7,4) to (6,8): vector (-1,4)

From (6,8) to (8,9): vector (2,1)

From (8,9) to (5,3): vector (-3,-6)

Again, the opposite sides are (2,1) and (2,1), but the other pair is (-1,4) and (-3,-6), which aren't equal. So, that's not a parallelogram either.

Wait, maybe the order is (5,3)-(6,8)-(8,9)-(7,4). Let's see.

From (5,3) to (6,8): (1,5)

From (6,8) to (8,9): (2,1)

From (8,9) to (7,4): (-1,-5)

From (7,4) to (5,3): (-2,-1)

Here, the opposite sides (1,5) and (-1,-5) are negatives of each other, and (2,1) and (-2,-1) are negatives. So, this is actually a parallelogram. Because in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal in magnitude and direction. Wait, but here they are negatives. Wait, no. Wait, in vectors, if you traverse the sides, the opposite sides would have the same vector. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, in a parallelogram, the vectors representing the sides should be equal. So, if we go from (5,3) to (6,8) is (1,5), then from (8,9) to (7,4) is (-1,-5), which is the negative vector. So, they are not equal. Hmm. So, that's a problem.

Wait, maybe the points are ordered differently. Let's try another order. Suppose the points are (5,3), (6,8), (8,9), (7,4). Let's check the sides.

From (5,3) to (6,8): (1,5)

From (6,8) to (8,9): (2,1)

From (8,9) to (7,4): (-1,-5)

From (7,4) to (5,3): (-2,-1)

So, again, opposite sides are (1,5) and (-1,-5), which are negatives, not equal. Similarly, (2,1) and (-2,-1). So, not equal. So, that's not a parallelogram.

Hmm, maybe my assumption is wrong. Wait, but when we used the midpoint method, we got a point (8,9) which satisfies the midpoint condition. But when checking the vectors, it's not forming a parallelogram. So, maybe the problem is in the order of the points?

Alternatively, perhaps the given points are not in order. Maybe the order is different. Let's think.

Wait, in a parallelogram, the order of the points matters. The consecutive points should be connected by sides. So, if we have three points, the fourth can be found in different ways depending on which three are considered as consecutive.

Wait, maybe the three given points are not all consecutive. Let's see. For example, maybe two of them are adjacent, and the third is opposite. Wait, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps using the property that in a parallelogram, the sum of vectors equals zero. Let me recall that.

In a parallelogram, if you consider vectors from a common vertex, then the sum of two adjacent vectors equals the diagonal. Wait, maybe not. Let me think. If the points are A, B, C, D, then vector AB + vector AD = vector AC. But maybe that's not helpful here.

Alternatively, the position vectors: if we have a parallelogram with vertices A, B, C, D, then the position vectors satisfy A + C = B + D. That is, the sum of the position vectors of opposite vertices are equal. So, if we have three points, we can use this to find the fourth.

So, if the three points are A, B, C, then D = A + C - B. But depending on which three are considered as opposite or adjacent, the formula changes.

Wait, let me clarify. If we have a parallelogram with vertices A, B, C, D in order, then the position vectors satisfy A + C = B + D. So, if we know three of the points, we can find the fourth. But the problem is that we don't know the order of the given points. So, which three are A, B, C, and which is D?

Since the fourth point is (x, y) with x >7, maybe we can try different combinations.

Case 1: Suppose the given points are A, B, C, and D is the missing one. Then A + C = B + D.

So, if we take A = (5,3), B = (6,8), C = (7,4), then D = A + C - B = (5 +7 -6, 3 +4 -8) = (6, -1). But x=6, which is less than 7, so this contradicts x >7. So, invalid.

Case 2: Suppose A = (5,3), B = (6,8), D = (7,4), then C = B + D - A = (6 +7 -5, 8 +4 -3) = (8, 9). So, C = (8,9). So, the fourth point is (8,9), which satisfies x=8 >7. So, this seems to be the correct one. Let me check.

So, in this case, the points are A=(5,3), B=(6,8), D=(7,4), and C=(8,9). Then, the parallelogram would have vertices A, B, C, D. Let's check the vectors.

Vector AB: (6-5, 8-3) = (1,5)

Vector BC: (8-6, 9-8) = (2,1)

Vector CD: (7-8, 4-9) = (-1,-5)

Vector DA: (5-7, 3-4) = (-2,-1)

Wait, so AB is (1,5), BC is (2,1), CD is (-1,-5), DA is (-2,-1). Hmm, so AB and CD are negatives of each other, and BC and DA are negatives of each other. So, actually, the opposite sides are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. Which is correct for a parallelogram. Because in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel, which would mean their vectors are equal. Wait, but here they are negatives. Wait, but in vector terms, if you traverse the sides in the same direction, the vectors would be equal. Wait, maybe I need to check the order again.

Wait, if the points are A, B, C, D in order, then vectors AB and DC should be equal. But here, DC would be from D to C, which is (8-7,9-4)=(1,5), which is same as AB. Similarly, vector BC is (2,1), and vector AD is (7-5,4-3)=(2,1). Wait, no. Wait, AD is from A to D: (7-5,4-3)=(2,1). So, BC is (2,1) and AD is (2,1). So, BC and AD are equal. So, that works. So, in this case, AB and DC are equal, and BC and AD are equal. So, this is a parallelogram.

So, the fourth point is (8,9), which gives x + y = 17. That seems to be the answer. But why did the midpoint method give me (6, -1) which was invalid, but this method gives (8,9) which is valid.

Wait, maybe the midpoint approach requires the diagonals to bisect each other, but depending on which two points are considered as the diagonal endpoints. In the first midpoint approach, I took (5,3)-(7,4) as a diagonal, and (6,8)-(x,y) as the other diagonal. But in reality, the diagonals might be (5,3)-(6,8) and (7,4)-(x,y), which would give a different result, but that gave x=4, y=7, which is invalid. However, the other diagonal approach gave (5,3)-(8,9) and (6,8)-(7,4), whose midpoints are (6.5, 6), which is the same as midpoint of (6,8)-(7,4). Wait, but in this case, the midpoint of (5,3)-(8,9) is ((5+8)/2, (3+9)/2) = (6.5, 6), which is the same as the midpoint of (6,8)-(7,4). So, that works. So, that's another way to look at it.

So, in this case, the diagonals are (5,3)-(8,9) and (6,8)-(7,4). Their midpoints are the same, which is (6.5,6). So, that's valid. So, the fourth point is (8,9), which gives x + y =17.

But then why did the vector approach with points A, B, D give the same result? Because in that case, the vectors AB and DC are equal, and vectors BC and AD are equal. So, that works.

So, seems like (8,9) is the correct point. Therefore, x + y is 17. Let me check once more with coordinates.

So, plotting the points approximately: (5,3), (6,8), (7,4), (8,9). Connecting (5,3) to (6,8) to (8,9) to (7,4) and back to (5,3). Let's see the vectors again:

From (5,3) to (6,8): right 1, up 5

From (6,8) to (8,9): right 2, up 1

From (8,9) to (7,4): left 1, down 5

From (7,4) to (5,3): left 2, down 1

Wait, so the opposite sides are (1,5) and (-1,-5), which are negatives. Similarly, (2,1) and (-2,-1). So, in terms of direction, they are opposite, but in terms of magnitude, they are equal. So, in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal in magnitude and direction. Wait, but here, the vectors are negatives. So, does that mean that the sides are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction? That still satisfies the condition of being equal vectors if we consider direction. Wait, no. Wait, in vector terms, if two vectors are negatives, they are not equal. So, perhaps this is not a parallelogram.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the vector analysis. Let me clarify. In a parallelogram, the vectors representing the sides should be equal. So, if we have points A, B, C, D in order, then vector AB should equal vector DC, and vector BC should equal vector AD.

In this case, vector AB is (1,5), vector DC is (8 -7, 9 -4) = (1,5). So, AB equals DC. Vector BC is (2,1), vector AD is (7 -5,4 -3) = (2,1). So, BC equals AD. Therefore, all opposite sides are equal vectors. So, even though the vectors are in different directions (AB is right and up, DC is left and up? Wait, no. Wait, AB is from A to B: (1,5). DC is from D to C: (1,5). So, both vectors are the same. Similarly, BC is from B to C: (2,1), and AD is from A to D: (2,1). So, same vectors. Therefore, yes, it is a parallelogram.

So, even though when I plotted the points, the directions seemed opposite, but in reality, the vectors are equal. So, maybe my initial plotting was confusing the direction. So, actually, the figure is a parallelogram. Therefore, (8,9) is indeed the correct fourth point.

Therefore, the answer is x + y = 8 + 9 =17.

**Final Answer**
The value of \(x + y\) is \boxed{17}.
Therefore, the value of $x + y$ is $\boxed{17}$.
