Okay, let's try to figure out how much more Pam pays than Susan for the show tickets. Hmm, so both Susan and Pam are buying tickets with different discounts. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's recall the original price of one ticket is $20. Susan buys 4 tickets with a 25% discount, and Pam buys 5 tickets with a 30% discount. The question is asking how many more dollars Pam pays than Susan. So, I need to calculate the total amount each of them pays and then find the difference between Pam's total and Susan's total.

Let me start with Susan. She has a 25% discount on each ticket. A 25% discount means she pays 75% of the original price, right? Because 100% - 25% = 75%. So, the price Susan pays per ticket is 75% of $20. Let me compute that. 25% of $20 is $5, so 20 - 5 = $15. Wait, that's 75% of 20. Yeah, 0.75 * 20 = $15. So each ticket is $15 for Susan. Since she buys 4 tickets, her total cost is 4 * $15. Let me calculate that: 4 * 15 = $60. So Susan pays $60 in total.

Now, Pam has a 30% discount. That means she pays 70% of the original price per ticket. So, 30% off means she pays 70% of $20. Let me compute that. 30% of $20 is $6, so $20 - $6 = $14. Alternatively, 0.7 * 20 = $14. So each ticket for Pam is $14. She buys 5 tickets, so her total cost is 5 * $14. Let me do that multiplication: 5 * 14 = $70. So Pam pays $70 in total.

Now, the question is how many more dollars Pam pays than Susan. So, subtract Susan's total from Pam's total: $70 - $60 = $10. So Pam pays $10 more than Susan.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to be sure. Susan's discount: 25% off on $20 is indeed $5, so $20 - $5 = $15 per ticket. 4 tickets: 4 * 15 = 60. That's correct. Pam's discount: 30% off is $6, so $14 per ticket. 5 tickets: 5 * 14 = 70. Then 70 - 60 = 10. Yeah, that seems right.

Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by calculating the total discount each person gets and subtracting from the original total? Let's try that.

Original total for Susan: 4 * $20 = $80. She gets a 25% discount on each ticket. So total discount is 25% of $80. Let's see: 25% of 80 is 0.25 * 80 = $20. So Susan pays $80 - $20 = $60. That matches what I had before.

For Pam: Original total for 5 tickets is 5 * 20 = $100. She gets a 30% discount, so total discount is 0.3 * 100 = $30. Therefore, Pam pays $100 - $30 = $70. Then, 70 - 60 = $10. Same result. Good, that confirms it.

Alternatively, maybe using percentages directly. Susan's total is 75% of 80, which is 0.75 * 80 = 60. Pam's total is 70% of 100, which is 0.7 * 100 = 70. Difference is 10. Yep, same answer.

So all methods lead to the same conclusion. Pam pays $10 more than Susan. I think that's solid. No mistakes detected in the calculations. The answer should be $10.
Final Answer

The final answer is \boxed{10}.
