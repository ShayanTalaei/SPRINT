Okay, let's tackle this problem: compute the sum of 1/cos²10°, 1/sin²20°, and 1/sin²40°. Hmm, trigonometric expressions with squared terms. I remember some identities and maybe some angle relationships here. Let me think step by step.

First, let me write down the expression again to make sure I have it right: 1/cos²10° + 1/sin²20° + 1/sin²40°. So, three terms, each with a reciprocal of a squared trigonometric function. I need to compute their sum. 

I recall that 1/cos²θ is equal to sec²θ, and 1/sin²θ is csc²θ. So maybe rewriting the terms in terms of secant and cosecant might help? Let me try that:

sec²10° + csc²20° + csc²40°.

Hmm, not sure if that helps immediately. But maybe there's a way to relate these angles. Let me check if there's a relationship between 10°, 20°, and 40°. Wait, 10°, 20°, 40° are all multiples of 10°, but not sure if that's directly useful. However, 20° is double 10°, and 40° is double 20°. Maybe there's a double angle identity involved here.

Also, I remember that csc²θ = 1 + cot²θ. Similarly, sec²θ = 1 + tan²θ. Maybe expressing them in terms of tangent or cotangent could be useful?

Let me try that. Let's rewrite each term:

sec²10° = 1 + tan²10°,

csc²20° = 1 + cot²20°,

csc²40° = 1 + cot²40°.

So substituting these into the original expression:

(1 + tan²10°) + (1 + cot²20°) + (1 + cot²40°) = 3 + tan²10° + cot²20° + cot²40°.

Hmm, so now the problem reduces to computing tan²10° + cot²20° + cot²40°. That might be a simpler expression to handle. Let me note that down.

Wait, but tan and cot are reciprocals. Specifically, cotθ = tan(90° - θ). So cot20° = tan70°, and cot40° = tan50°. Therefore, tan²10° + tan²70° + tan²50°. So the sum becomes 3 + tan²10° + tan²70° + tan²50°. 

Hmm, maybe there's a relationship between tan10°, tan50°, tan70°. Let me recall that tan50° is tan(90° - 40°) = cot40°, but that's similar to before. Wait, maybe using some identity for tanA + tanB + tanC where A + B + C = 180°, but 10° + 50° + 70° = 130°, which isn't 180°, so that might not apply. 

Alternatively, maybe using the identity for tan3θ. Let's see, tan3θ = (3tanθ - tan³θ)/(1 - 3tan²θ). But not sure if that's helpful here. Alternatively, maybe using the identity for tan(A)tan(B)tan(C) when A + B + C = 180°, but again, not sure if that applies here.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that 10°, 50°, 70° are related in some way. Let me check if 10°, 50°, 70° can form an arithmetic progression? 10°, 50°, 70°. The differences are 40° and 20°, so not an arithmetic progression. Alternatively, maybe some other relationship.

Alternatively, perhaps using the identity for tanθ + tan(60° - θ) + tan(60° + θ) = tan3θ. Let me check if that applies here. Wait, if θ = 10°, then 60° - θ = 50°, 60° + θ = 70°. So tan10° + tan50° + tan70° = tan30°. Wait, tan3θ when θ=10° is tan30°, which is 1/√3. Let me verify that identity.

Yes, the identity is that tanθ + tan(60° - θ) + tan(60° + θ) = tan3θ. So if θ=10°, then tan10° + tan50° + tan70° = tan30° = 1/√3 ≈ 0.577. But wait, in our case, we have tan²10° + tan²50° + tan²70°. So that's the squares. Hmm, not sure if that identity helps directly, but maybe there's a way to relate the squares.

Alternatively, maybe using the identity tan²θ = sec²θ - 1. So, tan²10° + tan²50° + tan²70° = (sec²10° - 1) + (sec²50° - 1) + (sec²70° - 1) = sec²10° + sec²50° + sec²70° - 3.

But then we end up with sec²10° + sec²50° + sec²70°. Hmm, but the original expression was 3 + tan²10° + tan²50° + tan²70°, which becomes 3 + (sec²10° + sec²50° + sec²70° - 3) = sec²10° + sec²50° + sec²70°. Wait, but that seems like we're going in circles. Because the original problem is 1/cos²10° + 1/sin²20° + 1/sin²40°, which we transformed into sec²10° + csc²20° + csc²40°, which became 3 + tan²10° + tan²50° + tan²70°, then that's equal to sec²10° + sec²50° + sec²70°. But that's not helpful unless we can compute sec²10° + sec²50° + sec²70° in another way. Maybe not the right approach.

Alternatively, maybe look for a different identity or approach. Let's think about the original terms again: 1/cos²10°, 1/sin²20°, 1/sin²40°. Let me write them as:

1/cos²10° = sec²10°,

1/sin²20° = csc²20°,

1/sin²40° = csc²40°.

Alternatively, maybe express all in terms of sine or cosine. Let's see:

sec²10° = 1 + tan²10°,

csc²20° = 1 + cot²20°,

csc²40° = 1 + cot²40°.

So adding these up: 3 + tan²10° + cot²20° + cot²40°. Wait, that's what I had before. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe use the identity that cotθ = tan(90° - θ). So cot20° = tan70°, cot40° = tan50°. Therefore, the sum becomes 3 + tan²10° + tan²50° + tan²70°. So same as before.

Alternatively, maybe use some product-to-sum formulas or sum-to-product identities. Let me recall that tanA + tanB = sin(A+B)/(cosA cosB). But here we have squares. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe use the identity tan²θ = (1 - cos2θ)/(1 + cos2θ). Let's try that.

So tan²10° = (1 - cos20°)/(1 + cos20°),

tan²50° = (1 - cos100°)/(1 + cos100°),

tan²70° = (1 - cos140°)/(1 + cos140°).

Therefore, sum = [ (1 - cos20°)/(1 + cos20°) ) + (1 - cos100°)/(1 + cos100°) + (1 - cos140°)/(1 + cos140°) ].

Hmm, that might be complicated, but let's compute each term:

First term: (1 - cos20°)/(1 + cos20°). Let's compute this. Let me note that 1 - cosθ = 2sin²(θ/2) and 1 + cosθ = 2cos²(θ/2). Therefore, (1 - cosθ)/(1 + cosθ) = tan²(θ/2). Therefore, the first term is tan²10°, which is consistent. Similarly, the second term would be tan²50°, and the third tan²70°, so this just brings us back to where we were.

So perhaps that approach isn't helpful. Let's think differently.

Alternatively, maybe use the identity for cotA + cotB + cotC when A + B + C = 180°, but in our case, 10° + 50° + 70° = 130°, which is not 180°, so that identity doesn't apply here. But maybe if we can find some relationship.

Alternatively, maybe consider that 10°, 50°, 70° are angles in a triangle? Wait, 10° + 50° + 70° = 130°, so no. Alternatively, maybe 10°, 50°, 70°, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using complementary angles. For example, 70° is complementary to 20°, 50° complementary to 40°, but not sure.

Alternatively, maybe using sum formulas for tan. For example, tan(A + B + C). But that might be complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps expressing tan²10° + tan²50° + tan²70° in terms of sin and cos, and see if there's a simplification.

Wait, tan²θ = sin²θ / cos²θ. So tan²10° + tan²50° + tan²70° = (sin²10°/cos²10°) + (sin²50°/cos²50°) + (sin²70°/cos²70°). Let's see if that can be combined.

Alternatively, maybe using the identity sin²θ = 1 - cos²θ. So tan²θ = (1 - cos²θ)/cos²θ = (1/cos²θ) - 1. Therefore, tan²10° + tan²50° + tan²70° = (sec²10° - 1) + (sec²50° - 1) + (sec²70° - 1) = (sec²10° + sec²50° + sec²70°) - 3. Which again brings us back to the previous expression.

So, original sum is 3 + tan²10° + tan²50° + tan²70° = 3 + (sec²10° + sec²50° + sec²70° - 3) = sec²10° + sec²50° + sec²70°. So we need to compute sec²10° + sec²50° + sec²70°.

Hmm, maybe there's a relationship between these secant terms. Let me recall that sec²θ = 1 + tan²θ, but that might not help. Alternatively, maybe using the identity for sec²θ in terms of cos2θ. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe using the identity for sec²θ in terms of double angles. Let's recall that 1 + tan²θ = sec²θ, and 1 - tan²θ = 1/(cos2θ). Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe use the identity for cos(A)cos(B)cos(C). Wait, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps use the identity that sec²θ = 1 + tan²θ, and then try to find some relation between tan10°, tan50°, tan70°. Let me check if there's a relationship between these angles. Since 10°, 50°, 70°, maybe they form some kind of progression or have some sum identity.

Alternatively, perhaps using the identity that tanθ tan(60° - θ) tan(60° + θ) = tan3θ. Let me check that. For θ=10°, tan10° tan50° tan70° = tan30°, which is 1/√3. So that's equal to tan30°. So tan10° tan50° tan70° = 1/√3. Interesting. So maybe that can be used.

But we have tan²10° + tan²50° + tan²70°, and their product is 1/√3. Maybe if we can find tan²10° + tan²50° + tan²70° in terms of their product. Let me think.

Let me denote a = tan10°, b = tan50°, c = tan70°. Then we know that abc = 1/√3. Maybe we can find a² + b² + c² in terms of ab + bc + ca or something. Let me recall that (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca). But we don't know a + b + c. Alternatively, maybe using the identity a² + b² + c² = (a + b + c)² - 2(ab + bc + ca). But again, not helpful unless we can find a + b + c or ab + bc + ca.

Alternatively, maybe using the identity tanA + tanB + tanC = tanA tanB tanC if A + B + C = 180°. Wait, in our case, 10° + 50° + 70° = 130°, so not 180°, so that identity doesn't apply. But if we had angles summing to 180°, then tanA + tanB + tanC = tanA tanB tanC. So not helpful here.

Alternatively, maybe considering that 50° = 60° - 10°, and 70° = 60° + 10°, so maybe using some multiple-angle identities. Let me try that.

Let me recall that tan(60° + θ) = (tan60° + tanθ)/(1 - tan60° tanθ), and tan(60° - θ) = (tan60° - tanθ)/(1 + tan60° tanθ). Let me compute tan50° and tan70° in terms of tan10°.

tan50° = tan(60° - 10°) = (tan60° - tan10°)/(1 + tan60° tan10°). Similarly, tan70° = tan(60° + 10°) = (tan60° + tan10°)/(1 - tan60° tan10°).

Given that tan60° = √3, let's compute tan50° and tan70° in terms of a = tan10°.

So,

tan50° = (√3 - a)/(1 + √3 a),

tan70° = (√3 + a)/(1 - √3 a).

Therefore, tan²50° = [(√3 - a)/(1 + √3 a)]²,

tan²70° = [(√3 + a)/(1 - √3 a)]².

Hmm, so if I can compute tan²50° + tan²70° in terms of a, maybe something simplifies.

Let me compute tan²50° + tan²70°:

= [(√3 - a)²/(1 + √3 a)²] + [(√3 + a)²/(1 - √3 a)²]

This looks complicated, but let's expand the numerators and denominators.

First, let's compute (√3 - a)² = 3 - 2√3 a + a²,

(√3 + a)² = 3 + 2√3 a + a²,

Denominator for tan²50°: (1 + √3 a)² = 1 + 2√3 a + 3a²,

Denominator for tan²70°: (1 - √3 a)² = 1 - 2√3 a + 3a².

So,

tan²50° + tan²70° = [ (3 - 2√3 a + a²) / (1 + 2√3 a + 3a²) ] + [ (3 + 2√3 a + a²) / (1 - 2√3 a + 3a²) ]

Let me denote the first fraction as F and the second as G.

F = (3 - 2√3 a + a²)/(1 + 2√3 a + 3a²),

G = (3 + 2√3 a + a²)/(1 - 2√3 a + 3a²).

Let me compute F + G:

= [ (3 - 2√3 a + a²)(1 - 2√3 a + 3a²) + (3 + 2√3 a + a²)(1 + 2√3 a + 3a²) ] / [ (1 + 2√3 a + 3a²)(1 - 2√3 a + 3a²) ]

This is going to be a bit messy, but let's compute the numerator and denominator step by step.

First, compute the denominator:

Denominator = (1 + 2√3 a + 3a²)(1 - 2√3 a + 3a²)

This is of the form (A + B)(A - B) = A² - B², where A = 1 + 3a², B = 2√3 a.

Therefore, denominator = (1 + 3a²)² - (2√3 a)² = (1 + 6a² + 9a⁴) - (12a²) = 1 - 6a² + 9a⁴.

Now compute the numerator:

First term: (3 - 2√3 a + a²)(1 - 2√3 a + 3a²)

Multiply term by term:

3*1 = 3,

3*(-2√3 a) = -6√3 a,

3*3a² = 9a²,

(-2√3 a)*1 = -2√3 a,

(-2√3 a)*(-2√3 a) = (4*3)a² = 12a²,

(-2√3 a)*3a² = -6√3 a³,

a²*1 = a²,

a²*(-2√3 a) = -2√3 a³,

a²*3a² = 3a⁴.

Combine like terms:

Constant term: 3,

a terms: -6√3 a -2√3 a = -8√3 a,

a² terms: 9a² + 12a² + a² = 22a²,

a³ terms: -6√3 a³ -2√3 a³ = -8√3 a³,

a⁴ terms: 3a⁴.

So first term is 3 - 8√3 a + 22a² - 8√3 a³ + 3a⁴.

Second term: (3 + 2√3 a + a²)(1 + 2√3 a + 3a²)

Similarly, multiply term by term:

3*1 = 3,

3*2√3 a = 6√3 a,

3*3a² = 9a²,

2√3 a*1 = 2√3 a,

2√3 a*2√3 a = 12a²,

2√3 a*3a² = 6√3 a³,

a²*1 = a²,

a²*2√3 a = 2√3 a³,

a²*3a² = 3a⁴.

Combine like terms:

Constant term: 3,

a terms: 6√3 a + 2√3 a = 8√3 a,

a² terms: 9a² + 12a² + a² = 22a²,

a³ terms: 6√3 a³ + 2√3 a³ = 8√3 a³,

a⁴ terms: 3a⁴.

So second term is 3 + 8√3 a + 22a² + 8√3 a³ + 3a⁴.

Now add the two terms together:

First term: 3 - 8√3 a + 22a² - 8√3 a³ + 3a⁴,

Second term: 3 + 8√3 a + 22a² + 8√3 a³ + 3a⁴,

Adding them:

3 + 3 = 6,

-8√3 a + 8√3 a = 0,

22a² + 22a² = 44a²,

-8√3 a³ + 8√3 a³ = 0,

3a⁴ + 3a⁴ = 6a⁴.

Therefore, numerator = 6 + 44a² + 6a⁴.

So F + G = (6 + 44a² + 6a⁴)/(1 - 6a² + 9a⁴).

Therefore, tan²50° + tan²70° = (6 + 44a² + 6a⁴)/(1 - 6a² + 9a⁴), where a = tan10°.

Therefore, the total sum we need is:

3 + tan²10° + tan²50° + tan²70° = 3 + a² + (6 + 44a² + 6a⁴)/(1 - 6a² + 9a⁴).

Let me compute this:

= 3 + a² + [6 + 44a² + 6a⁴]/[1 - 6a² + 9a⁴].

Let me combine these terms. To add them, I need a common denominator. Let's denote D = 1 - 6a² + 9a⁴.

So,

= [3D + a² D + 6 + 44a² + 6a⁴]/D.

Compute numerator:

3D + a² D + 6 + 44a² + 6a⁴

First, expand 3D and a² D:

3D = 3(1 - 6a² + 9a⁴) = 3 - 18a² + 27a⁴,

a² D = a²(1 - 6a² + 9a⁴) = a² - 6a⁴ + 9a⁶.

Therefore, adding all terms:

3 - 18a² + 27a⁴ + a² - 6a⁴ + 9a⁶ + 6 + 44a² + 6a⁴.

Combine like terms:

Constants: 3 + 6 = 9,

a² terms: -18a² + a² + 44a² = 27a²,

a⁴ terms: 27a⁴ -6a⁴ +6a⁴ = 27a⁴,

a⁶ terms: 9a⁶.

So numerator = 9 + 27a² + 27a⁴ + 9a⁶.

Factor numerator:

= 9(1 + 3a² + 3a⁴ + a⁶).

Notice that 1 + 3a² + 3a⁴ + a⁶ = (1 + a²)^3. Let me check:

(1 + a²)^3 = 1 + 3a² + 3a⁴ + a⁶. Yes, exactly. So numerator = 9(1 + a²)^3.

Denominator D = 1 - 6a² + 9a⁴.

Wait, 1 - 6a² + 9a⁴ can be written as (3a² - 1)^2. Let me check:

(3a² - 1)^2 = 9a⁴ - 6a² + 1. Yes, exactly. So denominator = (3a² - 1)^2.

Therefore, the total sum is:

[9(1 + a²)^3]/[(3a² - 1)^2].

Therefore, the original sum is equal to [9(1 + a²)^3]/[(3a² - 1)^2], where a = tan10°.

So now, we need to compute this expression. Let's see if we can simplify it further.

First, note that a = tan10°, so a² = tan²10°. Let me compute 1 + a² = 1 + tan²10° = sec²10°. So 1 + a² = sec²10°, so (1 + a²)^3 = sec^6 10°. Similarly, denominator is (3a² - 1)^2 = (3 tan²10° - 1)^2.

But 3 tan²10° - 1 = 3 tan²10° - 1. Let me see if that relates to anything. Alternatively, maybe express in terms of cos20° or something.

Alternatively, recall that tan10° is a specific value. Maybe we can compute tan10° numerically and then compute this expression. But since the problem expects an exact answer, perhaps there's a way to express this in terms of known angles or simplify further.

Alternatively, note that 10°, 20°, 40°, 80°, etc., are related to regular polygons, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps use the identity that relates tan10° to some other expression. Let me recall that tan3θ = (3tanθ - tan³θ)/(1 - 3tan²θ). Let me set θ=10°, then tan30° = (3tan10° - tan³10°)/(1 - 3tan²10°). But tan30° = 1/√3.

So,

1/√3 = (3a - a³)/(1 - 3a²), where a = tan10°.

Multiply both sides by (1 - 3a²):

(1 - 3a²)/√3 = 3a - a³.

Multiply both sides by √3:

1 - 3a² = 3a√3 - a³√3.

Rearranged:

a³√3 - 3a² - 3a√3 + 1 = 0.

Hmm, this gives a cubic equation in a. Not sure if helpful here, but perhaps we can use this to find some relationship.

Alternatively, perhaps express 3a² - 1 in terms of something. From the equation above, let's solve for 3a²:

From 1/√3 = (3a - a³)/(1 - 3a²),

Multiply both sides by (1 - 3a²):

(1 - 3a²)/√3 = 3a - a³,

Multiply both sides by √3:

1 - 3a² = 3a√3 - a³√3,

Bring all terms to left-hand side:

a³√3 - 3a² - 3a√3 + 1 = 0.

Wait, this is the same as above. So perhaps we can factor this cubic equation. Let me try to factor it.

Let me write it as √3 a³ - 3a² - 3√3 a + 1 = 0.

Let me try possible rational roots. Using Rational Root Theorem, possible roots are ±1, ±1/√3, etc. Let me test a = 1:

√3(1) - 3(1) - 3√3(1) + 1 = √3 - 3 - 3√3 + 1 = (-2√3 - 2). Not zero.

a = -1:

-√3 - 3 + 3√3 + 1 = (2√3 - 2). Not zero.

a = 1/√3:

√3*(1/√3)^3 - 3*(1/√3)^2 - 3√3*(1/√3) + 1.

Compute each term:

√3*(1/(3√3)) = √3/(3√3) = 1/3,

-3*(1/3) = -1,

-3√3*(1/√3) = -3,

+1.

Total: 1/3 -1 -3 +1 = (1/3 -3) + (-1 +1) = (-8/3) + 0 = -8/3 ≠ 0.

a = -1/√3:

√3*(-1/√3)^3 - 3*(-1/√3)^2 - 3√3*(-1/√3) +1.

Compute each term:

√3*(-1/(3√3)) = -√3/(3√3) = -1/3,

-3*(1/3) = -1,

-3√3*(-1/√3) = 3,

+1.

Total: -1/3 -1 +3 +1 = (-4/3) +4 = 8/3 ≠ 0.

So no rational roots. Therefore, perhaps it's not factorable easily. Therefore, this approach might not help.

Alternatively, maybe use the identity that relates 3a² -1 to something. Let me recall that in the denominator, we have (3a² -1)^2. Let me compute 3a² -1. From the equation above:

From tan30° = 1/√3 = (3a -a³)/(1 -3a²),

Multiply both sides by √3(1 -3a²):

1 -3a² = 3a√3 -a³√3,

So 3a² = 1 -3a√3 +a³√3,

Therefore, 3a² -1 = -3a√3 +a³√3,

= √3(a³ -3a).

Therefore, 3a² -1 = √3 a(a² -3).

Therefore, denominator D = (3a² -1)^2 = 3a²(a² -3)^2.

So, going back to the expression [9(1 + a²)^3]/[(3a² -1)^2] = [9(1 + a²)^3]/[3a²(a² -3)^2] = [3(1 + a²)^3]/[a²(a² -3)^2].

Hmm, but not sure if this helps. Let me see:

Wait, a = tan10°, so a² = tan²10°, and 1 + a² = sec²10°, which is 1/cos²10°, and a² -3 = tan²10° -3. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe express in terms of sin and cos. Let me try:

a = tan10° = sin10°/cos10°, so a² = sin²10°/cos²10°.

Therefore, 1 + a² = 1 + sin²10°/cos²10° = (cos²10° + sin²10°)/cos²10° = 1/cos²10°.

Similarly, 3a² -1 = 3 sin²10°/cos²10° -1 = (3 sin²10° - cos²10°)/cos²10°.

Therefore, (3a² -1)^2 = (3 sin²10° - cos²10°)^2 / cos⁴10°.

Therefore, the entire expression becomes:

[9(1/cos²10°)^3] / [ (3 sin²10° - cos²10°)^2 / cos⁴10° ] =

9 / cos⁶10° * cos⁴10° / (3 sin²10° - cos²10°)^2 =

9 / [cos²10° (3 sin²10° - cos²10°)^2].

Hmm, not helpful. Alternatively, express 3 sin²10° - cos²10° in terms of double angles.

3 sin²10° - cos²10° = 3 sin²10° - cos²10° = 2 sin²10° + sin²10° - cos²10° = 2 sin²10° + (sin²10° - cos²10°) = 2 sin²10° - cos20°.

Since sin²θ - cos²θ = -cos2θ. So sin²10° - cos²10° = -cos20°. Therefore,

3 sin²10° - cos²10° = 2 sin²10° - cos20°.

But 2 sin²10° = 1 - cos20°, so:

= (1 - cos20°) - cos20° = 1 - 2cos20°.

Therefore, 3 sin²10° - cos²10° = 1 - 2cos20°.

Therefore, the denominator becomes (1 - 2cos20°)^2.

Therefore, the expression is:

9 / [cos²10° (1 - 2cos20°)^2].

Now, let's compute cos20°. Let me see if there's a relationship between 10°, 20°, and 40°. For instance, 20° is 2*10°, so maybe use double angle formulas.

cos20° = 1 - 2 sin²10°, or 2 cos²10° -1. Let's use cos20° = 2 cos²10° -1. Therefore,

1 - 2cos20° = 1 - 2(2 cos²10° -1) = 1 -4 cos²10° +2 = 3 -4 cos²10°.

Therefore, (1 - 2cos20°)^2 = (3 -4 cos²10°)^2.

Therefore, the expression becomes:

9 / [cos²10° (3 -4 cos²10°)^2].

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a different approach. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe use the original expression:

[9(1 + a²)^3]/[(3a² -1)^2] where a = tan10°.

Let me compute this numerically to see if there's a pattern. Maybe it's a perfect square or a known value.

But since we need an exact answer, maybe it's an integer. Let me check for possible values.

Let me recall that 10°, 20°, 40° are angles related to 30°, which is a common angle. Maybe the sum simplifies to 18?

Wait, 1/cos²10° + 1/sin²20° + 1/sin²40°. Let me compute each term approximately.

Compute cos10° ≈ 0.9848, so 1/cos²10° ≈ 1/(0.9698) ≈ 1.031.

sin20° ≈ 0.3420, so 1/sin²20° ≈ 1/(0.11696) ≈ 8.55.

sin40° ≈ 0.6428, so 1/sin²40° ≈ 1/(0.4132) ≈ 2.42.

Adding them up: 1.031 + 8.55 + 2.42 ≈ 12.0. Hmm, approximately 12. So maybe the exact value is 12. Let me check with more accurate calculations.

Compute cos10° ≈ 0.984807753012208,

1/cos²10° ≈ 1/(0.984807753012208²) ≈ 1/0.9698125716725 ≈ 1.031026.

sin20° ≈ 0.3420201433, so 1/sin²20° ≈ 1/(0.3420201433²) ≈ 1/0.1169777784 ≈ 8.544.

sin40° ≈ 0.6427876097, so 1/sin²40° ≈ 1/(0.6427876097²) ≈ 1/0.4131759112 ≈ 2.422.

Adding them: 1.031026 + 8.544 + 2.422 ≈ 12.0. Wow, exactly 12.0. So the sum is 12. Therefore, the exact answer is 12.

Therefore, the value of the given expression is 12. So in the required format, it's \boxed{12}.
