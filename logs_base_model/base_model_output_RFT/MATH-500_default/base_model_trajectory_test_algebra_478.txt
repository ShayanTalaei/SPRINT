Okay, so I need to find the volume of a cone. The formula given is V = (1/3)Bh, where B is the area of the base and h is the height. Alright, let's start by understanding what each part means. The base area is given as 30 square units, and the height is 6.5 units. 

First, let me make sure I remember the formula correctly. The volume of a cone is one-third of the product of the base area and the height. That makes sense because a cone is like a pyramid with a circular base, and the volume formula for pyramids is (1/3)Base Area Ã— height. So cones follow a similar principle. 

Now, let's plug in the numbers. The base area B is 30, and the height h is 6.5. So substituting these into the formula gives V = (1/3) * 30 * 6.5. Let me compute that step by step. 

First, multiply 30 and 6.5. Let's see, 30 times 6 is 180, and 30 times 0.5 is 15. Adding those together, 180 + 15 equals 195. So 30 * 6.5 = 195. 

Now, take that result and multiply by (1/3). So 195 divided by 3. Let me do that division. 3 goes into 195 how many times? 3 times 60 is 180, so subtracting 180 from 195 leaves 15. Then 3 goes into 15 five times. So total is 60 + 5 = 65. 

Wait, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check my calculations to be sure. 

Alternatively, I can compute 30 * 6.5 first. 30 times 6 is 180, and 30 times 0.5 is 15. Adding gives 195. Then 195 divided by 3 is indeed 65. 

Another way to think about it: 30 divided by 3 is 10, and then 10 multiplied by 6.5 is 65. That's another way to break it down. So both methods give the same result. 

So the volume should be 65 cubic units. Let me just confirm once more. The formula is correct, substitutions are correct, arithmetic seems right. 

I think that's all. No complicated steps here. The answer is 65.
Therefore, the volume of the cone is $\boxed{65}$ cubic units.
