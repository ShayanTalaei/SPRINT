Okay, so I need to figure out the minimum possible value of the expression 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6 by adding parentheses without changing the order of the terms. Let me start by understanding the problem better.

First, the original expression is 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6, which equals 13. The task is to add parentheses in different places to make the value as small as possible. Parentheses can group operations, changing the order in which additions and subtractions are performed. Since we can't rearrange the terms, only group them, I need to find the right groupings to maximize the negative impact or minimize the total.

Let me recall that parentheses can affect the order of operations by forcing certain parts to be calculated first. For example, if I group a subtraction with the following terms, like 4 + 5, then subtract that sum. Similarly, grouping a positive sum before a subtraction can change the result.

The original expression without parentheses is 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6. Let me break it down term by term:

1 + 2 = 3

3 + 3 = 6

6 - 4 = 2

2 + 5 = 7

7 + 6 = 13

So, the value is 13. To minimize this, I need to create as many large negative numbers as possible, or perhaps subtract larger sums. Let me consider different ways to place parentheses.

First, let's look at the operations. The expression has three additions and three subtractions. The subtractions are between 3 and 4, and between 4 and 5. Wait, actually, the original expression is 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6. So the subtractions are after the first three terms (after 3), and then after the 4th term (after 4). Wait, let's parse the expression correctly:

Starting from the left:

1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6.

So, the operations are:

+2, +3, -4, +5, +6.

So, the subtractions happen only once, after the third term, and then again after the fourth term. So, the structure is:

1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6.

So, the subtraction affects the 4th term. But if we can group terms with parentheses, we can change which terms are subtracted from which.

For example, if we group 4 with the following terms, like (4 + 5 + 6), then the expression becomes:

1 + 2 + 3 - (4 + 5 + 6) = 6 - 15 = -9. That seems pretty low. Wait, is that allowed? Let me check the problem statement again. It says we can add parentheses, but we cannot rearrange the order of the terms. So, the terms must remain in the original order, but we can group them. So grouping (4 + 5 + 6) is allowed because the order of the terms isn't changed, just grouped. So that would be 1 + 2 + 3 - (4 + 5 + 6) = 6 - 15 = -9. That's a possible value. But is that the minimum?

Wait, but maybe there's an even smaller value. Let's explore other groupings.

Alternatively, if we group the first subtraction with more terms. For example, 1 + 2 - 3 - 4 + 5 + 6. But that's not grouping with parentheses. Wait, parentheses can only group operations, so if we want to change the order, we need to enclose the terms we want to be evaluated first.

Wait, let's consider different groupings. Let's try to make as many subtractions as possible, especially of larger numbers.

One approach is to maximize the negative terms. Since subtraction is involved, if we can make the subtrahend as large as possible, that would reduce the total.

So, for instance, if we can have 1 + 2 + 3 - (4 + 5 + 6), that would be 6 - 15 = -9. But maybe even grouping more terms with the subtraction.

Alternatively, what if we group 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6 as 1 + (2 + 3 - 4) + 5 + 6. Let's compute that:

2 + 3 = 5, 5 - 4 = 1. So, 1 + 1 + 5 + 6 = 13. Same as original. Not helpful.

Alternatively, 1 + 2 + (3 - 4) + 5 + 6. Let's compute:

3 - 4 = -1. Then 1 + 2 + (-1) + 5 + 6 = 1 + 2 -1 +5 +6 = 13. Still same.

Hmm. So that didn't help.

What if we group more terms with the subtraction. Let's try grouping 3 - (4 + 5) + 6. So the expression becomes 1 + 2 + (3 - (4 + 5)) + 6. Let's compute:

4 +5=9, 3-9=-6. Then 1+2 + (-6) +6=1+2-6+6=3. Which is the example given. So that's 3. But we want a smaller value. So maybe if we group even more terms.

Wait, if we group 4 +5 +6 together, as above, we get 1+2+3-15=-9. That's better. But can we group more terms with the subtraction?

Alternatively, if we group 1 + 2 + 3 -4 +5 +6. Wait, that's the original. If we group 1 + (2 + 3 -4) +5 +6. As before, same result.

Alternatively, grouping 1 +2 + (3 -4) +5 +6. Still same. So maybe that approach doesn't help.

Wait, perhaps if we group the first subtraction with more terms. For example, (1 +2 +3 -4) +5 +6. Let's compute:

1+2+3=6, 6-4=2. Then 2+5+6=13. So same as original.

Alternatively, 1 + (2 +3 -4 +5) +6. Let's compute:

2+3=5, 5-4=1, 1+5=6. Then 1+6+6=13. Still same.

Alternatively, 1 +2 + (3 -4 +5) +6. Compute:

3-4= -1, -1+5=4. Then 1+2+4+6=13.

Hmm. All these groupings result in the same total. So maybe the only way to get a different value is by grouping the subtraction with the last terms.

Wait, the example given in the problem was 1 +2 +3 - (4 +5) +6=3. That groups the subtraction with 4 and 5. Let me see if we can group the subtraction with more terms. For instance, 1 +2 +3 - (4 +5 +6)= -9. That's a bigger negative. So that seems better.

But is that allowed? The problem states that we can add parentheses but cannot rearrange the terms. So the order remains 1,2,3,4,5,6. So grouping 4 +5 +6 is acceptable.

Alternatively, could we group 3 -4 +5 +6? Let's see. 3 -4= -1, then -1 +5=4, 4+6=10. Then the expression becomes 1 +2 + (3 -4 +5 +6)=1+2+10=13. Not helpful.

Alternatively, 1 + (2 +3 -4) +5 +6=1 +1 +5 +6=13.

Alternatively, (1 +2 +3 -4) + (5 +6)=2 +11=13.

Alternatively, 1 +2 + (3 -4 +5) +6=1 +2 +4 +6=13.

Alternatively, 1 + (2 +3 -4 +5) +6=1 +6 +6=13.

Alternatively, ((1 +2 +3) -4) +5 +6=6 -4 +5 +6=13.

Alternatively, 1 + ((2 +3) -4) +5 +6=1 +1 +5 +6=13.

Alternatively, 1 +2 + ((3 -4) +5) +6=1 +2 +4 +6=13.

Alternatively, 1 +2 +3 +(-4 +5) +6=6 +1 +6=13.

Alternatively, 1 +2 +3 +5 +(-4 +6)=6 +5 +2=13.

Alternatively, 1 +2 + (3 +5 -4) +6=1 +2 +4 +6=13.

Alternatively, 1 + (2 +5 -4) +3 +6=1 +3 +3 +6=13.

Alternatively, (1 +2 +5 -4) +3 +6=4 +3 +6=13.

Alternatively, 1 + (2 +3 +5 -4) +6=1 +6 +6=13.

Alternatively, (1 +2 +3 +5 -4) +6=7 +6=13.

Alternatively, 1 + (2 +3 +5) -4 +6=11 -4 +6=13.

Alternatively, (1 +2 +3 +5) -4 +6=11 -4 +6=13.

Alternatively, 1 +2 + (3 +5) -4 +6=1 +2 +8 -4 +6=13.

Alternatively, 1 + (2 +3 +5) -4 +6=1 +10 -4 +6=13.

Alternatively, (1 +2 +3 +5) - (4 +6)=11 -10=1. Wait, that's different. Let me check.

Original expression: 1 +2 +3 +5 -4 -6. Wait, but the original expression is 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6. So if we group the first four terms as (1 +2 +3 +5) and then subtract 4 and 6? Wait, but parentheses can't split the terms like that. The original expression is 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6. So if we group (1 +2 +3 +5) -4 +6, that's equivalent to ((1 +2 +3 +5) -4) +6=11 -4 +6=13. But that's the same as original. Wait, but in the original, it's 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6, so if you group (1 +2 +3 +5) - (4 +6), that would require changing the order, right? Because 1 +2 +3 +5 is four terms, and then subtracting 4 +6. But that would be 1 +2 +3 +5 -4 -6, which is the same as original. But the problem states that we cannot rearrange the terms. So, grouping (1 +2 +3 +5) - (4 +6) is actually not allowed because the original order is 1,2,3,4,5,6. So subtracting 4 and 6 would require that those terms are grouped together, but since they are in the middle and end, we can group them. Wait, but parentheses don't change the order, they just group operations. So is it allowed to group terms like (4 +5 +6) and subtract that? Yes, because the order of terms remains the same. Let me check the problem statement again: "we cannot change addition or subtraction into multiplication. For example, (1+2+3)(-4)+5+6 is not a valid placement of parentheses." So the key is that we can't rearrange the terms, but we can group operations. So grouping (4 +5 +6) is allowed because the order of the terms is preserved, just certain ones are grouped. So that's acceptable.

Therefore, the expression 1 +2 +3 - (4 +5 +6) = 6 -15 = -9. That gives a value of -9. Is that the minimum possible?

Wait, but let's see if there's a way to group even more terms with the subtraction. For example, if we have 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6. If we group the first three terms and subtract the next three, but that's the same as the original. Wait, but if we group (1 +2 +3) - (4 +5 +6), that would be 6 -15 = -9. So that's the same as before.

Alternatively, can we group more terms? Like (1 +2 +3 +4) - (5 +6). Let's compute: 1+2+3+4=10, 5+6=11, so 10 -11= -1. Then the expression would be -1. Wait, but that would require changing the order of the terms. Because the original is 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6. If we group (1 +2 +3 +4) -5 +6, that's different. Wait, but we need to group (1 +2 +3 +4) - (5 +6). But in the original expression, 5 and 6 are separate. So to group (5 +6), we need to have them adjacent, but in the original, they are adjacent already. Wait, let me check the original expression: 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6. So between 4 and 5 is a subtraction, then +5 +6. So if we group (4 +5 +6) as a single group, but that would be subtracting that group. Wait, but in the original, after 4, it's a subtraction, then +5 +6. So if we group (4 +5 +6), that would require that the subtraction applies only to 4, but if we group (4 +5 +6), then the subtraction applies to the entire group. Wait, but the original expression is 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6. So if we group (4 +5 +6), the expression becomes 1 +2 +3 - (4 +5 +6)=6 -15= -9. That's correct.

Alternatively, if we group (1 +2 +3) - (4 +5 +6)=6 -15= -9. Same result.

Alternatively, grouping (1 +2 +3 +4 +5 +6) but that's the entire expression, which would be 21. Not helpful.

Alternatively, can we group in a different way? For example, 1 + (2 +3 -4) +5 +6. Let's compute: 2+3=5, 5-4=1. Then 1 +1 +5 +6=13. Not helpful.

Alternatively, 1 +2 + (3 -4 +5 +6)=1 +2 + (4 +6)=1 +2 +10=13.

Alternatively, (1 +2 +3) -4 + (5 +6)=6 -4 +11=13.

Alternatively, 1 + ((2 +3) -4) +5 +6=1 +1 +5 +6=13.

Alternatively, 1 +2 + ((3 -4) +5) +6=1 +2 +4 +6=13.

Alternatively, 1 + (2 + (3 -4) +5) +6=1 + (2 +4) +6=1 +6 +6=13.

Alternatively, 1 + (2 +3 -4 +5) +6=1 +6 +6=13.

Alternatively, (1 +2 +3 -4) +5 +6=2 +5 +6=13.

Alternatively, 1 + (2 +3 -4 +5 +6)=1 + (10)=11. Wait, that's different. Let's check:

Original expression: 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6.

If we group (2 +3 -4 +5 +6), that would be 2 +3=5, 5-4=1, 1+5=6, 6+6=12. Then 1 +12=13. So same result.

Alternatively, if we group (1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6). That's the entire expression, which is 13.

Alternatively, group (1 +2 +3 -4) + (5 +6)=2 +11=13.

Alternatively, group (1 +2 +3) - (4 +5) +6=6 -9 +6=3.

Alternatively, group (1 +2 +3 -4 +5) +6=6 +6=12. Wait, 1+2+3-4+5=5, then 5 +6=11. Wait, 1+2+3=6, 6-4=2, 2+5=7, 7+6=13. Wait, maybe I miscalculated. Let me do it step by step:

Group (1 +2 +3 -4 +5) +6:

First compute the group: 1+2=3, 3+3=6, 6-4=2, 2+5=7. Then 7 +6=13.

So that's 13. So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, group (1 +2 +3 -4) + (5 +6)= (6 -4) +11=2 +11=13.

Alternatively, group (1 +2 +3) - (4 +5 +6)=6 -15=-9.

Alternatively, group (1 +2 +3 +4) - (5 +6)=10 -11=-1.

Wait, that's different. Let me check:

Group (1 +2 +3 +4) - (5 +6). Compute the group:

1+2+3+4=10, 5+6=11. Then 10 -11=-1. But in the original expression, the operations are 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6. So grouping (1 +2 +3 +4) would require changing the order of operations. Wait, the original expression is 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6. If we group (1 +2 +3 +4), that would be 1+2+3+4=10. Then the rest is -4 +5 +6. But that's not possible because after the group, the next term is -4. Wait, no. Wait, in the original expression, after 3 comes -4, then +5, +6. So if we group (1 +2 +3 +4), that would be 1+2+3+4=10, then the next term is -4. But that would require reordering. Wait, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps the way to group is (1 +2 +3 +4) - (5 +6). But in the original expression, the operations are 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6. So if we group (1 +2 +3 +4), that would be 1+2+3+4=10, then the next operation is -4, but 4 is already included in the group. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me clarify.

The original expression is 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6. The operations are:

1 +2 =3

3 +3 =6

6 -4 =2

2 +5 =7

7 +6 =13.

Alternatively, if we want to group (1 +2 +3 +4), we need to have those terms together, but in the original, after 3 comes -4, which is a subtraction. So grouping (1 +2 +3 +4) would require that the subtraction applies to the entire group. But the original has a subtraction only after 3. So to group (1 +2 +3 +4), we would have to change the expression's structure. For example, (1 +2 +3 +4) -5 +6. But that's not grouping 4 with 5 and 6. Wait, maybe if we group (1 +2 +3 +4 +5 +6), but that's the entire expression. Alternatively, group (1 +2 +3 +4) - (5 +6). But in the original, the operations are 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6. So to group (1 +2 +3 +4) - (5 +6), we need to have the subtraction only after 4. But the original has -4, then +5, +6. So grouping (1 +2 +3 +4) -5 +6 would change the original expression's order. That's not allowed.

Therefore, grouping (4 +5 +6) as a single group is allowed, but grouping (1 +2 +3 +4) and then subtracting (5 +6) is not possible because that would require changing the order of operations. Therefore, the only valid groupings are those that preserve the original order. Therefore, grouping (4 +5 +6) is allowed, as is grouping (1 +2 +3 +5 +6), but that would require changing the order. Wait, no. Let's clarify.

Wait, parentheses can only group existing terms. So if we have 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6, we can group terms that are adjacent or can be made adjacent by parentheses. For example, grouping 4 +5 +6 is allowed because they are adjacent in the original expression. Similarly, grouping 1 +2 +3 is allowed. But grouping 1 +2 +3 +5 +6 is not allowed because 4 is in between. So the only groupings possible are those that don't split the original expression into separate parts. Therefore, the only possible groupings are:

- Grouping 1 +2 +3 -4 as a single group.

- Grouping 4 +5 +6 as a single group.

- Grouping other combinations as long as the terms remain in order without splitting.

Therefore, the possible groupings are limited to non-overlapping groups that preserve the original order. So, the valid groupings are:

1. (1 +2 +3 -4) +5 +6

2. 1 +2 +3 - (4 +5 +6)

3. 1 +2 + (3 -4) +5 +6

4. 1 + (2 +3 -4) +5 +6

5. (1 +2 +3) -4 +5 +6

6. 1 +2 +3 -4 + (5 +6)

7. 1 +2 + (3 -4 +5) +6

8. 1 + (2 +3 -4 +5) +6

9. (1 +2 +3 -4 +5) +6

10. 1 + (2 +3 -4 +5 +6)

11. (1 +2 +3) - (4 +5) +6

12. (1 +2 +3) -4 + (5 +6)

13. 1 +2 + (3 -4) + (5 +6)

14. 1 + (2 +3 -4) + (5 +6)

15. (1 +2 +3 -4) + (5 +6)

These are all the possible groupings that preserve the original order. Now, let's compute each of these to see which gives the minimum value.

1. (1 +2 +3 -4) +5 +6: Compute the group first: 1+2+3=6, 6-4=2. Then 2 +5 +6=13.

2. 1 +2 +3 - (4 +5 +6): Compute the group: 4+5+6=15. Then 1 +2 +3 -15=6 -15=-9.

3. 1 +2 + (3 -4) +5 +6: Compute the group: 3-4=-1. Then 1+2-1+5+6=13.

4. 1 + (2 +3 -4) +5 +6: Compute the group: 2+3=5, 5-4=1. Then 1 +1 +5 +6=13.

5. 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6: Same as original, 13.

6. 1 +2 +3 -4 + (5 +6): Compute the group: 5+6=11. Then 1+2+3-4+11=6 +11=17. Wait, no: 1+2+3=6, 6-4=2, 2+11=13. So same as original.

7. 1 +2 + (3 -4 +5) +6: Compute the group: 3-4= -1, -1 +5=4. Then 1 +2 +4 +6=13.

8. 1 + (2 +3 -4 +5) +6: Compute the group: 2+3=5, 5-4=1, 1+5=6. Then 1 +6 +6=13.

9. (1 +2 +3 -4 +5) +6: Compute the group: 1+2+3=6, 6-4=2, 2+5=7. Then 7 +6=13.

10. 1 + (2 +3 -4 +5 +6): Compute the group: 2+3=5, 5-4=1, 1+5=6, 6+6=12. Then 1 +12=13.

11. (1 +2 +3) - (4 +5) +6: Compute the groups: 1+2+3=6, 4+5=9. Then 6 -9 +6=3.

12. (1 +2 +3) -4 + (5 +6): Compute the groups: 1+2+3=6, 5+6=11. Then 6 -4 +11=13.

13. 1 +2 + (3 -4) + (5 +6): Compute the groups: 3-4=-1, 5+6=11. Then 1 +2 -1 +11=13.

14. 1 + (2 +3 -4) + (5 +6): Compute the groups: 2+3=5, 5-4=1, 5+6=11. Then 1 +1 +11=13.

15. (1 +2 +3 -4) + (5 +6): Compute the groups: 1+2+3=6, 6-4=2, 5+6=11. Then 2 +11=13.

So from all these groupings, the smallest value obtained is -9 (from grouping 4 +5 +6) and 3 (from grouping 1 +2 +3 and 4 +5). So between -9 and 3, the minimum is -9.

But wait, are there any other possible groupings that I missed? Let's check.

Wait, another possible grouping could be (1 +2 +3 +4) - (5 +6). Let's compute that: 1+2+3+4=10, 5+6=11. Then 10 -11=-1. But is this grouping allowed? In the original expression, after 3 comes -4, then +5, +6. So to group (1 +2 +3 +4), we need to have that the subtraction applies only to 4, but if we group (1 +2 +3 +4), then the next operation is -5, but in the original, after 4 comes -4, which is already part of the group. Wait, no. Wait, the original expression is 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6. So if we group (1 +2 +3 +4), that would be 1+2+3+4=10, then the next operation is -4, but 4 is already included in the group. So that's not possible. Therefore, grouping (1 +2 +3 +4) is not allowed because it would require reordering the terms. Therefore, the only valid groupings are those that preserve the original order without splitting the terms. Therefore, the only possible groupings are the ones listed above, and among them, the smallest value is -9.

Therefore, the minimum possible value is -9.
