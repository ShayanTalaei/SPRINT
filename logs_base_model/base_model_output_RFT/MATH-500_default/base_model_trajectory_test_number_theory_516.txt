Okay, so I need to convert the binary number 10101001110₂ to base eight. Hmm, I remember that converting between binary and octal is done by grouping the binary digits into sets of three, starting from the right. Each group of three bits corresponds to a single octal digit. Let me think through the steps carefully.

First, let me write down the binary number: 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0. Wait, let me count the digits. The original number is 10101001110, which has 11 digits. Since octal groups are in threes, I need to split this into groups of three. But 11 isn't divisible by three. So, I should add leading zeros to make the total number of digits a multiple of three. Right, so 11 divided by 3 is 3 with a remainder of 2. That means I need to add one leading zero to make it 12 digits. So the new number becomes 010101001110₂.

Now, let me split this into groups of three starting from the right. Let me write it out:

Group 1: 010
Group 2: 101
Group 3: 001
Group 4: 110

Wait, no. Wait, the leading zeros are added at the beginning, so the original number was 10101001110. Adding a leading zero makes it 010101001110. Now, splitting into groups of three from the right:

Starting from the end, the last three digits are 110, then moving left, the next three are 001, then 101, then 010. So the groups are 010, 101, 001, 110. Now, each of these binary groups needs to be converted to their octal equivalents.

Let me convert each group:

010₂ is 2 in octal because 0*4 + 1*2 + 0*1 = 2.

101₂ is 5 in octal because 1*4 + 0*2 + 1*1 = 5.

001₂ is 1 in octal because 0*4 + 0*2 + 1*1 = 1.

110₂ is 6 in octal because 1*4 + 1*2 + 0*1 = 6.

So putting those together in order from left to right, the octal digits are 2, 5, 1, 6. Therefore, the octal number should be 2516₈. Wait, but let me verify this again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in grouping or conversion.

Wait, when grouping from the right, the first group (rightmost) is 110, then moving left, the next is 001, then 101, then 010. So the groups are 010, 101, 001, 110. Converting each to octal:

010₂ = 2, 101₂ = 5, 001₂ = 1, 110₂ = 6. So the octal number is 2 5 1 6, which is 2516₈. Let me check if this is correct by converting the original binary number to decimal and then converting that decimal number to octal to see if it matches.

First, converting 10101001110₂ to decimal. Let's write out the binary number with each digit's place value:

From right to left, the positions are 0 to 10. The digits are:

Position 10: 1

Position 9: 0

Position 8: 1

Position 7: 0

Position 6: 1

Position 5: 0

Position 4: 0

Position 3: 1

Position 2: 1

Position 1: 1

Position 0: 0

Calculating the decimal value:

1*(2^10) + 0*(2^9) + 1*(2^8) + 0*(2^7) + 1*(2^6) + 0*(2^5) + 0*(2^4) + 1*(2^3) + 1*(2^2) + 1*(2^1) + 0*(2^0)

Calculating each term:

2^10 = 1024

2^8 = 256

2^6 = 64

2^3 = 8

2^2 = 4

2^1 = 2

Adding them up: 1024 + 256 = 1280; 1280 + 64 = 1344; 1344 + 8 = 1352; 1352 + 4 = 1356; 1356 + 2 = 1358.

So the decimal value is 1358. Now, converting 1358 to octal. Let's divide 1358 by 8 repeatedly.

1358 ÷ 8 = 169 with a remainder of 6.

169 ÷ 8 = 21 with a remainder of 1.

21 ÷ 8 = 2 with a remainder of 5.

2 ÷ 8 = 0 with a remainder of 2.

Writing the remainders from last to first: 2 5 1 6. So 2516₈. Which matches the previous result. Therefore, the conversion is correct.

But wait, let me check the grouping again. The original binary number was 10101001110. When adding a leading zero, it becomes 010101001110. Splitting into groups of three from the right:

Starting from the right:

111 001 101 010. Wait, that's different. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in grouping.

Wait, the original binary number is 10101001110. Let me write it as 10 101 001 110. Wait, that's not correct. Wait, the original number is 11 digits. So when adding a leading zero, it becomes 12 digits: 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0. Then grouping from the right:

Group1: 0 1 0 (positions 11,10,9)

Group2: 1 0 1 (positions 8,7,6)

Group3: 0 0 1 (positions 5,4,3)

Group4: 1 1 0 (positions 2,1,0)

Wait, but when grouping from the right, the rightmost group is the last three digits. So the original number is 010101001110. The rightmost three digits are 110, then moving left, next three are 001, then 101, then 010. So the groups are 010, 101, 001, 110. Which is the same as before. So converting each gives 2,5,1,6. So 2516₈. Which is correct. So the answer is 2516₈.

But wait, when I grouped the original number as 10101001110, which is 11 digits, adding a leading zero makes it 010101001110, which is 12 digits. So grouping into three from the right: 010, 101, 001, 110. So that's correct.

Alternatively, another way to check is by converting each group as I did before. So yes, the answer is 2516 in octal.

But let me just confirm once again by converting 2516₈ back to binary to see if it's 10101001110₂.

2516 in octal:

Each digit corresponds to three binary digits:

2 → 010

5 → 101

1 → 001

6 → 110

So putting them together: 010 101 001 110 → 010101001110, which is the original number. So that's correct.

Therefore, the final answer is 2516 in base eight.
