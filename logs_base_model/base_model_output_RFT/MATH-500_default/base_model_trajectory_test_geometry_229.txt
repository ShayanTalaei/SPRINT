Okay, so I need to solve this problem about parallelograms bounded by lines and find the smallest possible value of a + b + c + d. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.

First, the problem mentions two parallelograms. The first one is bounded by the lines y = ax + c, y = ax + d, y = bx + c, and y = bx + d. Its area is 18. The second parallelogram is bounded by y = ax + c, y = ax - d, y = bx + c, and y = bx - d, with an area of 72. All variables a, b, c, d are positive integers, and I need to find the minimal sum a + b + c + d.

Hmm. Let me recall that the area of a parallelogram formed by four lines can be calculated using the formula involving the determinant of vectors formed by the sides. But maybe there's a simpler way here since the lines are in the form y = mx + k. These are pairs of parallel lines with slopes a and b, and y-intercepts c, d, -d, etc.

I remember that when you have two sets of parallel lines, the distance between the parallel lines can be used to find the area. The area of the parallelogram is the product of the distances between the two sets of parallel lines multiplied by the sine of the angle between them. Wait, but maybe in this case, since the lines are given in slope-intercept form, there's a formula for the distance between two parallel lines.

Yes! The distance between two parallel lines y = mx + k1 and y = mx + k2 is |k1 - k2| / sqrt(m^2 + 1). So maybe that's the key here.

Let me verify. Suppose two lines y = mx + k1 and y = mx + k2. The distance between them is |k1 - k2| divided by sqrt(m^2 + 1). That seems right. For example, if m = 0, the lines are horizontal, and the distance is just |k1 - k2|, which makes sense.

So for the first parallelogram, the sides are the lines y = ax + c and y = ax + d. The distance between these two lines is |d - c| / sqrt(a^2 + 1). Similarly, the other pair of sides are y = bx + c and y = bx + d, with distance |d - c| / sqrt(b^2 + 1). Wait, no, wait. Wait, the other pair of sides are y = bx + c and y = bx + d, so their distance is |d - c| / sqrt(b^2 + 1). So the area of the parallelogram would be the product of these two distances multiplied by the sine of the angle between the two sets of lines.

But wait, the area of a parallelogram is base * height, but here, the base would be the distance between the lines with slope a, and the height would be the distance between the lines with slope b, but actually, the area is the product of the distances between the two pairs of lines multiplied by the sine of the angle between the lines. Wait, no, maybe not. Let me think again.

Alternatively, another approach: the area of the parallelogram can be found using the formula |(x2 - x1)(y2 - y1)| where (x2 - x1) and (y2 - y1) are the differences in x and y coordinates of adjacent vertices. But since the lines are in slope-intercept form, perhaps it's better to find the coordinates of the vertices and compute the area.

But maybe there's a formula that directly relates the area of the parallelogram to the coefficients a and b and the intercepts. Let me try to recall.

Alternatively, the area of a parallelogram formed by four lines y = m1x + c1, y = m1x + c2, y = m2x + d1, y = m2x + d2 is |(c2 - c1)(d2 - d1)| / |m1 - m2|. Wait, is that correct?

Wait, let's check. If we have two sets of parallel lines with slopes m1 and m2, the area between them is |(c2 - c1)(d2 - d1)| / |m1 - m2|. Hmm, maybe. Let's see.

Suppose m1 ≠ m2, so the lines are not parallel. Then the area can be found by the product of the distances between the parallel lines divided by the sine of the angle between them. Wait, the sine of the angle between the lines is |m2 - m1| / sqrt(1 + m1^2) sqrt(1 + m2^2). Wait, maybe.

Wait, actually, the angle θ between two lines with slopes m1 and m2 is given by tanθ = |(m2 - m1)/(1 + m1m2)|. Therefore, sinθ = |m2 - m1| / sqrt(1 + m1^2) sqrt(1 + m2^2). So the area would be (distance between first pair of lines) * (distance between second pair of lines) / sinθ.

Therefore, Area = (|c2 - c1| / sqrt(1 + m1^2)) * (|d2 - d1| / sqrt(1 + m2^2)) / (|m2 - m1| / sqrt(1 + m1^2) sqrt(1 + m2^2)) )

Simplify that: The sqrt(1 + m1^2) and sqrt(1 + m2^2) terms cancel out, and we have |c2 - c1||d2 - d1| / |m2 - m1|

So the formula is |(c2 - c1)(d2 - d1)| / |m2 - m1|

So in the first parallelogram, the lines are y = ax + c, y = ax + d, y = bx + c, y = bx + d. So c2 - c1 is d - c, and d2 - d1 is also d - c. Wait, wait. Wait, in the first case, the lines are y = ax + c and y = ax + d, so the distance between them is |d - c| / sqrt(a^2 + 1). Similarly, the lines y = bx + c and y = bx + d are parallel, so their distance is |d - c| / sqrt(b^2 + 1). Then the area is the product of these two distances divided by the sine of the angle between the lines. Wait, but according to the formula I just derived, it's |(c2 - c1)(d2 - d1)| / |m2 - m1|. Wait, but in this case, c2 - c1 is d - c, and d2 - d1 is also d - c. So |(d - c)^2| / |a - b|. Since a, b, c, d are positive integers, |a - b| is just |a - b|, and (d - c)^2 is positive. Therefore, Area = (d - c)^2 / |a - b| = 18.

Similarly, for the second parallelogram, the lines are y = ax + c, y = ax - d, y = bx + c, y = bx - d. So here, the distances between the parallel lines are |(-d) - c| / sqrt(a^2 + 1) and |(-d) - c| / sqrt(b^2 + 1). So the distance between y = ax + c and y = ax - d is |c - (-d)| / sqrt(a^2 + 1) = |c + d| / sqrt(a^2 + 1). Similarly for the other pair, it's |c + d| / sqrt(b^2 + 1). Then the area would be |(c + d)^2| / |a - b| = 72.

Therefore, from the first parallelogram, we have (d - c)^2 / |a - b| = 18, and from the second, (c + d)^2 / |a - b| = 72. Let's denote k = |a - b|. Then we have:

(d - c)^2 = 18k,

(c + d)^2 = 72k.

So, we can take the ratio of these two equations:

[(c + d)^2] / [(d - c)^2] = 72k / 18k = 4.

Therefore, [(c + d)/(d - c)]^2 = 4, so (c + d)/(d - c) = 2 (since all variables are positive, the ratio is positive). Therefore, c + d = 2(d - c). Let's solve this equation:

c + d = 2d - 2c

Bring like terms together:

c + 2c = 2d - d

3c = d

So d = 3c.

Great! So we have d = 3c. Now, substitute back into the first equation:

(d - c)^2 = 18k

(3c - c)^2 = 18k

(2c)^2 = 18k

4c² = 18k

Divide both sides by 2:

2c² = 9k

So k = (2c²)/9. But k = |a - b|, which must be a positive integer since a and b are positive integers. Therefore, 2c² must be divisible by 9. Since 9 divides 2c², and 2 and 9 are coprime, 9 must divide c². Therefore, c must be a multiple of 3. Let's let c = 3m, where m is a positive integer. Then:

k = (2*(9m²))/9 = 2m². Therefore, |a - b| = 2m².

So now, we have:

d = 3c = 3*(3m) = 9m.

Thus, the variables are:

a and b are positive integers with |a - b| = 2m².

c = 3m, d = 9m.

So, to minimize a + b + c + d = a + b + 3m + 9m = a + b + 12m.

We need to minimize this sum, given that a and b are positive integers with |a - b| = 2m², and c and d are 3m and 9m, respectively.

Since m is a positive integer, the smallest possible m is 1. Let's check m = 1 first.

If m = 1, then c = 3, d = 9. Then |a - b| = 2*(1)^2 = 2. So a - b = ±2.

Assuming a > b, then a = b + 2. To minimize a + b, we can take the smallest possible b. Since b must be a positive integer, the smallest b is 1, so a = 3. Then a + b = 3 + 1 = 4. Then total sum is 4 + 3 + 9 = 16. Wait, c + d is 3 + 9 = 12, so total sum is a + b + c + d = 3 + 1 + 3 + 9 = 16.

Alternatively, if a < b, then b = a + 2. Then to minimize a + b, set a = 1, b = 3. So a + b = 4, same total. So either way, the total sum is 16.

But let's check if m = 1 is acceptable. Let's see if the areas are satisfied. Let me verify.

First parallelogram: (d - c)^2 / |a - b| = (9 - 3)^2 / 2 = 36 / 2 = 18. Correct.

Second parallelogram: (c + d)^2 / |a - b| = (3 + 9)^2 / 2 = 144 / 2 = 72. Correct. So m = 1 works.

But wait, the problem states that a, b, c, d are positive integers. So with m = 1, we have c = 3, d = 9, a and b being 1 and 3 or 3 and 1. Both are positive integers. So that's a valid solution. Therefore, the minimal sum is 16. Wait, but hold on, the problem says "smallest possible value of a + b + c + d". If m =1 gives 16, is there a smaller m? Wait, m must be a positive integer, so m=1 is the smallest. But let's check if m=1 is allowed. Wait, with m=1, c=3, d=9, and a and b such that |a - b|=2. Then a and b can be 1 and 3. So that's acceptable. Therefore, the minimal sum is 16. So why is the answer not 16? Wait, wait, but let me think again.

Wait, but hold on. Wait, in the problem statement, the first parallelogram is bounded by y = ax + c, y = ax + d, y = bx + c, y = bx + d. The distance between the lines y = ax + c and y = ax + d is |d - c| / sqrt(a² + 1). Similarly, the distance between y = bx + c and y = bx + d is |d - c| / sqrt(b² + 1). The area of the parallelogram is the product of these two distances divided by the sine of the angle between the lines. Wait, but earlier we derived the area formula as |(c2 - c1)(d2 - d1)| / |a - b|, but actually, according to the standard formula, the area is (distance1 * distance2) / sin(theta), where theta is the angle between the lines.

But in our case, we found that sin(theta) = |a - b| / sqrt(1 + a²) sqrt(1 + b²). Therefore, the area would be (|d - c| / sqrt(1 + a²)) * (|d - c| / sqrt(1 + b²)) / (|a - b| / sqrt(1 + a²) sqrt(1 + b²)) ) = |d - c|² / |a - b|. Which matches the formula we had earlier. So that's correct.

Therefore, with m =1, the areas are satisfied. Therefore, the minimal sum is 16. But wait, the problem says "the smallest possible value of a + b + c + d". So if m=1 gives 16, which seems possible.

But wait, let's check if m=1 is acceptable. Wait, a and b must be positive integers. For m=1, a and b can be 1 and 3 or 3 and 1. Since both are positive integers, that's acceptable. So that's a valid solution.

Therefore, the minimal sum is 16. But wait, the answer is 16? But the problem states "Given that a, b, c, and d are positive integers, what is the smallest possible value of a + b + c + d?"

Wait, but maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check again.

Wait, if m=1, then c=3, d=9, and |a - b|=2. Then a and b are 1 and 3 or 3 and 1. So a + b + c + d = 1 + 3 + 3 + 9 = 16, or 3 + 1 + 3 + 9 = 16. So that's correct.

But let me check if there is a smaller m. But m must be a positive integer, so m=1 is the smallest. Therefore, 16 is the minimal sum. But wait, the problem is from a competition, maybe the answer is higher. Let me see.

Wait, but maybe my assumption that |a - b| = 2m² is correct. Let me verify again.

From the first equation: (d - c)^2 = 18k, where k = |a - b|. From the second equation: (c + d)^2 = 72k. Then taking the ratio gives [(c + d)/(d - c)]² = 4, so (c + d)/(d - c) = 2, so c + d = 2(d - c), leading to 3c = d. Then, substituting into the first equation:

(d - c)^2 = 18k => (2c)^2 = 18k => 4c² = 18k => k = (4c²)/18 = (2c²)/9.

Therefore, 2c² must be divisible by 9, so c² must be divisible by 9/2, but since c is integer, c² must be divisible by 9. Therefore, c must be divisible by 3. So c = 3m, leading to k = 2*(9m²)/9 = 2m². Therefore, |a - b| = 2m². So m must be a positive integer. Therefore, m=1 gives the minimal value. Therefore, the minimal sum is 16.

But wait, maybe the problem expects a different answer. Let me check.

Wait, maybe m can be a half-integer? Wait, no, because c and d have to be integers, and c = 3m. So if m is 1, c=3, which is integer. If m=1/3, then c=1, but m must be integer? Wait, no, m is defined as c=3m, but m has to be an integer because c is integer. So m must be a positive integer. Therefore, m=1 is the minimal.

Therefore, the answer is 16. But I think the answer is 16, but let me check once more.

Wait, let's take m=1, c=3, d=9, and a=3, b=1. Then the first parallelogram has sides y=3x+3, y=3x+9, y=1x+3, y=1x+9. The distance between y=3x+3 and y=3x+9 is |9-3| / sqrt(3² + 1) = 6 / sqrt(10). The distance between y=x+3 and y=x+9 is 6 / sqrt(2). The area would be (6 / sqrt(10)) * (6 / sqrt(2)) / sin(theta), where theta is the angle between the lines y=3x and y=x. The angle between lines with slopes 3 and 1 is arctan((3 - 1)/(1 + 3*1)) = arctan(2/4) = arctan(1/2). So sin(theta) = 1/√5. Therefore, area = (6 / sqrt(10)) * (6 / sqrt(2)) / (1 / sqrt(5)) ) = (36 / sqrt(20)) * sqrt(5) ) = (36 / (2*sqrt(5))) * sqrt(5) ) = 36/2 = 18. Correct.

Similarly, the second parallelogram has sides y=3x+3, y=3x-9, y=x+3, y=x-9. Wait, but in this case, the lines y=3x-9 and y=3x+3 have distance |3 - (-9)| / sqrt(3² + 1) = 12 / sqrt(10). The lines y=x-9 and y=x+3 have distance |3 - (-9)| / sqrt(1² + 1) = 12 / sqrt(2). The angle between the lines is still arctan(1/2), so sin(theta) = 1/sqrt(5). Therefore, area = (12 / sqrt(10)) * (12 / sqrt(2)) / (1/sqrt(5)) ) = (144 / sqrt(20)) * sqrt(5) ) = (144 / (2*sqrt(5))) * sqrt(5) ) = 144 / 2 = 72. Correct.

Therefore, all conditions are satisfied with a=3, b=1, c=3, d=9, and the sum is 3 + 1 + 3 + 9 = 16. So that's correct. So the minimal sum is 16. Therefore, the answer is 16.

But wait, let me check if there is a possibility with a smaller sum. Suppose m=1, but maybe a and b can be smaller? For example, if m=1, and a=1, b=3. Then the sum is 1 + 3 + 3 + 9 = 16, same as before. So same result.

Alternatively, maybe m=2. Let's see: m=2, then c=6, d=18. Then |a - b| = 2*(2)^2 = 8. So a and b differ by 8. Let's take a=9, b=1. Then sum is 9 + 1 + 6 + 18 = 34, which is larger than 16. So no improvement.

If m=1, the sum is 16. If m=0.5, but m must be integer. Therefore, m=1 is indeed the minimal.

Therefore, the answer is 16. So I think that's the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{16}
Therefore, the smallest possible value of $a + b + c + d$ is $\boxed{16}$.
