Okay, let me try to figure out this geometry problem. The area of triangle ABC is 6 square centimeters. We know that line AB is parallel to line DE, and BD is four times BC. We need to find the area of triangle CDE. Hmm, let me start by visualizing the diagram. There's an Asymptote code given, but I can imagine the points: A is above, B and C are at the base, and D is further along the line from B, and E is another point connected to D and A. Since AB is parallel to DE, maybe there's some similarity between the triangles involved here.

First, let me recall that if two triangles are similar, the ratio of their areas is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. But before that, maybe I should check if triangles ABC and CDE are similar. Since AB is parallel to DE, the corresponding angles might be equal. Let me think: angle ABC corresponds to angle CDE? Wait, maybe not. Let me see. If AB is parallel to DE, then angle BAC corresponds to angle DCE, and angle ABC corresponds to angle CED. Hmm, so maybe triangles ABC and CDE are similar by AA similarity? Because two angles are equal due to the parallel lines. That could be the case.

If they are similar, then the ratio of their areas would be the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. But what is the ratio of their sides? We know BD = 4BC. Let me parse that. BD is the segment from B to D, and BC is the segment from B to C. So BD is four times BC, which would mean that D is a point such that BD = 4BC. So if BC is, say, x, then BD is 4x. Therefore, the entire length of CD would be BC + BD? Wait, no. Wait, points B, C, D are colinear? Let me check the Asymptote code: the coordinates are given as A at (.1,1), B at (-1,0), C at (0,0), D at (3,0), and E at (-.3,-3). So points B, C, D are along the x-axis. So BC is from (-1,0) to (0,0), which is 1 unit. BD is from (-1,0) to (3,0), which is 4 units. So yes, BD = 4BC. So BC is 1, BD is 4, so CD is BD - BC = 4 - 1 = 3? Wait, no. Wait, in the diagram, points are B at (-1,0), C at (0,0), and D at (3,0). So BC is 1 unit (from -1 to 0 on the x-axis), BD is from -1 to 3, which is 4 units. So CD is from C (0,0) to D (3,0), which is 3 units. So BC is 1, CD is 3. Therefore, BD is BC + CD = 1 + 3 = 4, which matches BD = 4BC. So BC is 1, CD is 3. So the ratio of CD to BC is 3:1. Therefore, CD = 3 BC. So if CD is 3 times BC, and if triangles ABC and CDE are similar with a ratio of 3, then the area would be 6 * (3)^2 = 54? But that seems too big. Wait, but maybe the similarity ratio is different.

Wait, let's think again. If AB is parallel to DE, then triangle ABC and triangle CDE are similar. Because AB || DE implies that angle BAC = angle DCE (corresponding angles) and angle ABC = angle CED (alternate interior angles). Therefore, triangles ABC and CDE are similar by AA similarity. So the ratio of similarity is the ratio of BC to CD. BC is 1, CD is 3, so the ratio is 1:3. Wait, but in similar triangles, the ratio is the ratio of corresponding sides. So if ABC ~ CDE, then AB corresponds to CD, and BC corresponds to CE? Wait, maybe I need to get the correspondence right. Let's see: angle BAC corresponds to angle DCE, angle ABC corresponds to angle CED. Therefore, the sides opposite to these angles would correspond. So in triangle ABC, side AB is opposite angle C, which corresponds to side DE in triangle CDE? Wait, maybe I'm confusing the correspondence.

Alternatively, maybe the ratio is BC/CD. Since BD = 4 BC, and BC is 1, BD is 4, so CD is BD - BC = 3. Therefore, BC/CD = 1/3. Therefore, the ratio of similarity is 1/3. Therefore, the area ratio would be (1/3)^2 = 1/9. Therefore, the area of triangle CDE would be 6 * (1/9) = 2/3? Wait, but that seems small. Let me check again.

Wait, maybe the ratio is CD/BC = 3/1, so the similarity ratio is 3, so the area ratio is 9, so the area of CDE would be 6/9 = 2/3. But then the answer is 2/3, but let me verify.

Alternatively, maybe I need to use coordinates to calculate the areas.

Given the Asymptote code, the coordinates are:

A: (0.1, 1)

B: (-1, 0)

C: (0, 0)

D: (3, 0)

E: (-0.3, -3)

So maybe I can use coordinates to find the area of CDE. Let's try that.

First, let's confirm the coordinates:

A: (0.1, 1)

B: (-1, 0)

C: (0, 0)

D: (3, 0)

E: (-0.3, -3)

So triangle CDE has points C (0,0), D (3,0), and E (-0.3, -3). Let's use the formula for the area of a triangle given coordinates.

The formula is:

Area = |(x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2))/2|

So plugging in the coordinates for CDE:

x1 = 0, y1 = 0

x2 = 3, y2 = 0

x3 = -0.3, y3 = -3

Area = |(0*(0 - (-3)) + 3*(-3 - 0) + (-0.3)*(0 - 0))/2|

= |0 + 3*(-3) + (-0.3)*0| / 2

= |0 -9 + 0| / 2

= | -9 | /2 = 9/2 = 4.5

But wait, the area of triangle CDE is 4.5 cm²? But the problem states that the area of triangle ABC is 6 cm². Let's check the area of ABC using coordinates.

Points A (0.1,1), B (-1,0), C (0,0).

Area ABC:

| (0.1*(0 - 0) + (-1)*(0 - 1) + 0*(1 - 0)) / 2 |

= |0 + (-1)*(-1) + 0| /2

= |0 +1 +0| /2 = 1/2 = 0.5

Wait, but the problem says the area is 6 cm². So the given Asymptote code must be scaled. Because according to the coordinates, the area of ABC is 0.5, but in the problem it's 6. So there's a scaling factor here. So maybe the coordinates are just a diagram, not to scale. Therefore, I can't directly use the coordinates to compute areas. Instead, I need to solve the problem using geometric principles.

Therefore, the Asymptote code is just an illustration, but the actual problem has ABC area 6. So I need to use the given information: AB || DE, BD = 4 BC, area ABC = 6. Find area CDE.

Okay, so let's consider the diagram again. Since AB is parallel to DE, triangles ABC and CDE are similar. Let's confirm that.

Because AB || DE, angle BAC = angle DCE (corresponding angles). Also, angle ABC = angle CED (alternate interior angles). Therefore, triangles ABC ~ CDE by AA similarity.

Therefore, the ratio of similarity is the ratio of corresponding sides. Let's find the ratio of BC to CD.

From BD = 4 BC. BD is the length from B to D. Since BC is a segment, and BD is four times BC. Let's denote BC = x. Then BD = 4x. Therefore, CD = BD - BC = 4x - x = 3x. Therefore, CD = 3 BC. Therefore, the ratio of BC to CD is 1:3. Therefore, the ratio of similarity between ABC and CDE is 1:3.

Therefore, the ratio of areas is (1/3)^2 = 1/9. Therefore, area of CDE = 6 * (1/9) = 2/3.

Wait, but that seems conflicting with the Asymptote code's coordinates, which gave a different area. But since the problem states that the area of ABC is 6, not 0.5, the scaling factor must be considered.

Wait, maybe the ratio is different. Let me think again. If BD = 4 BC, then BC is 1 part, BD is 4 parts. So the entire length from B to D is 4 parts, but BC is 1 part. Therefore, CD is BD - BC = 3 parts. Therefore, CD is 3 times BC. Therefore, ratio of CD to BC is 3:1. Therefore, the ratio of similarity is CD / BC = 3. Therefore, the ratio of areas is 3² = 9. Therefore, area of CDE is 6 * 9 = 54?

Wait, that contradicts the previous conclusion. So now I'm confused. Which is correct?

Wait, the problem is whether the ratio is BC/CD or CD/BC. If ABC ~ CDE with ratio BC/CD, then the area ratio is (BC/CD)^2. If CD is 3 BC, then BC/CD = 1/3, so area ratio is 1/9. But if the similarity ratio is CD/BC = 3, then area ratio is 9. So which one is correct?

Wait, similarity ratio is the ratio of corresponding sides. So if ABC ~ CDE, then AB corresponds to CD, BC corresponds to DE, and AC corresponds to CE. Wait, maybe I need to get the correspondence right.

Alternatively, maybe the triangles are similar with the ratio of BC to CE. Wait, perhaps I need to use vectors or coordinate geometry to find the ratio.

Alternatively, let's use coordinates to find the ratio, even though the given coordinates are scaled. Let's assume coordinates are scaled.

Wait, let me think. Since AB is parallel to DE, the lines AB and DE are parallel. Therefore, the triangles ABC and CDE are similar with a center of similarity at point C. Because lines AB and DE are parallel, the lines connecting corresponding points (A to D, B to E) should meet at the center of similarity, which is point C. Wait, but in the Asymptote code, points A and D are connected? Wait, no. Wait, the Asymptote code draws (A to B to C to D to E to A). Wait, maybe not. Let me check: the Asymptote code is draw((-.3,-3)--(.1,1)--(-1,0)--(3,0)--cycle); label("$A$",(.1,1),N); label("$B$",(-1,0),W); label("$C$",(0,0),NE); label("$D$",(3,0),E); label("$E$",(-.3,-3),S); So it's drawing a polygon connecting E to A to B to C to D to E. So the figure is a pentagon? Wait, but the problem mentions triangles ABC and CDE. So maybe the figure is such that ABC is a triangle with base BC, and CDE is another triangle. Let me see.

In the Asymptote code, the coordinates are:

A: (0.1, 1)

B: (-1, 0)

C: (0, 0)

D: (3, 0)

E: (-0.3, -3)

So connecting A to B to C to D to E to A. So the figure is a polygon with vertices E, A, B, C, D, E. So E is connected to A, A to B, B to C, C to D, D to E, E to A. So the triangles involved are ABC and CDE. Let me see.

Triangle ABC is formed by points A, B, C. Triangle CDE is formed by points C, D, E.

Given that AB is parallel to DE, which are sides of triangles ABC and CDE respectively. So AB || DE. Since AB is a side of ABC and DE is a side of CDE, and they are parallel.

Therefore, triangles ABC and CDE are similar, as they have two sides parallel and hence the angles are equal.

So the ratio of similarity is determined by the ratio of corresponding sides. Since AB || DE, the ratio can be found by the ratio of the lengths of AB to DE, or BC to CD, etc.

But we know that BD = 4 BC. Let's parse that. BD is the length from B to D, which is 4 times BC. Since BC is from B to C. So if BC is x, BD is 4x. Then CD is BD - BC = 3x. So CD is 3 BC.

Therefore, the ratio of BC to CD is 1:3. Since triangles ABC and CDE are similar, the ratio of their areas is (BC/CD)^2 = (1/3)^2 = 1/9. Therefore, area of CDE is 6 * (1/9) = 2/3. But the Asymptote code suggests a different area. However, the Asymptote code is just a diagram and the actual problem has area ABC as 6, so the scaling factor is different.

Wait, maybe I need to use coordinate geometry with the given scaling. Let's assume that the coordinates are scaled such that the area of ABC is 6. Let me compute the area of ABC in the given coordinates.

Points A: (0.1, 1), B: (-1, 0), C: (0, 0).

Using the shoelace formula:

Area = |(0.1*(0 - 0) + (-1)*(0 - 1) + 0*(1 - 0))/2|

= |0 + (-1)*(-1) + 0| /2

= |0 + 1 + 0| /2 = 1/2.

But in the problem, the area is 6. Therefore, the scaling factor k satisfies (1/2)*k² = 6. So k² = 12, k = 2√3. Therefore, all lengths are scaled by 2√3. Therefore, the area of CDE in the diagram would be 4.5 * k² = 4.5 * 12 = 54. Which matches the previous calculation of 6 * 9 = 54. Therefore, the area of CDE is 54? But the problem says "the area of triangle ABC is 6 square centimeters. What is the area of triangle CDE?" So according to this, it's 54. But maybe I made a mistake in the ratio.

Wait, but according to the problem, BD = 4 BC. In the Asymptote code, BD is from B (-1,0) to D (3,0), which is 4 units. BC is from B (-1,0) to C (0,0), which is 1 unit. So BD = 4 BC. Therefore, the ratio is 4:1. Then, the ratio of BC to CD is 1:3, so the similarity ratio is 1:3. Therefore, area ratio 1:9, so area CDE is 6 * 9 = 54. But according to the coordinates, the area is 4.5, which when scaled by k² = 12 gives 54. So that seems correct.

But why did the initial thought process suggest 2/3? Because I considered the ratio as 3:1 instead of 1:3. So the key is to get the ratio right. Let's confirm.

If triangles ABC and CDE are similar, and AB || DE, then the ratio of similarity is the ratio of BC to CD. Since BD = 4 BC, and BD = BC + CD, so CD = 3 BC. Therefore, BC/CD = 1/3. Therefore, the ratio of ABC to CDE is 1/3, so area ratio is (1/3)^2 = 1/9. Therefore, area CDE is 6 * 9 = 54.

Therefore, the answer should be 54. But wait, in the Asymptote code, the area of CDE is 4.5, which when scaled gives 54. But according to the coordinates, the area of ABC is 0.5, which when scaled gives 6. So the scaling factor is 12. Therefore, 4.5 * 12 = 54. Therefore, the answer is 54.

But wait, let me think again. Since the problem states that BD = 4 BC, which in the Asymptote code is BD = 4 BC (as BD is 4 units and BC is 1 unit). So the ratio is BD/BC = 4, so BC/BD = 1/4. But in terms of similarity, since AB || DE, the ratio of similarity is BC/CD. Since CD = 3 BC, the ratio is 1/3. Therefore, the area ratio is 1/9. Therefore, area CDE is 6 * 9 = 54. Therefore, the answer is 54.

Wait, but another way to think about it is using coordinates. Let's set up coordinates such that ABC is a triangle with area 6. Let's take BC as the base. Let me place point B at (0,0), point C at (k, 0), so BC = k. Then BD = 4 BC = 4k, so D is at (5k, 0). Then, AB is parallel to DE. Let me assume point A is somewhere above the base BC. Let's assign coordinates: B (0,0), C (k, 0), D (5k, 0). Let point A be at (a, h). Then AB is the line from (0,0) to (a, h), and DE is the line from D (5k, 0) to E (e_x, e_y). Since AB || DE, their slopes must be equal. The slope of AB is h/a. The slope of DE is (e_y - 0)/(e_x - 5k) = e_y/(e_x - 5k). Therefore, h/a = e_y/(e_x - 5k). Therefore, e_y = (h/a)(e_x - 5k).

Now, we need to find the area of triangle ABC. The area of ABC is 6, which is (1/2)*base*height = (1/2)*k*h = 6. Therefore, k*h = 12.

Now, we need to find the area of triangle CDE. Triangle CDE has points C (k, 0), D (5k, 0), E (e_x, e_y). The area can be found using the shoelace formula or determinant.

Area = (1/2)| (k*(0 - e_y) + 5k*(e_y - 0) + e_x*(0 - 0) ) | = (1/2)| -k e_y + 5k e_y | = (1/2)|4k e_y| = 2k |e_y|

But from earlier, e_y = (h/a)(e_x - 5k). Therefore, Area CDE = 2k*(h/a)|e_x - 5k|

But we need to relate e_x and e_y. Since AB is parallel to DE, and AB is from (0,0) to (a, h), DE is from (5k, 0) to (e_x, e_y). Also, since AB || DE, the vector AB is (a, h), and the vector DE is (e_x - 5k, e_y). Since they are parallel, DE = m*AB for some scalar m. Therefore, (e_x - 5k, e_y) = m*(a, h). Therefore, e_x = 5k + m a, e_y = m h.

Therefore, e_y = m h, and e_x = 5k + m a.

Therefore, substituting back into the area of ABC:

Area ABC = (1/2)*k*h = 6 => k h = 12.

Area CDE = 2k |e_y| = 2k |m h|.

But we need to find m. Let's see. Also, since E is a point connected to A, but in the Asymptote code, E is connected to A, but in the problem statement, there's no direct connection. Wait, maybe E is determined by the parallel lines. Since AB || DE, and lines AB and DE are connected by points A and D, but E is another point. Wait, maybe E is the intersection of some lines? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the figure is a polygon connecting E to A to B to C to D to E. So E is connected to A and D. So EA and ED are sides of the polygon. Therefore, in the problem figure, E is connected to A and D.

Therefore, perhaps E lies on some line. Since AB is parallel to DE, and E is connected to D and A. Maybe E is the intersection of lines AE and BD? Wait, not sure. Alternatively, since AB || DE, the lines AB and DE are parallel, so the lines AE and BD are transversals. Therefore, the triangles ABE and DBE might be similar? Wait, maybe not.

Alternatively, since AB || DE, the distance between AB and DE is constant. Therefore, the height of triangle CDE can be related to the height of triangle ABC.

Alternatively, since AB || DE, the ratio of similarity is the ratio of the heights. Let me think. Let me denote the height of triangle ABC as h (from A to BC). Then, the height of triangle CDE would be the distance from E to line CD. Since AB || DE, the distance between AB and DE is the same as the distance between A and D. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, since AB || DE, the ratio of similarity is determined by the ratio of the lengths of BC to CD. Since BC = k, CD = 3k. Therefore, the ratio is 1:3. Therefore, the area ratio is 1:9, so area CDE is 6 * 9 = 54.

But then why did the coordinate system suggest 54? Because in the coordinates, the area of CDE was 4.5, which scaled up by 12 gives 54. So that seems consistent.

Alternatively, maybe using vectors:

Let me set coordinate system with B at origin (0,0). Let BC = vector c, BD = 4 BC, so D is at 5c. Let AB be a vector a, and DE is parallel to AB, so DE = λ a for some scalar λ. Then, coordinates:

A = a

B = 0

C = c

D = 5c

E = D + DE = 5c + λ a

Then, area of ABC is (1/2)|a × c| = 6.

Area of CDE is (1/2)|(5c - c) × (E - C)| = (1/2)|4c × (5c + λ a - c)| = (1/2)|4c × (4c + λ a)| = (1/2)|16 c × c + 4λ c × a| = (1/2)|0 + 4λ c × a| = 2λ |c × a|.

But |c × a| is twice the area of ABC, so |c × a| = 2 * 6 = 12. Therefore, area of CDE = 2λ * 12 = 24λ.

But we need to find λ. Since DE is parallel to AB, DE = λ AB. But the length of DE is λ |AB|. Also, since BD = 4 BC, and BC = |c|, BD = 4|c|. But BD is the length from B to D, which in this coordinate system is |5c| = 5|c|. Therefore, 5|c| = 4|c| => 5 = 4. Wait, that can't be. Therefore, something's wrong here.

Wait, maybe the coordinate system is not the best approach here. Let me try a different method.

Since AB || DE, the triangles ABC and CDE are similar. The ratio of similarity is BC/CD. Since BD = 4 BC, and BD = BC + CD, so CD = 3 BC. Therefore, BC/CD = 1/3. Therefore, the ratio of similitude is 1/3. Therefore, the area ratio is (1/3)^2 = 1/9. Therefore, area of CDE is 6 / (1/9) = 54. Therefore, the answer is 54.

But in the Asymptote code, the area of CDE is 4.5, which when scaled by 12 gives 54. So that seems consistent. Therefore, the answer is 54.

But wait, let me cross-verify once more. Suppose BC = 1, BD = 4, so CD = 3. Ratio BC/CD = 1/3. Therefore, triangles ABC and CDE are similar with ratio 1/3. Therefore, area ratio 1/9. Therefore, area CDE = 6 * 9 = 54. Therefore, the answer is 54. Therefore, the area of triangle CDE is \boxed{54}.

But wait, hold on. Let me think again. If the ratio is 1/3, then the area ratio is 1/9. So area of CDE is area ABC * (1/3)^2 = 6 * 1/9 = 2/3. But that contradicts the previous conclusion. So which one is correct?

Wait, maybe the ratio is 3:1 instead of 1:3. Wait, similarity ratio is the ratio of corresponding sides. If ABC ~ CDE, then side AB corresponds to side CD, BC corresponds to DE, and AC corresponds to CE. Since AB || DE, the ratio of AB to DE is equal to the ratio of BC to CD. Wait, but we don't know DE's length. Hmm, maybe this approach is not helpful.

Alternatively, since AB || DE, the ratio of similarity can be found by the ratio of distances from corresponding points. Let me consider the homothety (scaling) that maps ABC to CDE. Since AB || DE, the center of homothety lies at the intersection of lines AC and BD. Let me find that intersection point.

In coordinate terms, if we set B at (0,0), C at (k, 0), D at (5k, 0), and A at (a, h). Then line AC is from (a, h) to (k, 0). Line BD is from (0,0) to (5k, 0). Wait, but BD is along the x-axis, and AC is from (a, h) to (k, 0). The intersection point of AC and BD is the center of homothety. Let me find where AC intersects BD.

BD is the x-axis from (0,0) to (5k, 0). AC is the line from (a, h) to (k, 0). The parametric equation of AC is:

x = a + t(k - a)

y = h + t(0 - h) = h(1 - t)

for t from 0 to 1.

The x-axis is y = 0. So set y = 0:

h(1 - t) = 0 => t = 1.

But at t = 1, x = a + 1*(k - a) = k. So the intersection point is (k, 0), which is point C. Therefore, the center of homothety is point C. Therefore, the homothety maps ABC to CDE with center C. The ratio of homothety is the ratio of distances from C. Let's compute the ratio.

Since homothety maps A to D and B to E. Therefore, the ratio is the scaling factor from ABC to CDE. The distance from C to B is CB = k. The distance from C to D is CD = 5k - k = 4k. Therefore, the ratio is CD / CB = 4k / k = 4. Therefore, the homothety ratio is 4. Therefore, the area ratio is 4² = 16. Therefore, area of CDE is area ABC * 16 = 6 * 16 = 96. But this contradicts previous results. So now I'm really confused.

Wait, but homothety maps ABC to CDE with center C and ratio 4. Therefore, every point is mapped by a factor of 4 from center C. Therefore, point B (distance CB = k) is mapped to D (distance CD = 4k). Therefore, the ratio is 4. Therefore, the area scales by 16. Therefore, area CDE is 6 * 16 = 96. But this contradicts both previous results. So which one is correct?

Wait, maybe the homothety ratio is different. Let's check.

The homothety center is C. The scaling factor is the ratio of distances from C. So CB is scaled to CD. CB is k, CD is 4k. Therefore, scaling factor is 4k / k = 4. Therefore, the area scales by 4² = 16. Therefore, area CDE is 6 * 16 = 96. But according to the coordinate system, the area is 4.5, which when scaled by 12 gives 54. Therefore, 54 ≠ 96. Therefore, there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, maybe my coordinate system was wrong. Let me re-examine the coordinates. If the Asymptote code is given, then in the code, the coordinates are:

A: (0.1, 1)

B: (-1, 0)

C: (0, 0)

D: (3, 0)

E: (-0.3, -3)

So BD is from (-1,0) to (3,0), which is 4 units. BC is from (-1,0) to (0,0), which is 1 unit. Therefore, BD = 4 BC. So in this coordinate system, BD is 4 BC. So the scaling factor k is 4. Therefore, the scaling factor between ABC and CDE is 4. Therefore, area ratio is 16. Therefore, area of CDE is 6 * 16 = 96. But according to the coordinates, the area of CDE is 4.5, which when scaled by (4)^2 = 16 gives 72, but 4.5*16=72. However, in the problem, the area of ABC is 6. So 0.5*16=8, which is not 6. Therefore, the scaling factor is different. Therefore, perhaps the scaling factor is not uniform. Wait, perhaps the coordinate system is not uniform. Because in the Asymptote code, the y-axis is scaled differently. Let me check.

In the Asymptote code, the y-coordinates are (0.1,1), (-1,0), (0,0), (3,0), (-0.3,-3). So the vertical scale is different from the horizontal scale. Therefore, the figure is not drawn to scale. Therefore, we cannot rely on the coordinates for actual lengths. Therefore, the coordinate system is just for drawing purposes, and we need to solve the problem using geometric principles.

Therefore, returning to the problem, given that AB || DE, BD = 4 BC, and area ABC = 6. Therefore, triangles ABC and CDE are similar with ratio BC/CD = 1/3. Therefore, area ratio 1/9. Therefore, area of CDE is 6 * 9 = 54. But according to the homothety approach, the scaling factor is 4, so area ratio 16. Which is correct?

Wait, let's use the coordinate system with B at (0,0), C at (1,0), D at (5,0). Let me assign coordinates here.

Let me set:

B: (0,0)

C: (1,0)

BD = 4 BC, so BC = 1, BD = 4. Therefore, D is at (4,0). Wait, but BD is from B to D, so if BC is from B to C (1 unit), then BD is 4 units. Therefore, coordinates:

B: (0,0)

C: (1,0)

D: (4,0)

Then, AB is parallel to DE. Let me place point A somewhere above the x-axis. Let me assign coordinates:

A: (a, h)

Then, line AB goes from (0,0) to (a, h). Line DE goes from D (4,0) to E (e_x, e_y). Since AB || DE, the slope of AB equals the slope of DE.

Slope of AB: (h - 0)/(a - 0) = h/a.

Slope of DE: (e_y - 0)/(e_x - 4) = e_y/(e_x - 4).

Therefore, h/a = e_y/(e_x - 4). Therefore, e_y = (h/a)(e_x - 4).

Now, area of triangle ABC is 6. Using coordinates:

A: (a, h), B: (0,0), C: (1,0).

Area = (1/2)| (a*(0 - 0) + 0*(0 - h) + 1*(h - 0) | = (1/2)|0 + 0 + h| = h/2 = 6. Therefore, h/2 = 6 => h = 12.

Therefore, h = 12. Therefore, e_y = (12/a)(e_x - 4).

Now, we need to find the area of triangle CDE. Points C (1,0), D (4,0), E (e_x, e_y).

Area of CDE is (1/2)|1*(0 - e_y) + 4*(e_y - 0) + e_x*(0 - 0)| = (1/2)| -e_y + 4 e_y | = (1/2)|3 e_y| = (3/2)|e_y|.

But e_y = (12/a)(e_x - 4). Therefore, Area CDE = (3/2)*(12/a)|e_x - 4| = (18/a)|e_x - 4|.

But we need another equation to relate e_x and a. Let's see. Since the figure is a closed polygon (as per Asymptote code), but in reality, without more information, we need another relation. However, perhaps we can use the fact that in the Asymptote code, the figure is drawn as a polygon connecting E to A and D. Therefore, lines EA and ED are part of the figure. However, since the problem statement doesn't mention these lines, maybe they are not relevant.

Alternatively, perhaps we can assume that point E lies on a specific line. Wait, in the Asymptote code, E is at (-0.3,-3). But in our coordinate system, E is at (e_x, e_y). Without additional constraints, it's difficult to determine e_x and e_y. Therefore, perhaps we need to find the ratio of areas in terms of the given information.

But since we have h = 12, and the area of CDE is (3/2)|e_y|, and e_y = (12/a)(e_x - 4). Therefore, Area CDE = (3/2)*(12/a)|e_x - 4| = (18/a)|e_x - 4|.

But we need another relationship. Wait, perhaps the lines AE and BD intersect at some point? Or perhaps lines AB and DE are the only given parallel lines. Since AB || DE, and BD is a transversal, the ratio of division is preserved. Therefore, AB/DE = BB'/DD', but not sure.

Alternatively, since AB || DE, the triangles ABC and CDE are similar with ratio BC/CD = 1/3. Therefore, the ratio of areas is 1/9, so area CDE is 6 * 9 = 54. Therefore, the answer is 54. But according to the coordinate system, we have e_y = (12/a)(e_x - 4), but without another equation, we can't determine e_x and e_y. However, the problem doesn't provide additional information, so perhaps the ratio is sufficient.

Therefore, despite the coordinate system suggesting 54 when scaled, the coordinate code seems to be a different scaling. Therefore, the correct answer is 54. But wait, the Asymptote code in the problem statement has area CDE as 4.5, which when scaled by 12 gives 54. Therefore, the answer is 54. However, the homothety approach suggested 96, but that's because the scaling factor was miscalculated. Wait, in the homothety approach, the center is C, and the scaling factor is BD / BC = 4. Therefore, the ratio is 4, so area ratio 16. Therefore, area CDE is 6 * 16 = 96. But according to coordinate system with scaling, it's 54. So which is correct?

Wait, hold on. The homothety maps ABC to CDE with center C and ratio 4. Therefore, the area scales by 4²=16. But in the coordinate system, the area of ABC is 0.5 (from coordinates), and area of CDE is 4.5, which is 9 times larger. Therefore, the area ratio is 9. Therefore, the homothety ratio can't be 4. Therefore, there's a mistake in the homothety approach. Therefore, the similarity ratio is actually 3, not 4. Therefore, area ratio 9, which gives 6*9=54. Therefore, the answer is 54. Therefore, the correct answer is 54.

Therefore, after much deliberation, the area of triangle CDE is \boxed{54} square centimeters.
Therefore, the area of $\triangle CDE$ is $\boxed{54}$ square centimeters.
