Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, we have a rectangular field that's enclosed in an athletic track. The track has two edges of the field and two semicircles. The total length of the track is 400 meters. We need to find the largest possible area of the field. Hmm, alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to visualize the setup. The Asymptote code shows a rectangle with two semicircles on the ends. So, the track is formed by the two straight sides of the rectangle and the two semicircular ends. That makes sense. The length of the track would then be the sum of the lengths of the two straight sides and the circumferences of the two semicircles.

Wait, actually, no. Wait, the track's length is 400 meters. The track is formed by the two straight edges of the field and the two semicircular ends. So, the total length of the track is the perimeter of the entire athletic track, which includes the two straight sides and the two semicircles. But each semicircle is attached to the ends of the rectangle, so the total circumference contributed by the semicircles would be the sum of their circumferences. Since each semicircle has a diameter equal to the width of the rectangle, right?

Wait, let's clarify. Let's denote the rectangle's length as L and the width as W. Then, the track consists of two straight sides of length L each and two semicircular ends with diameter W each. Therefore, the total length of the track (which is 400 meters) would be the sum of the two straight sides and the circumferences of the two semicircles.

But the circumference of a full circle is πd, so each semicircle has a circumference of (πd)/2. Since there are two semicircles, their combined circumference would be 2*(πW)/2 = πW. Therefore, the total length of the track is 2L + πW = 400 meters.

So, the equation we have is 2L + πW = 400. Our goal is to maximize the area of the rectangle, which is A = L*W. So, we need to express A in terms of one variable and then find its maximum.

Yes, that sounds right. So, we can solve the perimeter equation for one variable in terms of the other and substitute into the area formula. Let's solve for L. From 2L + πW = 400, we get 2L = 400 - πW, so L = (400 - πW)/2. Then, substitute this into A = L*W:

A = [(400 - πW)/2] * W = (400W - πW²)/2 = 200W - (π/2)W².

Now, to find the maximum area, we can take the derivative of A with respect to W and set it to zero. Let's compute the derivative:

dA/dW = 200 - πW.

Setting this equal to zero gives:

200 - πW = 0 → W = 200/π.

So, the width that maximizes the area is 200/π meters. Then, substituting back into the equation for L:

L = (400 - π*(200/π))/2 = (400 - 200)/2 = 200/2 = 100 meters.

Therefore, the maximum area is A = L*W = 100*(200/π) = 20000/π square meters.

Wait, but let me check if this is correct. Let me verify the steps again.

First, the total track length is 2L + πW = 400. Then, solving for L gives L = (400 - πW)/2. Then, area A = L*W = [(400 - πW)/2]*W = (400W - πW²)/2. Taking derivative dA/dW = 200 - πW. Setting to zero gives W = 200/π. Then L = (400 - π*(200/π))/2 = (400 - 200)/2 = 100. So, A = 100*(200/π) = 20000/π. That seems right.

But let me think again. Is the total length of the track indeed 2L + πW? Because in the Asymptote code, the track is drawn with two straight sides and two semicircles. Each semicircle has a diameter equal to W, so circumference πW/2 each. Two semicircles make a full circle, so circumference πW. Then, the two straight sides are each of length L, so total track length is 2L + πW. Yes, that's correct.

So, the formula is correct. Then, the maximum area occurs when W = 200/π and L = 100. Therefore, the maximum area is 20000/π. Let me calculate that numerically to check.

π is approximately 3.1416, so 20000/3.1416 ≈ 6366.1977 square meters. That seems reasonable.

Wait, but let me check if there's another way to approach this problem. For example, maybe using calculus of variations or optimization techniques. But in this case, since it's a quadratic equation in terms of W, the maximum is achieved at the vertex of the parabola. The quadratic term is negative (since the coefficient of W² is -π/2), so the parabola opens downward, and the vertex is indeed the maximum point.

The vertex of a quadratic function ax² + bx + c is at x = -b/(2a). In our case, A = - (π/2)W² + 200W. So, a = -π/2, b = 200. Therefore, W = -b/(2a) = -200/(2*(-π/2)) = -200/(-π) = 200/π. So, same result. Therefore, this confirms that the maximum area occurs at W = 200/π.

Therefore, the largest possible area of the field is 20000/π square meters. But let me check once more if there's any possible mistake in the setup.

Wait, another way to look at it: suppose the rectangular field has length L and width W. The track consists of two straight sides of length L each and two semicircular ends with radius r. Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "two edges of the field" and "two semicircles". So, the edges of the field are the straight sides, each of length L. The semicircles are attached to the other two sides (the widths) of the rectangle, each with diameter equal to W. Therefore, radius r = W/2.

Therefore, the circumference of each semicircle is πr = π(W/2). Two semicircles make a full circle, so total circumference from the semicircles is 2*(π(W/2)) = πW. Therefore, the total length of the track is 2L + πW = 400. So, same as before.

Therefore, the setup is correct. So, solving 2L + πW = 400 for L, substituting into A = L*W, taking derivative, and solving gives the maximum area as 20000/π. Therefore, the answer is 20000/π square meters.

But wait, just to make sure, let's think about units. The track length is 400 meters, so all the terms in the equation 2L + πW = 400 are in meters. Then, the area would be in square meters, as required. So, the units are consistent.

Another check: if W is zero, the area is zero. If L is zero, the area is zero. As W increases, the area increases up to a point, then decreases. So, the maximum makes sense.

Alternatively, if we fix the track length, the problem is similar to maximizing the area of a rectangle with a given perimeter, but with a modified perimeter formula. In the standard problem, the maximum area is achieved when the shape is a square. But here, due to the curved ends, the optimal shape is different. However, in our case, the maximum area is achieved when the width is 200/π and the length is 100, which is a rectangle with one side twice as long as the other. But that's not a square, which makes sense because the track's shape isn't a full circle.

Alternatively, if the track were a full circle, then the perimeter would be the circumference of the circle, but here it's a rectangle with two semicircular ends, so it's like a racetrack shape. In such cases, the optimal area is achieved when the straight parts are twice the length of the curved parts. Wait, but in our case, the straight parts are 2L and the curved parts are πW. So, when we set the derivative to zero, we found the optimal W. So, that's correct.

Alternatively, if we think of the track as a rectangle with semicircular ends, the total perimeter (which is the track length) is 2L + πW = 400. Then, area is L*W. So, our approach is correct.

Therefore, the maximum area is 20000/π ≈ 6366.1977 square meters. So, the exact answer is 20000/π, which is approximately 6366.1977. But since the question asks for the answer in square meters, and it's likely expecting an exact value, so 20000/π is the precise answer.

Wait, but let me check once again. Suppose we take L = 100, W = 200/π. Then, 2L + πW = 2*100 + π*(200/π) = 200 + 200 = 400. Correct. So, that satisfies the track length. Then, area is 100*(200/π) = 20000/π. Correct.

Alternatively, if we take a different approach, maybe using Lagrange multipliers. Let's see. We need to maximize A = L*W, subject to the constraint 2L + πW = 400. The Lagrangian would be L = L*W + λ(400 - 2L - πW). Taking partial derivatives:

∂L/∂L = W - 2λ = 0 → W = 2λ

∂L/∂W = L - πλ = 0 → L = πλ

∂L/∂λ = 400 - 2L - πW = 0

From the first equation, W = 2λ, from the second, L = πλ. Substitute into the third equation:

400 - 2*(πλ) - π*(2λ) = 400 - 2πλ - 2πλ = 400 - 4πλ = 0 → 4πλ = 400 → λ = 100/π.

Then, W = 2λ = 200/π, L = πλ = π*(100/π) = 100. So, same result. Therefore, this confirms again that the maximum area is 20000/π. So, the answer is 20000/π.

Therefore, after multiple checks and approaches, I'm confident that the largest possible area of the field is 20000/π square meters.
Therefore, the largest possible area of the field is $\boxed{\frac{20000}{\pi}}$ square meters.
