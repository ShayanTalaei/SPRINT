Okay, so I need to find the value of this product of logarithms: log base 2 of 3 multiplied by log base 3 of 4, all the way up to log base 7 of 8. Hmm, let me think. I remember there's a property of logarithms that can help simplify products like this. Maybe the change of base formula? Let me recall. The change of base formula says that log_b a = log_c a / log_c b for any positive c not equal to 1. So, if I apply that here, each logarithm can be converted to a different base, which might help cancel terms when multiplied together.

Let me write out each term using the change of base formula. Let's pick a common base, say base 2, since all the logs eventually lead up to 8, which is 2 cubed. So, log_2 3 is just log base 2 of 3. Then log_3 4 would be log base 3 of 4, which can be written as log base 2 of 4 divided by log base 2 of 3. Similarly, log_4 5 would be log base 2 of 5 divided by log base 2 of 4, and so on. Let me see if this pattern continues.

So, the product would be:

log_2 3 * (log_2 4 / log_2 3) * (log_2 5 / log_2 4) * (log_2 6 / log_2 5) * (log_2 7 / log_2 6) * (log_2 8 / log_2 7)

Wait, if I write each term like that, when I multiply them all together, the denominators and numerators should cancel out, right? Let me check:

First term: log_2 3

Second term: log_2 4 / log_2 3

Third term: log_2 5 / log_2 4

Fourth term: log_2 6 / log_2 5

Fifth term: log_2 7 / log_2 6

Sixth term: log_2 8 / log_2 7

Multiplying all these together:

(log_2 3) * (log_2 4 / log_2 3) * (log_2 5 / log_2 4) * (log_2 6 / log_2 5) * (log_2 7 / log_2 6) * (log_2 8 / log_2 7)

Looking at this, each numerator cancels with the denominator of the next term. The log_2 3 in the first numerator cancels with the log_2 3 in the second denominator. Similarly, log_2 4 cancels, log_2 5 cancels, and so on until log_2 7 cancels. So, what's left is just the last numerator, which is log_2 8, and the first denominator, but wait, the first term is just log_2 3, which would cancel with the denominator of the second term. Wait, maybe I need to track this more carefully.

Let's write it step by step:

Start with log_2 3.

Multiply by log_2 4 / log_2 3. The log_2 3 cancels, leaving log_2 4.

Multiply by log_2 5 / log_2 4. The log_2 4 cancels, leaving log_2 5.

Multiply by log_2 6 / log_2 5. The log_2 5 cancels, leaving log_2 6.

Multiply by log_2 7 / log_2 6. The log_2 6 cancels, leaving log_2 7.

Multiply by log_2 8 / log_2 7. The log_2 7 cancels, leaving log_2 8.

So after multiplying all six terms, the product simplifies to log_2 8.

But log_2 8 is straightforward. Since 2^3 = 8, log_2 8 = 3. Therefore, the entire product equals 3. Wait, that seems too simple. Let me verify.

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this. The original product is a chain of logarithms where each base is the previous argument. So, log_a b * log_b c * log_c d * ... * log_y z. There's a property where this product equals log_a z. Let me confirm that.

Yes, indeed. The general property is that the product of logarithms log_a b * log_b c * log_c d * ... * log_{n-1} n equals log_a n. So in this case, starting with log_2 3 and each subsequent logarithm's base is the previous argument, so the product should be log_2 8. Which is 3, as 2^3 = 8. So that checks out.

Therefore, the value of the given product is 3. I think that's the answer. Let me just make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a mistake in the cancellation. Each step cancels out the previous term's denominator with the next term's numerator, leaving only the first denominator's base and the last numerator's. Wait, actually, in the initial terms, the first term is log_2 3, but when multiplied by the second term, which is log_2 4 divided by log_2 3, the log_2 3 cancels. Then the next term is log_2 5 divided by log_2 4, so log_2 4 cancels, and so on. So after all the multiplications, we end up with log_2 8, which is 3. Yep, that seems right.

Alternatively, if I didn't remember the property, I could have used natural logarithms to convert all the terms and see if the cancellation happens. Let's try that approach as a check.

Express each logarithm using natural logs:

log_2 3 = ln3 / ln2

log_3 4 = ln4 / ln3

log_4 5 = ln5 / ln4

log_5 6 = ln6 / ln5

log_6 7 = ln7 / ln6

log_7 8 = ln8 / ln7

Multiplying all these together:

(ln3 / ln2) * (ln4 / ln3) * (ln5 / ln4) * (ln6 / ln5) * (ln7 / ln6) * (ln8 / ln7)

Again, each numerator cancels with the denominator of the next term. The ln3 cancels, ln4 cancels, ln5 cancels, ln6 cancels, ln7 cancels. What's left is ln8 / ln2. Which is log_2 8, which is 3. So that confirms it again.

Therefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 3. I think that's solid. No steps skipped, and verified through two different approaches. So I'm confident the answer is 3.
Therefore, the value of the given expression is $\boxed{3}$.
