Okay, let's see. The problem is about thirty-five students in a math club meeting. The number of girls is a multiple of 13, and there are more girls than boys. We need to find out how many boys are at the meeting.

First, let's break down the information given. There are 35 students in total. The number of girls is a multiple of 13, which means the number of girls could be 13, 26, 39, etc. But since there are only 35 students, the number of girls can't be more than 35. So the possible multiples of 13 up to 35 are 13 and 26. Wait, 26 is also a multiple of 13 (13*2=26), but 39 is over 35, so we can ignore that.

Next, there are more girls than boys. Let's denote the number of girls as G and the number of boys as B. So, G + B = 35, and G > B. Since G is a multiple of 13, possible values are 13 or 26.

Let's check both possibilities.

First, if G = 13. Then B = 35 - 13 = 22. But here, G (13) is less than B (22), which contradicts the condition that there are more girls than boys. So this can't be the case.

Next, if G = 26. Then B = 35 - 26 = 9. Here, G (26) is greater than B (9), which satisfies the condition. So this seems to fit.

But wait, let me double-check. If there are 26 girls and 9 boys, that's 35 students total. And 26 is indeed a multiple of 13 (13*2=26). Also, 26 is more than 9, so that works. So the number of boys must be 9.

Is there any other possible multiple of 13? The next one would be 39, but 39 is larger than 35, so that's not possible. So the only possible number of girls is 26, which means 9 boys.

Therefore, the answer should be 9 boys.
