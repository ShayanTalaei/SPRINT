Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is: When the two-digit integer "AB" is cubed, the value is 912,673. We need to find A + B. 

First, I need to understand what "AB" represents. Since it's a two-digit integer, A is the tens digit and B is the units digit. So, the number AB can be written as 10*A + B. For example, if A is 3 and B is 4, the number is 34.

The problem states that when AB is cubed, the result is 912,673. So, (10A + B)^3 = 912,673. Our goal is to find the digits A and B such that this equation holds true, and then compute A + B.

Since AB is a two-digit number, its cube must be between 100^3 = 1,000,000 and 99^3 = 970,299. Wait, but the given cube is 912,673, which is less than 970,299. So, AB must be a two-digit number whose cube is 912,673. 

Hmm, but 912,673 is a six-digit number. Let me check the cube of numbers around the cube root of 912,673. Let's compute the cube root of 912,673 to approximate AB.

Cube root of 912,673. Let me estimate. 90^3 is 729,000. 100^3 is 1,000,000. So, 912,673 is between 90^3 and 100^3. Let's try 97^3. 97*97 = 9409. 9409*97. Let's compute that. 

Wait, maybe it's better to use a calculator approach here. Let's see. Let me compute 97^3:

First, 97 * 97 = 9409. Then, 9409 * 97. Let's break it down:

9409 * 100 = 940,900

Subtract 9409 * 3 = 28,227

So, 940,900 - 28,227 = 912,673. Oh! Wait, that's exactly the number given. So, 97^3 = 912,673. Therefore, AB is 97. 

So, A is 9 and B is 7. Therefore, A + B = 9 + 7 = 16.

Wait, that seems straightforward. But let me verify again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

First, confirm that 97 cubed is indeed 912,673. Let's compute 97*97:

97*97: 90*90 = 8100, 90*7*2 = 1260, 7*7 = 49. So, 8100 + 1260 + 49 = 9409. Then, 9409 * 97. Let's compute that:

9409 * 90 = 846,810

9409 * 7 = 65,863

Adding them together: 846,810 + 65,863 = 912,673. Yes, that's correct. So, AB is indeed 97. Therefore, A is 9 and B is 7. Adding them gives 16.

But wait, the problem says "the two-digit integer AB". Since AB is a two-digit number, 97 is a two-digit number. So, that fits.

Therefore, the answer should be 16. 

But let me check if there are any other two-digit numbers whose cube is 912,673. Let's see. The cube root of 912,673 is 97, as we found. So, there's no other integer between 90 and 100 that, when cubed, gives 912,673. Because 97 is the exact cube root. So, 97 is the only two-digit number in that range that satisfies the condition. 

Therefore, the answer is 16. 

But just to be thorough, let me check if maybe I miscalculated the cube of 97. Let me compute 97*97 again. 

97*97: 90*90=8100, 90*7=630, 7*90=630, 7*7=49. So, 8100 + 630 + 630 + 49 = 8100 + 1260 + 49 = 9409. Correct. Then 9409*97. Let me do this multiplication step by step. 

9409 * 90 = 9409*9*10=84,681*10=846,810

9409 * 7 = 65,863

Adding those together: 846,810 + 65,863. Let's add 846,810 + 60,000 = 906,810. Then add 5,863: 906,810 + 5,863 = 912,673. Perfect. So, the calculation is correct.

Therefore, the two-digit number AB is 97, so A + B = 9 + 7 = 16. 

I think that's solid. There's no other two-digit number near 97 that would cube to 912,673, as 96^3 would be less and 98^3 would be more. Let me check 98^3 to confirm.

98^3: 98*98 = 9,604. Then 9,604*98. Let's compute that:

9,604 * 100 = 960,400

Subtract 9,604 * 2 = 19,208

So, 960,400 - 19,208 = 941,192. That's 98^3 = 941,192, which is more than 912,673. So, 97 is indeed the correct number.

Therefore, the answer is 16. I think that's the correct solution.
Final answer: \boxed{16}
Therefore, the value of $A + B$ is $\boxed{16}$.
