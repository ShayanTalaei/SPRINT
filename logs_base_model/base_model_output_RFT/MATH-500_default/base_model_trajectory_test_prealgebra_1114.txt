Okay, so I need to find the area of the shaded triangle in the given diagram. Let me start by understanding the diagram based on the Asymptote code provided. The diagram is a rectangle with length 10 cm and width 3 cm. The corners of the rectangle are at (0,0), (10,0), (10,3), and (0,3). The shaded triangle is formed by connecting the points (0,0), (2,3), and (10,0). 

First, I should visualize this. The rectangle is 10 cm long on the x-axis and 3 cm tall on the y-axis. The triangle connects the bottom-left corner (0,0) to a point (2,3) which is near the top-left corner but 2 units to the right, and then to the bottom-right corner (10,0). So, the triangle is a bit slanted and spans the entire width of the rectangle.

To find the area of this triangle, I can use the formula for the area of a triangle given three vertices. The formula is:

Area = (1/2) |x₁(y₂ - y₃) + x₂(y₃ - y₁) + x₃(y₁ - y₂)|

Where the vertices are (x₁, y₁), (x₂, y₂), and (x₃, y₃). Let me assign the points:

Point A: (0,0)
Point B: (2,3)
Point C: (10,0)

Plugging these into the formula:

Area = (1/2) |0*(3 - 0) + 2*(0 - 0) + 10*(0 - 3)|

Let me compute each term step by step.

First term: 0*(3 - 0) = 0*3 = 0

Second term: 2*(0 - 0) = 2*0 = 0

Third term: 10*(0 - 3) = 10*(-3) = -30

Adding them up: 0 + 0 + (-30) = -30

Take the absolute value: |-30| = 30

Multiply by 1/2: (1/2)*30 = 15

So, the area should be 15 cm². Wait, but let me verify this because sometimes the order of the points matters. Let me check using another method, maybe the base and height.

Alternatively, since the triangle has vertices at (0,0), (10,0), and (2,3), maybe I can consider the base as the distance between (0,0) and (10,0), which is 10 cm. Then, the height would be the vertical distance from the point (2,3) to the base. But wait, the base is along the x-axis from (0,0) to (10,0), so the height is simply the y-coordinate of the third point, which is 3 cm. However, that would give an area of (1/2)*10*3 = 15 cm², which matches the previous result. But wait, this might not be correct because the third point is not directly above the base. Let me think again.

No, actually, if the base is along the x-axis from (0,0) to (10,0), then the height is the vertical distance from the third point (2,3) to this base. The base is along the line y=0, so the height is indeed 3 cm. Therefore, the area is (1/2)*10*3 = 15 cm². That seems straightforward.

But wait, why did the first method with the coordinates give the same answer? Maybe I was confused, but both methods give 15 cm². However, let me check if the third point is directly above the base. Wait, no, the base is from (0,0) to (10,0), and the third point is (2,3). So, the height is the perpendicular distance from (2,3) to the base. The base is along y=0, so the perpendicular distance is just the y-coordinate of the point, which is 3 cm. So yes, the area is (1/2)*10*3 = 15 cm². So that seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe using vectors or coordinate geometry. Let's try the shoelace formula again, just to confirm.

Shoelace formula:

List the coordinates in order: (0,0), (2,3), (10,0), and back to (0,0).

Compute the sum of x_i * y_{i+1}:

0*3 + 2*0 + 10*0 = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0

Compute the sum of y_i * x_{i+1}:

0*2 + 3*10 + 0*0 = 0 + 30 + 0 = 30

Subtract the two sums: |0 - 30| = 30

Area = 1/2 * 30 = 15 cm². Same result.

So, three different methods give me 15 cm². That seems solid. But wait, let me check the Asymptote code again. The rectangle is drawn from (0,0) to (10,0) to (10,3) to (0,3). Then, the triangle is drawn from (0,0) to (2,3) to (10,0). The labels mention "10 cm" on the top and bottom sides, which are 10 cm each, and "3 cm" on the left and right sides, which are 3 cm each. So, that matches the coordinates given. So, the diagram is consistent with the coordinates. Therefore, the area should indeed be 15 cm².

Wait, but I just thought of another way. Maybe using coordinates to find the vectors and compute the area with the cross product. Let's try that.

Vector AB is from (0,0) to (2,3): (2,3)

Vector AC is from (0,0) to (10,0): (10,0)

The area is (1/2) |AB × AC| = (1/2) |2*0 - 3*10| = (1/2)|0 - 30| = 15 cm². Yep, same answer.

Alternatively, if I use vectors BA and BC. Wait, maybe that's more complicated. But regardless, all methods point to 15 cm².

But wait, hold on. Let me make sure that the triangle is not degenerate or something. The points (0,0), (2,3), and (10,0) are not colinear. Let me check if they are. The slope from (0,0) to (2,3) is (3-0)/(2-0) = 3/2. The slope from (2,3) to (10,0) is (0-3)/(10-2) = (-3)/8. Since the slopes are different, the points are not colinear, so the triangle is valid.

Alternatively, compute the area using coordinates again. Let's list all three points:

A(0,0), B(2,3), C(10,0)

Using the formula:

Area = 1/2 | (x_A(y_B - y_C) + x_B(y_C - y_A) + x_C(y_A - y_B)) |

Plug in:

1/2 | 0*(3 - 0) + 2*(0 - 0) + 10*(0 - 3) | = 1/2 | 0 + 0 -30 | = 1/2 *30=15. Yep.

So, all methods confirm that the area is 15 cm². Therefore, the answer should be 15 cm².
Therefore, the area of the shaded triangle is $\boxed{15}$ cm².
