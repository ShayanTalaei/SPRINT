Okay, so I need to figure out what kind of graph the equation \(\left(\frac{x}{2} - 3\right)^2 + y^2 = 10\) represents. The options are parabola, circle, ellipse, hyperbola, point, line, two lines, or empty. Let me start by recalling the standard forms of these conic sections and see if this equation matches any of them.

First, the equation given is \(\left(\frac{x}{2} - 3\right)^2 + y^2 = 10\). Let me rewrite this to make it look more familiar. Maybe expanding the terms would help. Let's see, \(\frac{x}{2} - 3\) can be rewritten as \(\frac{x - 6}{2}\). So, squaring that would be \(\left(\frac{x - 6}{2}\right)^2\), which is \(\frac{(x - 6)^2}{4}\). So the equation becomes \(\frac{(x - 6)^2}{4} + y^2 = 10\).

Hmm, that looks like the standard form of an ellipse. The standard form of an ellipse is \(\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} + \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1\), where (h, k) is the center, and a and b are the lengths of the semi-major and semi-minor axes. But in this case, the right-hand side of the equation is 10, not 1. So maybe I need to divide both sides by 10 to get it into the standard form?

Let me try that. Dividing both sides by 10 gives \(\frac{(x - 6)^2}{40} + \frac{y^2}{10} = 1\). Now, this looks like an ellipse because both terms are positive and added together. The denominators under x and y terms are 40 and 10, respectively. So the center of the ellipse would be at (6, 0), since in the standard form, the center is (h, k). The semi-major axis length would be \(\sqrt{40}\), which is \(2\sqrt{10}\), and the semi-minor axis length would be \(\sqrt{10}\).

Wait, but let me check if there are any other possibilities. Could this equation represent a circle? A circle is a special case of an ellipse where the denominators under x and y terms are equal. Here, 40 and 10 are not equal, so it's not a circle. Parabola? No, because the equation has two squared terms added together. Hyperbola is when there's a subtraction, so that's not the case here. Point or lines? Well, if the right-hand side were zero, it might represent a single point or lines, but since it's 10, that's definitely not the case. And it's not empty because the right-hand side is positive, so there are real solutions.

Therefore, the graph should be an ellipse centered at (6, 0) with the major axis along the x-axis. Let me confirm this by checking the standard form again. The original equation after simplifying is \(\frac{(x - 6)^2}{40} + \frac{y^2}{10} = 1\), which is indeed an ellipse. So yes, the answer should be an ellipse.
