Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking to convert the bicycle's speed from feet per minute to inches per second. Hmm, units conversion can sometimes be tricky, but let's break it down.

First, I need to remember how to convert between different units. The current speed is given in feet per minute, and we need to convert it to inches per second. So, we'll need to convert feet to inches and minutes to seconds.

Starting with the feet to inches part. I know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches. So, if the bicycle is moving 20 feet per minute, that's 20 times 12 inches per minute. Let me calculate that: 20 * 12 = 240. So, 240 inches per minute.

Now, we need to convert minutes to seconds. There are 60 seconds in a minute. So, we have 240 inches per minute, and we want to find out how many inches that is per second. To convert per minute to per second, we divide by 60. So, 240 divided by 60 equals 4. Therefore, the speed is 4 inches per second.

Wait, let me double-check that. 20 feet per minute times 12 inches per foot gives 240 inches per minute. Then dividing by 60 seconds gives 4 inches per second. That seems right.

Alternatively, maybe I can do the conversion factor approach. Let's see. The conversion factor from feet to inches is 12, and from minutes to seconds is 60. So, the overall conversion factor would be (12 inches/1 foot) * (1 minute/60 seconds). Multiplying that with the original speed: 20 feet/minute * (12 inches/1 foot) * (1 minute/60 seconds). The feet and minutes units cancel out, leaving inches per second. Calculating the numbers: 20 * 12 = 240, divided by 60 is 4. Yep, same result.

Another way to think about it: 20 feet per minute. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 20 feet per minute is 20*60 feet per hour, but wait, that's not necessary here. We just need per second. So, 20 feet per minute divided by 60 gives 1/3 foot per second. Then convert 1/3 foot to inches: 1/3 *12 = 4 inches per second. Oh, that's another way. So, 20 divided by 60 is 1/3 foot per second, times 12 inches per foot is 4 inches per second. All methods lead to the same answer. That makes me confident it's correct.

I don't see any mistakes here. The key steps are converting feet to inches and minutes to seconds, making sure the units cancel properly. All the multiplication and division steps check out. So, the final answer should be 4 inches per second.
