Okay, let's try to figure out how many ways the Senate committee can sit around a circular table with the condition that all members of each party sit next to each other. Hmm, so there are 5 Democrats, 5 Republicans, and 1 Independent. That's a total of 11 people. Wait, but the problem says all the members of each party must sit next to each other. So does that mean each party forms a block, and these blocks are arranged around the table? Let me think.

First, since it's a circular table, the number of arrangements is usually (n-1)! for n people because rotations are considered the same. But here, the people are grouped into blocks, so maybe we need to treat each party as a single block first and then consider the permutations within each block.

So there are three parties: Democrats, Republicans, and Independent. Each party is a block. So we have three blocks around the table. Since it's a circular table, the number of ways to arrange these three blocks is (3-1)! = 2! = 2. That's because for circular arrangements, fixing one block and arranging the others relative to it. So the blocks can be arranged in two different ways: Democrat-Republican-Independent or Republican-Democrat-Independent, etc., but since it's circular, those two are the only distinct arrangements.

But wait, each block has multiple people. The Democrats have 5 members, Republicans 5, and Independent 1. So within each block, the members can be arranged in different ways. For the Democrats, the number of ways to arrange 5 people is 5! Similarly for the Republicans, 5! And the Independent is just 1, so 1 way.

Therefore, the total number of arrangements should be the number of ways to arrange the blocks multiplied by the number of ways to arrange the people within each block. So that would be 2! (for the blocks) multiplied by 5! (Democrats) multiplied by 5! (Republicans) multiplied by 1! (Independent). Let me check that.

Wait, but hold on. Since the table is circular, and we fixed the position of one block to avoid counting rotations as different arrangements. So by fixing one block, say the Democrats, then arranging the other two blocks relative to them. So the number of ways to arrange the blocks would be 2! as before. Then within each block, permutations. So yes, 2! * 5! * 5! * 1!.

But let me verify if there's anything else to consider. For example, is the Independent person considered a separate block? Yes, because the problem states that all members of each party must sit next to each other. Since there's only one Independent, they form a block of one. So yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, if we didn't fix a block, but considered the circular arrangement, the formula would be (number of arrangements of blocks - 1)! multiplied by the permutations within each block. So since there are 3 blocks, the formula would be (3-1)! * 5! * 5! * 1! = 2! * 120 * 120 * 1 = 2 * 120 * 120 = 28,800.

But let me think again. Suppose we didn't fix any block. The total number of circular arrangements where the blocks are considered as single entities would be (3-1)! = 2. Then within each block, the people can be arranged in 5!, 5!, and 1! ways. So multiplying those together gives 2 * 5! * 5! * 1! = 2 * 120 * 120 = 28,800. That seems right.

Alternatively, if we treated the entire group as a circular permutation with blocks, then yes, that's the standard formula. So the answer should be 28,800. Let me check if there's any mistake here.

Wait, but sometimes in circular permutations, if the blocks are indistinct, but in this case, the blocks are distinct because they are different parties. So the arrangement of the blocks matters. For example, Democrat block next to Republican block is different from Republican block next to Democrat block, but since it's a circle, those two are actually the same if you can rotate the table. Wait, no. Wait, the blocks are distinguishable because they are different parties. So when we fix the position of one block, the arrangement of the others relative to it can be clockwise or counter-clockwise. So that's why the formula is (number of blocks - 1)! because circular permutations for distinguishable blocks. Wait, actually, I think the formula for circular permutations of distinguishable objects is (n-1)! when the objects are distinguishable. But in this case, the blocks are distinguishable, so yes, (3-1)! = 2! = 2.

Therefore, the total number is 2! * 5! * 5! * 1! = 2 * 120 * 120 * 1 = 28,800. That seems correct.

But let me think again. Suppose we have three blocks: D, R, I. Then in a circular arrangement, the number of distinct arrangements is 2! because fixing one block, say D, then the other two blocks can be arranged in 2! ways: R then I, or I then R. Each of these corresponds to different seatings because the parties are different. So if we fix D, then R next to D on one side and I on the other, or I next to D on one side and R on the other. Since the table is circular, these two are distinct because the parties are different. So yes, 2! arrangements.

Then within each block, the people can be arranged. For D, 5! ways; for R, 5! ways; and for I, 1 way. So multiplying all together gives 2 * 5! * 5! = 2 * 120 * 120 = 28,800.

Therefore, the answer should be 28,800. I think that's correct. Let me check if there's any other factor I might have missed. For example, if the table had a fixed position, like a head of table, then the number would be different, but since it's a circular table with rotations considered the same, we use the circular permutation formula.

Yes, I think that's right. So final answer is 28,800.
Therefore, the number of ways the Senate committee can sit around a circular table, with all members of each party sitting next to each other, considering rotations as equivalent, is $\boxed{28800}$.
