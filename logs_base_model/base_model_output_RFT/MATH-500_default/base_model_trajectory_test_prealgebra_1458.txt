Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking: What fraction of 2 feet is 3 inches? And we need to express the answer as a common fraction. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to make sure both measurements are in the same unit. The question gives us 2 feet and 3 inches. Since feet and inches are different units, I should convert one to the other to have a common base. Let me recall that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches. So, if I convert 2 feet into inches, that should help.

Calculating 2 feet in inches: 2 feet * 12 inches/foot = 24 inches. So, 2 feet is equivalent to 24 inches. Now, the problem is asking what fraction 3 inches is of 24 inches. That makes sense because once both are in inches, we can form the fraction.

So, the fraction would be 3 inches divided by 24 inches. Let me write that down: 3/24. Now, I need to simplify this fraction to its lowest terms. To do that, I should find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 3 and 24. The factors of 3 are 1 and 3, and the factors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. The common factors are 1 and 3, so the GCD is 3.

Dividing both numerator and denominator by 3: 3 รท 3 = 1, and 24 รท 3 = 8. So, the simplified fraction is 1/8. Therefore, 3 inches is 1/8 of 2 feet.

Wait a second, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with converting feet to inches: 2 feet * 12 inches/foot = 24 inches. That seems correct. Then, forming the fraction 3/24. Yes, that's right. Simplifying by dividing numerator and denominator by 3 gives 1/8. That all checks out. Hmm, I think that's solid.

Alternatively, maybe I can approach it by converting 3 inches into feet instead. Let's see if that gives the same result. Since 1 inch is 1/12 of a foot, 3 inches would be 3*(1/12) feet = 3/12 feet = 1/4 feet. Then, the question is asking what fraction 1/4 feet is of 2 feet. So, (1/4)/2 = (1/4)*(1/2) = 1/8. Yep, same answer. So that confirms it.

Another way to think about it: If 2 feet is the whole, then 3 inches is a part of that whole. Since 3 inches is a smaller unit, the fraction should be less than 1. 1/8 is 0.125, which is less than 1, so that makes sense. Alternatively, if I think in terms of proportions: 3 inches is to 2 feet as x is to 1. So, 3/24 = x/1, solving for x gives x = 1/8. All methods converge to the same answer, so I feel confident that 1/8 is correct.

Just to recap in a different way: If 1 foot is 12 inches, then 2 feet is 24 inches. So, 3 inches is 3/24 of the total length. 3 divided by 24 is 1/8. Yep. That's straightforward. No complicated steps here. The key was converting both measurements to the same unit before forming the fraction. Once that's done, simplifying the fraction gives the answer.
Therefore, the fraction of 2 feet that is 3 inches is $\boxed{\frac{1}{8}}$.
