Okay, let's see. The problem is asking for the positive square root of the product 10 multiplied by 15 multiplied by 24. Hmm, so first I need to calculate that product, right? Then take the square root of the result. Let me start by figuring out the product step by step.

First, multiplying 10 and 15. 10 times 15 is straightforward. 10*15 is 150. Then I need to multiply that result by 24. So 150*24. Hmm, let me compute that. 150 times 20 is 3000, and 150 times 4 is 600. Adding those together gives 3000 + 600 = 3600. Wait, so the product is 3600. Now, the square root of 3600. That should be a nice whole number, right? Let me recall, 60 squared is 3600 because 60*60 is 3600. So the square root of 3600 is 60. Therefore, the positive square root is 60. Let me just verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First step: 10*15=150. Correct. Then 150*24. Breaking it down, 150*20=3000 and 150*4=600. Adding those gives 3600. Yep. Then sqrt(3600)=60. All steps check out. So the answer should be 60. I think that's it.
