Okay, let's see. The question is asking for the value of a + b + m, where a is the x-intercept, b is the y-intercept, and m is the slope of the line given by the equation x/4 + y/12 = 1. Hmm, right. So I need to find each of these three values and then add them together. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the x-intercept. The x-intercept is the point where the line crosses the x-axis. At that point, the y-coordinate is 0. So to find a, I can set y to 0 in the equation and solve for x. Let me do that.

Given the equation x/4 + y/12 = 1, if y = 0, then x/4 = 1. Solving for x, multiply both sides by 4, so x = 4. Therefore, the x-intercept a is 4. That seems straightforward.

Next, the y-intercept. The y-intercept is where the line crosses the y-axis, so the x-coordinate is 0 there. So set x = 0 in the equation and solve for y. Let's do that.

Plugging x = 0 into x/4 + y/12 = 1 gives 0 + y/12 = 1. So y/12 = 1, which means y = 12. Therefore, the y-intercept b is 12. That makes sense.

Now, the slope m. The equation given is in standard form, which is x/a + y/b = 1. But usually, the slope-intercept form is y = mx + c, where m is the slope. Maybe I should convert the given equation into slope-intercept form to find the slope. Let me try that.

Starting with x/4 + y/12 = 1. Let me subtract x/4 from both sides to get y/12 = -x/4 + 1. Then multiply both sides by 12 to solve for y. So y = (-x/4)*12 + 12. Simplifying that, -x/4 *12 is -3x, so y = -3x + 12. Therefore, the slope m is -3. Wait, is that right? Let me check again.

Original equation: x/4 + y/12 = 1. Yes, solving for y: y/12 = -x/4 + 1. Multiply both sides by 12: y = -3x + 12. So slope m is -3. That seems correct.

Alternatively, I remember that the slope of a line in standard form Ax + By = C is -A/B. Let me confirm that. The standard form is Ax + By = C, so slope is -A/B. In our equation, if we rearrange it to standard form, it's (1/4)x + (1/12)y = 1. Wait, but the standard form is usually written as Ax + By = C where A, B, C are integers. So maybe to make it easier, multiply both sides by 12 to eliminate denominators. Let's do that.

Original equation: x/4 + y/12 = 1. Multiply all terms by 12: 3x + y = 12. So 3x + y = 12. Then, solving for y: y = -3x + 12. So the slope is indeed -3. Yep, that's consistent. So m = -3.

So now, we have a = 4, b = 12, and m = -3. Adding them together: 4 + 12 + (-3) = 4 + 12 is 16, minus 3 is 13. So the sum is 13. Let me just verify once more to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

X-intercept: Set y=0, x/4 = 1 => x=4. Correct. Y-intercept: Set x=0, y/12 =1 => y=12. Correct. Slope: Converted to slope-intercept form and got -3. Correct. Sum: 4+12-3=13. Seems right. I don't see any errors here.

Another way to check the slope: The standard form Ax + By = C has slope -A/B. In the equation 3x + y = 12, A is 3, B is 1. So slope is -3/1 = -3. Yep, that's the same. So that's correct.

Alternatively, using the formula for slope between two intercepts. The two intercepts are (a, 0) and (0, b). The slope is (b - 0)/(0 - a) = -b/a. Here, a=4, b=12. So slope would be -12/4 = -3. That's another way to confirm. So that's consistent. So slope is indeed -3.

Therefore, all values are correct. Adding them up: 4 +12 + (-3) = 13. So the final answer is 13.
Therefore, the value of $a + b + m$ is $\boxed{13}$.
