Okay, so I need to find the quotient when x^9 + 1 is divided by x - 1. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this. I remember that when you divide a polynomial by a binomial like x - a, the remainder is the value of the polynomial evaluated at x = a. That's the Remainder Theorem. But here, the question isn't just asking for the remainder; it's asking for the quotient. So maybe I need to perform polynomial long division?

Alternatively, maybe there's a shortcut using the fact that x^9 + 1 can be factored. Let me recall that x^n + 1 can sometimes be factored, especially when n is odd. Since 9 is odd, x^9 + 1 can be written as (x + 1)(x^8 - x^7 + x^6 - x^5 + x^4 - x^3 + x^2 - x + 1). Wait, is that right? Let me check by multiplying (x + 1) by that polynomial. Let's do it step by step:

First term: x * x^8 = x^9

Then x * (-x^7) = -x^8

x * x^6 = x^7

x * (-x^5) = -x^6

x * x^4 = x^5

x * (-x^3) = -x^4

x * x^2 = x^3

x * (-x) = -x^2

x * 1 = x

Then the +1 times each term in the second polynomial:

1 * x^8 = x^8

1 * (-x^7) = -x^7

1 * x^6 = x^6

1 * (-x^5) = -x^5

1 * x^4 = x^4

1 * (-x^3) = -x^3

1 * x^2 = x^2

1 * (-x) = -x

1 * 1 = 1

Now, adding all these terms together:

x^9 + (-x^8 + x^8) + (x^7 - x^7) + (-x^6 + x^6) + (x^5 - x^5) + (-x^4 + x^4) + (x^3 - x^3) + (-x^2 + x^2) + (x - x) + 1

Each pair cancels out except for x^9 and 1. So yes, x^9 + 1 factors into (x + 1)(x^8 - x^7 + x^6 - x^5 + x^4 - x^3 + x^2 - x + 1). Therefore, if we divide x^9 + 1 by x - 1, it's equivalent to dividing (x + 1)(x^8 - x^7 + x^6 - x^5 + x^4 - x^3 + x^2 - x + 1) by x - 1. But wait, x - 1 is not a factor here. Hmm, maybe this factoring isn't directly helpful?

Alternatively, maybe I can use polynomial long division. Let's try that. Dividing x^9 + 1 by x - 1.

First, set up the division: x^9 ÷ x gives x^8. Multiply (x - 1) by x^8: x^9 - x^8. Subtract that from the original polynomial:

(x^9 + 0x^8 + 0x^7 + ... + 0x + 1) - (x^9 - x^8) = 0x^9 + x^8 + 0x^7 + ... + 0x + 1.

Now, bring down the terms, but since we just did the subtraction, the next term is x^8. Divide x^8 by x, which is x^7. Multiply (x - 1) by x^7: x^8 - x^7. Subtract that:

(x^8 + 0x^7 + ...) - (x^8 - x^7) = 0x^8 + x^7 + 0x^6 + ... + 0x + 1.

Continue this process. Each time, the degree of the remainder decreases by 1. So the quotient will be x^8 + x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1, and the remainder will be 1 + (x - 1)*(something). Wait, but when I divide by x - 1, the remainder should be the value at x = 1. Let's check: x^9 + 1 evaluated at x = 1 is 1 + 1 = 2. But if I use the division result, the remainder is the constant term after division. Let me see:

If I perform the division step by step:

1. Divide x^9 by x: x^8. Multiply (x - 1) by x^8: x^9 - x^8. Subtract: x^8.

2. Divide x^8 by x: x^7. Multiply (x - 1) by x^7: x^8 - x^7. Subtract: x^7.

3. Continue this until:

After 9 steps, you would have divided x^9 by x^0 (since the divisor is degree 1), so the quotient terms would be x^8, x^7, ..., x^0. Wait, but that can't be right because the original polynomial is x^9 + 1, which is degree 9, and the divisor is degree 1, so the quotient should be degree 8. But when I subtract x^9 - x^8, I get x^8. Then divide x^8 by x to get x^7, multiply back, subtract, get x^7, and so on. Each step reduces the degree by 1. So after 8 steps, the remainder would be 1. Let's check:

After dividing x^9 by x - 1, the quotient is x^8 + x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1, and the remainder is 1. Wait, but when you plug x = 1 into x^9 + 1, you get 2, but according to the division, the remainder is 1. That's a discrepancy. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, let's verify with x = 1. If I plug x = 1 into the divisor x - 1, it's 0, so the Remainder Theorem says the remainder should be f(1) = 1^9 + 1 = 2. But according to the division process, the remainder is 1. That's conflicting. Therefore, my polynomial division steps must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps I missed a term. Let's try the division again more carefully. Let's use the standard polynomial long division.

Dividend: x^9 + 0x^8 + 0x^7 + 0x^6 + 0x^5 + 0x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x + 1

Divisor: x - 1

First term: x^9 ÷ x = x^8. Multiply divisor by x^8: x^9 - x^8. Subtract from dividend:

(x^9 + 0x^8 + ...) - (x^9 - x^8) = 0x^9 + x^8 + 0x^7 + ... + 0x + 1.

Next term: x^8 ÷ x = x^7. Multiply divisor by x^7: x^8 - x^7. Subtract:

(x^8 + 0x^7 + ...) - (x^8 - x^7) = 0x^8 + x^7 + 0x^6 + ... + 0x + 1.

Next term: x^7 ÷ x = x^6. Multiply divisor by x^6: x^7 - x^6. Subtract:

(x^7 + 0x^6 + ...) - (x^7 - x^6) = 0x^7 + x^6 + 0x^5 + ... + 0x + 1.

Continuing this pattern, each time the degree decreases by 1, the coefficient is 1, and the remainder is x^n + 0x^(n-1) + ... + 0x + 1. After performing this 8 times, the last term would be x^1 ÷ x = 1. Multiply divisor by 1: x - 1. Subtract:

(x + 0) - (x - 1) = 0x + 1. So the remainder is 1.

But according to the Remainder Theorem, the remainder should be f(1) = 1^9 + 1 = 2. There's a contradiction here. So where's the mistake?

Wait, maybe the original polynomial is x^9 + 1, but when I perform the division, the remainder is 1? That can't be. Let me check with a simpler case. Let's divide x^2 + 1 by x - 1. The remainder should be f(1) = 1 + 1 = 2. Let's do the division:

Dividend: x^2 + 0x + 1

Divisor: x - 1

First term: x^2 ÷ x = x. Multiply divisor by x: x^2 - x. Subtract: (x^2 + 0x + 1) - (x^2 - x) = 0x^2 + x + 1.

Next term: x ÷ x = 1. Multiply divisor by 1: x - 1. Subtract: (x + 1) - (x - 1) = 0x + 2. So remainder is 2, which matches f(1) = 2. So in this case, the remainder is correct.

But in the case of x^9 + 1, according to the division, the remainder is 1, but according to the Remainder Theorem, it's 2. So there's a discrepancy. Therefore, my polynomial division must be incorrect.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the subtraction steps. Let's try dividing x^9 + 1 by x - 1 again, but this time, after each step, check the remainder.

Alternatively, maybe using synthetic division would be easier. Let's try that.

For synthetic division with x = 1 (since divisor is x - 1), set up coefficients of the dividend x^9 + 0x^8 + 0x^7 + ... + 0x + 1. So coefficients are 1 (x^9), 0 (x^8), 0 (x^7), ..., 0 (x^1), 1 (constant term).

Bring down the leading coefficient: 1.

Multiply by 1 (the root): 1 * 1 = 1. Add to the next coefficient: 0 + 1 = 1.

Multiply by 1: 1 * 1 = 1. Add to next coefficient: 0 + 1 = 1.

Continue this process for all coefficients:

1 (x^9)

1 (x^8)

1 (x^7)

1 (x^6)

1 (x^5)

1 (x^4)

1 (x^3)

1 (x^2)

1 (x)

1 (constant)

After all coefficients are processed, the last number is the remainder, which is 1. But according to Remainder Theorem, it should be 2. Therefore, something is wrong here.

Wait, maybe the original polynomial is x^9 + 1, but when I set up synthetic division, I need to include all coefficients from x^9 down to the constant term. Let me list them:

x^9: 1

x^8: 0

x^7: 0

x^6: 0

x^5: 0

x^4: 0

x^3: 0

x^2: 0

x^1: 0

x^0: 1

So there are 10 coefficients. Let's do synthetic division step by step:

Start with 1 (from x^9).

Bring down 1.

Multiply by 1: 1. Add to next coefficient (0): 1.

Multiply by 1: 1. Add to next coefficient (0): 1.

Continue this until the last coefficient:

After 9 steps, the numbers are:

1 (x^9)

1 (x^8)

1 (x^7)

1 (x^6)

1 (x^5)

1 (x^4)

1 (x^3)

1 (x^2)

1 (x^1)

1 (constant)

So the remainder is 1. But according to the Remainder Theorem, it should be 2. Therefore, there's a contradiction. This suggests that either the Remainder Theorem is wrong (which it's not) or the division is incorrect. Wait, but synthetic division is a proven method. Therefore, the mistake must be elsewhere.

Wait, maybe the original problem was to divide x^9 + 1 by x - 1, but when I use synthetic division, the remainder is 1, which contradicts x^9 + 1 evaluated at x=1 is 2. Therefore, there's a mistake in my synthetic division steps.

Wait, let's check synthetic division again. Let me write it out step by step.

Coefficients: 1 (x^9), 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.

Bring down the 1.

Multiply by 1: 1. Add to next coefficient (0): 1.

Multiply by 1: 1. Add to next coefficient (0): 1.

Multiply by 1: 1. Add to next coefficient (0): 1.

Multiply by 1: 1. Add to next coefficient (0): 1.

Multiply by 1: 1. Add to next coefficient (0): 1.

Multiply by 1: 1. Add to next coefficient (0): 1.

Multiply by 1: 1. Add to next coefficient (0): 1.

Multiply by 1: 1. Add to next coefficient (0): 1.

Multiply by 1: 1. Add to last coefficient (1): 2.

Ah! There we go. The last step: after multiplying the previous 1 by 1, we add to the last coefficient (1), giving 2. So the remainder is 2, which matches the Remainder Theorem. So my mistake earlier was stopping too early. There are 10 coefficients, so after processing all 9 coefficients after the first, we have the 10th step which adds to the last coefficient. So the remainder is indeed 2. Therefore, the quotient is the coefficients we've obtained: 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, with the remainder 2. Therefore, the quotient is x^8 + x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1, and the remainder is 2. So the division result is:

(x^9 + 1) = (x - 1)(x^8 + x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1) + 2.

But the question is to find the quotient when x^9 + 1 is divided by x - 1. So the quotient is x^8 + x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1, and the remainder is 2. Therefore, the answer is that quotient.

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to find the quotient without performing the entire division. Let's think. If we have f(x) = x^9 + 1 divided by x - 1, then f(x) = (x - 1)Q(x) + R, where R is the remainder. Since R = f(1) = 2, we can write Q(x) = (f(x) - R)/(x - 1). But that might not help directly.

Alternatively, notice that x^9 + 1 can be written as (x^10 - 1)/(x - 1) if x ≠ 1. Wait, because x^10 - 1 = (x - 1)(x^9 + x^8 + ... + x + 1). But here, we have x^9 + 1. Hmm, not quite the same. Let's see:

x^9 + 1 = x^9 + 1. If we factor x^9 + 1, since 9 is odd, it factors as (x + 1)(x^8 - x^7 + x^6 - ... + 1). But as before, dividing by x - 1 is different. Alternatively, maybe write x^9 + 1 as x^9 - (-1)^9. Since (-1)^9 = -1, so x^9 - (-1)^9 = x^9 + 1. Then using the formula for difference of powers: x^n - a^n = (x - a)(x^{n-1} + x^{n-2}a + ... + a^{n-1}). Here, a = -1, n = 9. So x^9 - (-1)^9 = (x - (-1))(x^8 + x^7(-1) + x^6(-1)^2 + ... + (-1)^8). Simplify:

(x + 1)(x^8 - x^7 + x^6 - x^5 + x^4 - x^3 + x^2 - x + 1). So that's the factorization. Therefore, if we divide x^9 + 1 by x - 1, it's equivalent to dividing (x + 1)(x^8 - x^7 + x^6 - x^5 + x^4 - x^3 + x^2 - x + 1) by x - 1. But x - 1 is not a factor here, so the division won't simplify further. Therefore, the quotient would be (x + 1)(x^8 - x^7 + x^6 - x^5 + x^4 - x^3 + x^2 - x + 1) divided by x - 1. But this seems more complicated. Alternatively, maybe perform polynomial division on the expanded factors, but that might not be helpful.

Alternatively, consider that x^9 + 1 divided by x - 1 can be expressed as the sum of a geometric series. Let me think. If I write x^9 + 1 as 1 + x + x^2 + ... + x^9 minus (x + x^2 + ... + x^9). Wait, no. Alternatively, note that (x - 1)(x^8 + x^7 + ... + x + 1) = x^9 - 1. Therefore, x^9 + 1 = (x^9 - 1) + 2 = (x - 1)(x^8 + x^7 + ... + x + 1) + 2. Therefore, dividing x^9 + 1 by x - 1 gives the quotient (x^8 + x^7 + ... + x + 1) and remainder 2. Therefore, the quotient is x^8 + x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1.

Therefore, the answer is the sum of x^8 down to x^0, which is a geometric series with common ratio x, eight terms. Wait, no, it's nine terms, from x^8 to x^0. Wait, x^8 + x^7 + ... + x + 1 is indeed a geometric series with nine terms. The sum of a geometric series is (x^9 - 1)/(x - 1). But here, we have (x^9 + 1)/(x - 1) = (x^9 - 1)/(x - 1) + 2/(x - 1). But that's not helpful for the quotient. Wait, but earlier we established that x^9 + 1 = (x - 1)(quotient) + 2. Therefore, the quotient is (x^9 + 1 - 2)/(x - 1) = (x^9 - 1)/(x - 1) = x^8 + x^7 + ... + x + 1. Therefore, the quotient is that sum.

Therefore, the answer is x^8 + x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1.

So to confirm, using synthetic division, the quotient is indeed that polynomial, and the remainder is 2. Therefore, the quotient when x^9 + 1 is divided by x - 1 is x^8 + x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1.

**Final Answer**
The quotient is \boxed{x^8 + x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1}.
Therefore, the quotient when $x^9 + 1$ is divided by $x - 1$ is $\boxed{x^8 + x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1}$.
