Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, there are three types of creatures here: treeks, squigs, and goolees. We need to find out how many treeks equal the weight of one squig. Hmm, okay, let's parse the problem step by step.

First, the problem states two things:

1. Ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee. So, 10 treeks = 3 squigs + 1 goolee.
2. Two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig. So, 2 treeks + 1 goolee = 1 squig.

And we need to find how many treeks equal one squig. Let's assign variables to each creature's weight. Let me denote:

Let t = weight of one treek,
s = weight of one squig,
g = weight of one goolee.

Now, translating the given information into equations:

From the first statement: 10t = 3s + g. (Equation 1)
From the second statement: 2t + g = s. (Equation 2)

Our goal is to find the value of s in terms of t, or maybe express s in terms of t so we can find how many treeks equal a squig. Wait, actually, we need to find how many treeks equal one squig. So, we need to find the number of treeks (let's say x) such that x*t = s. So, x = s/t. So, once we find s in terms of t, we can divide by t to get x.

So, let's work with the two equations. Let's see. Equation 2 is 2t + g = s. So, we can express g in terms of s and t: g = s - 2t. Then substitute this into Equation 1.

Equation 1: 10t = 3s + g. Substitute g with (s - 2t):

10t = 3s + (s - 2t)
10t = 4s - 2t
Now, bring the 2t to the left side:

10t + 2t = 4s
12t = 4s
Divide both sides by 4:

3t = s

So, s = 3t. That means one squig weighs as much as three treeks. Therefore, the combined weight of three treeks equals the weight of one squig. So, the answer should be 3 treeks. Wait, but let me check this again to make sure.

Wait, if s = 3t, then x*t = s implies x*t = 3t, so x = 3. That seems straightforward. But let me verify with the original equations to ensure there's no mistake.

Let's substitute s = 3t into Equation 2: 2t + g = 3t. So, g = 3t - 2t = t. So, g = t. Then, substitute into Equation 1: 10t = 3s + g. Since s = 3t and g = t, 3s + g = 3*(3t) + t = 9t + t = 10t. Which matches the first equation. So, that's correct.

Therefore, the answer is 3 treeks. But let me just think again if there's any other way this could be interpreted. The problem says "the combined weight of how many treeks equals the weight of one squig." Since s = 3t, that's exactly 3 treeks. So, yes, that seems right.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is trying to trick us with the units, but I don't see how. The variables are straightforward: t, s, g as weights. So, unless there's a trick in the way the problem is phrased, which I don't think there is, the answer should be 3.

Just to recap:

- Converted the problem into equations.
- Solved the system of equations.
- Verified the solution by plugging back into original equations.
- Checked the logic step by step.

Everything checks out. So, I'm confident the answer is 3.
Therefore, the combined weight of $\boxed{3}$ treeks equals the weight of one squig.
