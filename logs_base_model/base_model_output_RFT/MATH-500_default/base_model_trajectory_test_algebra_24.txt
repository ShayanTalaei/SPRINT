Okay, let's see. The problem is about finding out how many calories make up a person's daily caloric requirement. The information given is that a snack-size tin of peaches has 40 calories, and that's 2% of their daily requirement. Hmm, so I need to figure out what 100% would be if 2% is 40 calories. 

First, maybe I can think of it in terms of percentages. If 2% equals 40 calories, then 1% would be half of that, right? Because 1% is 2% divided by 2. So, 40 calories divided by 2 would give me the calories for 1%. Let me check that. 40 divided by 2 is 20. So, 1% is 20 calories. Then, to get 100%, I just multiply 20 by 100. That should give me the total daily calories. So, 20 times 100 is 2000. Wait, 2000 calories a day? That seems really high. Is that right?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. If 2% is 40 calories, then 1% is 20, and 100% is 2000. But 2000 calories a day is way more than the recommended daily intake. Typically, the average recommended daily caloric intake is around 2000-2500 calories for adults. But maybe for some people, especially if they are active or have higher energy needs, 2000 could be on the higher side. But the question is just asking for the calculation, not whether it's realistic. So, maybe mathematically, 2% equals 40 calories leads to 2000 total calories. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let's use the formula: part = percentage × whole. Here, the part is 40 calories, the percentage is 2%, so 40 = 0.02 × total calories. To find the total, we can rearrange the formula: total calories = 40 / 0.02. Let's calculate that. 40 divided by 0.02. Hmm, 0.02 goes into 40 how many times? Since 0.02 is 2 hundredths, so 40 divided by 2 hundredths is 40 × 50, because dividing by 0.02 is multiplying by 50. 40 times 50 is 2000. So that confirms the same result. 

So, both methods give 2000 calories. Even though it seems high, mathematically that's the answer. I don't think there's a mistake here. Maybe the question is testing understanding of percentages. So, the answer should be 2000 calories.
