Okay, let's see. I need to find the value of the square symbol using the given equations. The symbols triangle, square, diamond, and clubsuit are four different integers from 1 to 9. Let me write down the equations again to make sure I have them right:

1. Triangle + Square = Clubsuit
2. Triangle + Triangle = Diamond + Diamond + Diamond + Diamond + Diamond
3. Triangle + Triangle = Clubsuit + Diamond

Hmm, so the second equation is Triangle multiplied by 2 equals Diamond multiplied by 5. That's an important relationship. Let me write that as 2 * Triangle = 5 * Diamond. Since all symbols are integers, this means that 2T = 5D. So, T must be a multiple of 5, and D must be a multiple of 2. But the numbers are from 1 to 9, so let's see possible values.

Multiples of 5 in 1-9 are 5. So, T could be 5, making D = (2*5)/5 = 2. Wait, but let me check that. If T is 5, then 2*5 = 10, which would mean 5D = 10, so D = 2. But D has to be an integer from 1-9. So yes, T=5 and D=2. Let me verify if that's the only possibility. Since 5 is the only multiple of 5 in 1-9, that's the only possible pair here.

So, Triangle is 5 and Diamond is 2. Let me note that down:

Triangle = 5

Diamond = 2

Now, moving to the third equation: Triangle + Triangle = Clubsuit + Diamond. Plugging in the known values:

5 + 5 = Clubsuit + 2

10 = Clubsuit + 2

So Clubsuit = 10 - 2 = 8. Therefore, Clubsuit is 8. Let me check if that's allowed. Clubsuit is 8, which is within 1-9, and it's different from Triangle (5) and Diamond (2). So far, so good.

Now, the first equation is Triangle + Square = Clubsuit. Plugging in the known values:

5 + Square = 8

Therefore, Square = 8 - 5 = 3. So Square is 3. Let me check if all symbols are unique. We have Triangle=5, Square=3, Diamond=2, Clubsuit=8. Yes, all are different and within 1-9. That seems to fit all the equations.

Wait, let me double-check all equations with these values:

First equation: 5 + 3 = 8. Correct.

Second equation: 5 + 5 = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2. 10 = 10. Correct.

Third equation: 5 + 5 = 8 + 2. 10 = 10. Correct.

Everything checks out. So the value of Square is 3.

But wait, let me make sure there are no other possible values for Triangle and Diamond. For example, if Triangle was a different multiple of 5, but since we only have numbers up to 9, the only multiple of 5 is 5. So T must be 5. Then D must be 2. So this is the only possible solution. Therefore, Square is definitely 3.

I think that's the answer. Let me just recap:

- From the second equation, 2T = 5D. Only possible with T=5 and D=2.
- From the third equation, 2T = Clubsuit + D => 10 = Clubsuit + 2 => Clubsuit=8.
- From the first equation, T + Square = Clubsuit => 5 + Square = 8 => Square=3.

All constraints are satisfied, and all symbols are unique. So yes, the answer is 3.
Therefore, the value of $\square$ is $\boxed{3}$.
