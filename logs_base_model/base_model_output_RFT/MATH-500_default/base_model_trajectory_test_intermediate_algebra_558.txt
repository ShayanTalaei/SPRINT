Okay, let's see. I need to find the values of λ between 0 and 4 such that there exists an x in [0,1] where f(x) ≠ x but f(f(x)) = x. The function f is given by f(x) = λx(1 - x). Hmm. So, first, maybe I should start by understanding what the problem is asking. It's about fixed points and periodic points of period 2. A fixed point is where f(x) = x, but here we need points where applying f twice brings us back to x, but f(x) itself isn't equal to x. So these are points of period 2. 

I remember that in dynamical systems, a period-2 point is a point that isn't a fixed point but satisfies f(f(x)) = x. So, to find such points, we need to solve the equation f(f(x)) = x, but exclude the solutions where f(x) = x. Therefore, the strategy is to first find all solutions to f(f(x)) = x, and then subtract the solutions where f(x) = x. The remaining solutions will be the period-2 points we're interested in. 

So, first, let me compute f(f(x)). Let's do that step by step. 

Given f(x) = λx(1 - x), then f(f(x)) would be f(λx(1 - x)). Let's substitute that into f:

f(λx(1 - x)) = λ * [λx(1 - x)] * [1 - λx(1 - x)]

Simplify that:

= λ * λx(1 - x) * [1 - λx(1 - x)]

= λ²x(1 - x) * [1 - λx + λx²]

So, expanding this, but maybe instead of expanding immediately, let's set f(f(x)) = x and solve for x.

So, the equation is:

λ²x(1 - x)[1 - λx(1 - x)] = x

Let me denote this as:

λ²x(1 - x)[1 - λx(1 - x)] - x = 0

Factor out x:

x [λ²(1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)) - 1] = 0

So, this gives two possibilities:

1. x = 0
2. The other factor is zero: λ²(1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)) - 1 = 0

Now, x = 0 is a solution. Let's check if it's a fixed point. f(0) = λ*0*(1 - 0) = 0, so yes, x=0 is a fixed point. Similarly, x=1: f(1) = λ*1*(1 - 1) = 0, so f(1)=0. Then f(f(1)) = f(0) = 0 ≠ 1, so x=1 is not a fixed point. But in our equation above, x=0 is a solution. However, since we need x such that f(x) ≠ x, we have to exclude x=0. Similarly, x=1 is not a fixed point, but let's check if it's a solution to f(f(x))=x. 

f(f(1)) = f(0) = 0 ≠ 1, so x=1 is not a solution. So, the other solutions come from the equation:

λ²(1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)) - 1 = 0

Let me denote this equation as:

λ²(1 - x)(1 - λx + λx²) - 1 = 0

Let me expand the terms step by step. First, expand (1 - x)(1 - λx + λx²):

Multiply 1 by each term: 1*(1 - λx + λx²) = 1 - λx + λx²

Multiply -x by each term: -x*(1 - λx + λx²) = -x + λx² - λx³

Combine these:

1 - λx + λx² - x + λx² - λx³

Combine like terms:

1 - (λx + x) + (λx² + λx²) - λx³

= 1 - x(λ + 1) + 2λx² - λx³

So, the equation becomes:

λ² [1 - (λ + 1)x + 2λx² - λx³] - 1 = 0

Multiply through by λ²:

λ² - λ²(λ + 1)x + 2λ³x² - λ³x³ - 1 = 0

Simplify each term:

First term: λ²

Second term: -λ²(λ + 1)x = -λ³x - λ²x

Third term: +2λ³x²

Fourth term: -λ³x³

Fifth term: -1

Combine all terms:

λ² - 1 - λ³x - λ²x + 2λ³x² - λ³x³ = 0

Now, let's collect like terms:

Constant term: λ² - 1

x term: -λ³x - λ²x = -x(λ³ + λ²)

x² term: +2λ³x²

x³ term: -λ³x³

So, the equation is:

-λ³x³ + 2λ³x² - (λ³ + λ²)x + (λ² - 1) = 0

Multiply both sides by -1 to make the leading coefficient positive:

λ³x³ - 2λ³x² + (λ³ + λ²)x + (1 - λ²) = 0

So, we have a cubic equation in x:

λ³x³ - 2λ³x² + (λ³ + λ²)x + (1 - λ²) = 0

We need to solve this cubic equation for x in [0,1], but remember that we need to exclude solutions where f(x) = x. So, first, let's find all roots of this equation, and then check which ones satisfy f(x) ≠ x.

But solving a cubic equation might be complex. However, note that we already factored out x=0 earlier, but in the equation above, x=0 is not a root. Wait, let's check. If we plug x=0 into the cubic equation:

0 - 0 + 0 + (1 - λ²) = 1 - λ². So, unless λ² = 1, x=0 is not a root here. However, x=0 was a solution to the original equation f(f(x))=x, but we need to exclude it because f(0)=0, which is a fixed point. So, in the cubic equation, x=0 is not a root, which suggests that all the solutions to the cubic equation are the non-fixed points. Therefore, solving this cubic equation will give us the period-2 points.

But maybe there's a better way. Let's recall that the fixed points of f are solutions to f(x) = x, which is λx(1 - x) = x. Let's solve that equation first.

Set λx(1 - x) = x. Then, bring all terms to one side:

λx(1 - x) - x = 0

Factor out x:

x[λ(1 - x) - 1] = 0

So, solutions are x=0 and λ(1 - x) - 1 = 0. Let's solve the latter:

λ(1 - x) - 1 = 0

λ(1 - x) = 1

1 - x = 1/λ

x = 1 - 1/λ

But this is valid only if λ ≠ 0. If λ = 0, then the equation becomes 0 - x = 0 => x=0, so only fixed point is x=0.

So, for λ ≠ 0, the fixed points are x=0 and x=1 - 1/λ. But we need x to be in [0,1], so 1 - 1/λ must be in [0,1]. Let's find the range of λ where this is true.

1 - 1/λ ≥ 0 implies 1/λ ≤ 1 => λ ≥ 1.

And 1 - 1/λ ≤ 1 is always true since 1/λ ≥ 0 for λ > 0. So, for λ ≥ 1, x=1 - 1/λ is a fixed point in [0,1].

So, fixed points are:

- x=0 for all λ in [0,4]
- x=1 - 1/λ for λ in [1,4]

Therefore, to find the period-2 points, we need to solve f(f(x))=x but exclude x=0 and x=1 - 1/λ (if any). However, x=1 - 1/λ is a fixed point, so we need to exclude it as well.

But perhaps, since the cubic equation we derived earlier already excludes x=0, as we saw, and the roots of the cubic equation are the period-2 points. Therefore, the solutions to the cubic equation are the period-2 points, and we need to ensure that these solutions are not fixed points.

But let's check if any roots of the cubic equation coincide with the fixed points. For example, if x=1 - 1/λ is a root of the cubic equation, then we need to exclude it. Let's substitute x = 1 - 1/λ into the cubic equation and see if it satisfies it.

Substitute x = 1 - 1/λ into the cubic equation:

λ³x³ - 2λ³x² + (λ³ + λ²)x + (1 - λ²) = 0

Compute each term:

First term: λ³(1 - 1/λ)^3

Second term: -2λ³(1 - 1/λ)^2

Third term: (λ³ + λ²)(1 - 1/λ)

Fourth term: 1 - λ²

Let's compute each term step by step.

First term:

λ³(1 - 1/λ)^3 = λ³[(1)^3 - 3(1)^2(1/λ) + 3(1)(1/λ)^2 - (1/λ)^3] = λ³[1 - 3/λ + 3/λ² - 1/λ³] = λ³ - 3λ² + 3λ - 1

Second term:

-2λ³(1 - 1/λ)^2 = -2λ³[1 - 2/λ + 1/λ²] = -2λ³ + 4λ² - 2λ

Third term:

(λ³ + λ²)(1 - 1/λ) = (λ³ + λ²)(1) - (λ³ + λ²)(1/λ) = λ³ + λ² - λ² - λ = λ³ - λ

Fourth term:

1 - λ²

Now, add all terms together:

First term: λ³ - 3λ² + 3λ - 1

Second term: -2λ³ + 4λ² - 2λ

Third term: λ³ - λ

Fourth term: 1 - λ²

Combine all:

(λ³ - 2λ³ + λ³) + (-3λ² + 4λ² - λ²) + (3λ - 2λ - λ) + (-1 + 1)

Simplify each group:

λ³ terms: (1 - 2 + 1)λ³ = 0

λ² terms: (-3 + 4 - 1)λ² = 0

λ terms: (3 - 2 - 1)λ = 0

Constants: (-1 + 1) = 0

So, all terms sum to 0. Therefore, x = 1 - 1/λ is indeed a root of the cubic equation. Therefore, when solving the cubic equation, x=1 - 1/λ is a solution. However, since we need f(x) ≠ x, we must exclude this solution. Therefore, the other roots of the cubic equation are the period-2 points. 

Therefore, the cubic equation factors as (x - (1 - 1/λ)) * (quadratic) = 0. Let's perform polynomial division to factor out (x - (1 - 1/λ)) from the cubic equation.

Alternatively, since we know that x=1 - 1/λ is a root, we can factor the cubic equation as (x - (1 - 1/λ))(ax² + bx + c) = 0. Let's find a, b, c.

Expanding the product:

x(ax² + bx + c) - (1 - 1/λ)(ax² + bx + c) = ax³ + bx² + cx - a(1 - 1/λ)x² - b(1 - 1/λ)x - c(1 - 1/λ)

Combine like terms:

ax³ + [b - a(1 - 1/λ)]x² + [c - b(1 - 1/λ)]x - c(1 - 1/λ)

Set this equal to the original cubic equation:

λ³x³ - 2λ³x² + (λ³ + λ²)x + (1 - λ²)

Therefore, equate coefficients:

a x³: a = λ³

x² term: b - a(1 - 1/λ) = -2λ³

x term: c - b(1 - 1/λ) = λ³ + λ²

constant term: -c(1 - 1/λ) = 1 - λ²

So, solving step by step:

From a = λ³.

From x² term: b - λ³(1 - 1/λ) = -2λ³

Compute λ³(1 - 1/λ) = λ³ - λ²

Therefore, b - (λ³ - λ²) = -2λ³ => b = -2λ³ + λ³ - λ² = -λ³ - λ²

From x term: c - (-λ³ - λ²)(1 - 1/λ) = λ³ + λ²

First compute (-λ³ - λ²)(1 - 1/λ):

= -λ³(1 - 1/λ) - λ²(1 - 1/λ)

= -λ³ + λ² - λ² + λ

= -λ³ + λ

Therefore, c - (-λ³ + λ) = λ³ + λ² => c + λ³ - λ = λ³ + λ² => c = λ² + λ

From constant term: -c(1 - 1/λ) = 1 - λ²

We have c = λ² + λ, so:

-(λ² + λ)(1 - 1/λ) = 1 - λ²

Compute (λ² + λ)(1 - 1/λ):

= λ²(1 - 1/λ) + λ(1 - 1/λ)

= λ² - λ + λ - 1

= λ² - 1

Therefore, - (λ² - 1) = -λ² + 1 = 1 - λ², which matches the constant term. Therefore, the factorization is correct.

Therefore, the cubic equation factors as:

(x - (1 - 1/λ))(λ³x² + (-λ³ - λ²)x + (λ² + λ)) = 0

Therefore, the quadratic factor is:

λ³x² + (-λ³ - λ²)x + (λ² + λ) = 0

Let me write this quadratic equation as:

λ³x² - (λ³ + λ²)x + (λ² + λ) = 0

Factor out λ from each term:

λ[λ²x² - (λ² + λ)x + (λ + 1)] = 0

Since λ ∈ [0,4], and we're considering λ ≠ 0 (since we factored out x=0 earlier), we can divide both sides by λ:

λ²x² - (λ² + λ)x + (λ + 1) = 0

So, the quadratic equation is:

λ²x² - (λ² + λ)x + (λ + 1) = 0

Let me write this as:

λ²x² - λ(λ + 1)x + (λ + 1) = 0

Perhaps factor this quadratic equation. Let's see.

Let me try to factor it:

Looking for factors of the form (ax + b)(cx + d) = 0, where a, b, c, d are expressions in λ.

The product should be λ²x² - λ(λ + 1)x + (λ + 1). Let's see.

Alternatively, use quadratic formula.

Quadratic equation: ax² + bx + c = 0, solutions x = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)]/(2a)

Here, a = λ², b = -λ(λ + 1), c = λ + 1

Compute discriminant D:

D = b² - 4ac = [ -λ(λ + 1) ]² - 4 * λ² * (λ + 1)

= λ²(λ + 1)² - 4λ²(λ + 1)

Factor out λ²(λ + 1):

= λ²(λ + 1)[(λ + 1) - 4]

= λ²(λ + 1)(λ + 1 - 4)

= λ²(λ + 1)(λ - 3)

Therefore, the solutions are:

x = [λ(λ + 1) ± sqrt(λ²(λ + 1)(λ - 3))]/(2λ²)

Simplify sqrt term:

sqrt(λ²(λ + 1)(λ - 3)) = λ sqrt{(λ + 1)(λ - 3)}

Note that for the square root to be real, the argument must be non-negative:

(λ + 1)(λ - 3) ≥ 0

This inequality holds when λ ≤ -1 or λ ≥ 3. However, since λ ∈ [0,4], the valid interval is λ ≥ 3.

Therefore, for λ ∈ [3,4], the discriminant is non-negative, and we have real solutions. For λ ∈ [0,3), the discriminant is negative, so the quadratic equation has no real roots. Therefore, in those cases, the only real solutions to the original cubic equation are x=1 - 1/λ (which is a fixed point and is excluded) and x=0 (which is also excluded). Therefore, for λ ∈ [0,3), there are no period-2 points. For λ ∈ [3,4], we have real solutions from the quadratic equation, which are the period-2 points. 

Therefore, the values of λ for which there exists x ∈ [0,1] such that f(x) ≠ x but f(f(x)) = x are the λ ∈ [3,4].

Wait, but let's verify this conclusion. Let's check for example λ=3.

At λ=3, the fixed points are x=0 and x=1 - 1/3 = 2/3. So, x=2/3 is a fixed point. The quadratic equation becomes:

3²x² - (3² + 3)x + (3 + 1) = 9x² - 12x + 4 = 0

Solutions:

x = [12 ± sqrt(144 - 144)]/(18) = [12 ± 0]/18 = 12/18 = 2/3. So, repeated root at x=2/3. But that's a fixed point. Wait, but we already factored out x=1 - 1/λ, which is 2/3 in this case. So, perhaps there's a mistake here. Let me check.

Wait, when λ=3, the quadratic equation is 9x² - 12x + 4 = 0, which is (3x - 2)^2 = 0, so double root at x=2/3. But that's the fixed point. So, in this case, the quadratic equation doesn't give any additional solutions. Therefore, even though the discriminant is zero at λ=3, the only root is the fixed point. Therefore, perhaps the period-2 points start appearing when the quadratic has distinct roots different from the fixed points.

Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation. Let's check. For λ=3, the quadratic equation is 9x² - 12x + 4 = 0. The discriminant is (-12)^2 - 4*9*4 = 144 - 144 = 0. So, only one real root, which is x=12/(2*9)=12/18=2/3. But that's the fixed point. Therefore, for λ=3, the quadratic equation does not give any new solutions. Therefore, perhaps the conclusion is that period-2 points exist only when the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots different from the fixed points. Let's check for λ=4.

At λ=4, the quadratic equation becomes:

16x² - (16 + 4)x + (4 + 1) = 16x² - 20x + 5 = 0

Discriminant D = (-20)^2 - 4*16*5 = 400 - 320 = 80 > 0. Therefore, two distinct real roots:

x = [20 ± sqrt(80)]/(32) = [20 ± 4*sqrt(5)]/32 = [5 ± sqrt(5)]/8 ≈ [5 ± 2.236]/8

So, approximately:

x ≈ (5 + 2.236)/8 ≈ 7.236/8 ≈ 0.9045

x ≈ (5 - 2.236)/8 ≈ 2.764/8 ≈ 0.3455

Now, check if these x values are in [0,1]. Both are, and neither is equal to 1 - 1/4 = 3/4. Therefore, these are valid period-2 points. 

Therefore, for λ=4, there are two period-2 points. Therefore, the conclusion is that for λ ∈ (3,4], there exist period-2 points. At λ=3, the quadratic equation gives a repeated root at x=2/3, which is the fixed point, so no period-2 points. Therefore, the values of λ are (3,4]. Wait, but the original problem says "values of λ, 0 ≤ λ ≤ 4, for which there exists an x ∈ [0,1] such that f(x) ≠ x but f(f(x)) = x." So, does λ=3 satisfy this? Let's check.

At λ=3, the fixed points are x=0 and x=2/3. The quadratic equation gives x=2/3 (double root). Therefore, all solutions to f(f(x))=x are fixed points. Therefore, there are no x where f(x)≠x but f(f(x))=x. Therefore, λ=3 is excluded. Hence, the correct interval is (3,4]. But the problem asks for λ ∈ [0,4]. So, the answer is 3 < λ ≤4.

But let me confirm with another value, say λ=3.5. Then the quadratic equation is:

(3.5)^2 x² - (3.5)^2 -3.5)x + (3.5 +1)=0

Compute 3.5^2 = 12.25, 3.5^2 +3.5 = 12.25 +3.5=15.75, 3.5 +1=4.5

Therefore, equation is 12.25x² -15.75x +4.5=0

Multiply all terms by 16 to eliminate decimals:

12.25*16=196, 15.75*16=252, 4.5*16=72

So, 196x² -252x +72=0

Divide by 4: 49x² -63x +18=0

Discriminant D=63² -4*49*18=3969 -3528=441=21²

Solutions: x=(63 ±21)/98= (84)/98=6/7≈0.857 and (42)/98=3/7≈0.428. Both are in [0,1], and neither is 1 -1/3.5≈0.714. Therefore, these are valid period-2 points. Therefore, for λ=3.5, there are period-2 points. 

Therefore, the interval is indeed (3,4]. Therefore, the final answer is all λ in (3,4].

But the problem says "values of λ, 0 ≤ λ ≤ 4". So, the answer is 3 < λ ≤4. Wait, but in our earlier analysis, at λ=4, there are two period-2 points. At λ approaching 3 from above, the period-2 points approach x=2/3. But at λ=3, the period-2 points collapse to the fixed point. Therefore, the values are (3,4].

But let me check the original question again. It says, "there exists an x ∈ [0,1] such that f(x) ≠ x but f(f(x)) = x." So, even if there's only one such x, it's sufficient. So, if for λ=3, there's only the fixed point, so no such x exists. Therefore, λ must be greater than 3. Hence, the answer is λ ∈ (3,4].

But let me check another value, say λ=3. Let me compute f(f(x)) when x is not 2/3. Let's pick x=1/2. Then f(1/2)=3*(1/2)*(1 -1/2)=3*(1/2)*(1/2)=3/4. Then f(f(1/2))=f(3/4)=3*(3/4)*(1 -3/4)=3*(3/4)*(1/4)=9/16 ≈0.5625 ≠ x=1/2. So, f(f(1/2))≠1/2, so x=1/2 is not a period-2 point. Similarly, x=0. Let's check x=1. f(1)=0, f(f(1))=f(0)=0≠1. So, x=1 is not a period-2 point. x=1/4. f(1/4)=3*(1/4)*(3/4)=9/16≈0.5625. f(f(1/4))=f(9/16)=3*(9/16)*(7/16)=189/256≈0.738 ≠1/4. So, no. So, seems like at λ=3, all points either go to fixed points or diverge. Therefore, there are no period-2 points at λ=3. Therefore, the answer is (3,4].

But the problem statement says "values of λ, 0 ≤ λ ≤4". So, perhaps the answer is λ ∈ (3,4].

But let me check λ=3. Let's solve the cubic equation for λ=3. The cubic equation is:

3³x³ -2*3³x² + (3³ +3²)x + (1 -3²)=0

Compute:

27x³ -54x² + (27 +9)x + (1 -9)=0

Simplify:

27x³ -54x² +36x -8=0

Divide by GCD 1:

27x³ -54x² +36x -8=0

Try rational roots. Possible roots are factors of 8 over factors of 27: ±1, ±2, ±4, ±8, ±1/3, etc. Let's test x=2/3:

27*(8/27) -54*(4/9) +36*(2/3) -8=8 -24 +24 -8=0. Yes, x=2/3 is a root. Factor (x - 2/3):

Use polynomial division. Divide 27x³ -54x² +36x -8 by (x - 2/3).

Alternatively, write as (x - 2/3)(ax² + bx + c)=0

Multiply out:

x(ax² + bx + c) -2/3(ax² + bx + c)=ax³ +bx² +cx -2/3ax² -2/3bx -2/3c

Combine like terms:

ax³ + (b - 2a/3)x² + (c - 2b/3)x -2c/3

Set equal to original:

ax³ + (b - 2a/3)x² + (c - 2b/3)x -2c/3 =27x³ -54x² +36x -8

Therefore:

a=27

b - 2a/3 = -54 => b - 18 = -54 => b= -36

c - 2b/3 = 36 => c - (-24)=36 => c=12

-2c/3 = -8 => -24/3= -8 => -8=-8. Correct.

Therefore, the cubic factors as (x - 2/3)(27x² -36x +12)=0

Factor out 3 from quadratic:

27x² -36x +12 = 3(9x² -12x +4)=3(3x -2)^2

Therefore, the cubic equation factors as:

(x - 2/3)*3*(3x -2)^2=0

Therefore, roots are x=2/3 (double root) and x=2/3. So, all roots are x=2/3. Therefore, at λ=3, all solutions to f(f(x))=x are fixed points. Therefore, there are no period-2 points. Therefore, λ=3 is excluded. Therefore, the interval is (3,4].

Therefore, the final answer is all real numbers λ such that 3 < λ ≤4. Therefore, λ ∈ (3,4].

But the problem asks for values of λ in [0,4]. So, we should write the answer as (3,4].

But let me check another edge case. Let's take λ approaching 4 from below. For example, λ=4-ε, where ε is small. Then, the quadratic equation would have two distinct roots, both different from the fixed points. Therefore, these roots are valid period-2 points. At λ=4, as we saw, two distinct roots. Therefore, the interval is indeed (3,4]. 

Therefore, the answer is all real numbers λ with 3 < λ ≤4. 

But let me check once more. Suppose λ=4. The quadratic equation is 16x² -20x +5=0. The solutions are [20 ± sqrt(400 - 320)]/32 = [20 ± sqrt(80)]/32 = [20 ± 4√5]/32 = [5 ± √5]/8. These are approximately 0.9045 and 0.3455. These are both in [0,1], and neither is equal to 1 - 1/4=0.75. Therefore, they are valid period-2 points. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that for λ ∈ (3,4], there exists x ∈ [0,1] such that f(x) ≠x but f(f(x))=x. 

Thus, the final answer is the interval (3,4]. 

But the problem statement says "Find the values of λ, 0 ≤ λ ≤4, for which there exists an x ∈ [0,1] such that f(x) ≠ x but f(f(x)) = x." So, the answer is all λ in (3,4]. 

But the problem asks for the values, so in boxed notation, we can write it as \boxed{(3,4]}.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the user specified to put the final answer within \boxed{}, and in the initial instructions, it's written "Find the values of λ...". So, if they expect an interval, we can present it as (3,4]. But in the system's instruction, the user wrote "put your final answer within \boxed{}", so perhaps we need to use interval notation. Alternatively, if they expect a specific number, but since it's an interval, we can present it as above.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is λ ∈ (3,4], so in boxed notation, \boxed{(3, 4]}.
