Okay, so I need to solve the equation 2^8 = 4^x and find the value of x. Hmm, let's see. Both sides of the equation are powers of numbers, but they're different bases. The left side is 2 raised to the 8th power, and the right side is 4 raised to the xth power. Maybe I can express both sides with the same base to make it easier to compare the exponents.

Wait, 4 is actually 2 squared, right? So 4 is equal to 2^2. That means 4^x can be rewritten as (2^2)^x. When you raise a power to another power, you multiply the exponents. So (2^2)^x becomes 2^(2x). So now the equation is 2^8 = 2^(2x).

Since the bases are the same and both sides of the equation are equal, the exponents must be equal too. So 8 must equal 2x. Solving for x, I divide both sides by 2. That gives x = 8/2, which is 4. So x is 4. Let me check that to make sure.

If I plug x = 4 back into the original equation: 4^4. Let's compute both sides. The left side is 2^8. 2^8 is 256. The right side is 4^4, which is 4*4*4*4. That's 16*16, which is 256. Yep, both sides are equal. So x = 4 is the correct answer. That seems straightforward. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem?

Alternatively, I could take logarithms of both sides. Let's try that method to verify. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: ln(2^8) = ln(4^x). Using the logarithm power rule, which states that ln(a^b) = b*ln(a), so this becomes 8*ln(2) = x*ln(4). Then solving for x, we get x = (8*ln(2))/ln(4). Now, since 4 is 2^2, ln(4) is ln(2^2) = 2*ln(2). So substituting that in, x = (8*ln(2))/(2*ln(2)) = 8/2 = 4. Same result. So that confirms it again.

Another way: maybe convert both sides to base 4. The left side is 2^8. Since 2 is the square root of 4, 2 is 4^(1/2). So 2^8 is (4^(1/2))^8 = 4^(8*(1/2)) = 4^4. So again, 4^4 = 4^x implies x=4. All methods lead to the same answer. I think that's solid. There's no ambiguity here. The answer is 4. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. The key was recognizing that 4 is 2 squared, which allows us to express both sides with the same base. Then equating the exponents gives the solution. The alternative methods using logarithms also confirm the result. So x must be 4.
Therefore, the value of \( x \) is \(\boxed{4}\).
