Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how many daps equal 42 baps, given the conversion rates between daps, yaps, and baps. Hmm. Let's start by breaking down the information provided.

First, the problem states that 4 daps equal 7 yaps. So, if I write that as an equation, it would be 4 daps = 7 yaps. Similarly, it says 5 yaps equal 3 baps, so that's 5 yaps = 3 baps. My goal is to convert 42 baps into daps. 

I think the way to approach this is to use conversion factors. Since we have relationships between daps and yaps, and between yaps and baps, we can chain these together to convert from baps to daps. Let me recall how unit conversions work. If I have a certain number of baps, I can convert them to yaps first using the given ratio, and then convert those yaps to daps using another ratio. That makes sense.

Let me write down the steps:

1. Start with 42 baps.
2. Convert baps to yaps using the given ratio (5 yaps = 3 baps).
3. Convert the resulting yaps to daps using the other ratio (4 daps = 7 yaps).

So, first step: converting 42 baps to yaps. The ratio is 5 yaps per 3 baps. To find out how many yaps are in 42 baps, I can set up a proportion. 

If 3 baps = 5 yaps, then 1 bap = 5/3 yaps. Therefore, 42 baps would be 42 * (5/3) yaps. Let me compute that. 42 divided by 3 is 14, and 14 times 5 is 70. So 42 baps equal 70 yaps. 

Wait, let me check that again. 3 baps = 5 yaps, so 1 bap = 5/3 yaps. Therefore, 42 baps * (5/3) yaps per bap. 42 * 5 = 210, divided by 3 is 70. Yes, that's correct. So 70 yaps.

Next, convert 70 yaps to daps. The given ratio is 4 daps = 7 yaps. So 1 yap = 4/7 daps. Therefore, 70 yaps * (4/7) daps per yap. Let's compute that. 70 divided by 7 is 10, and 10 times 4 is 40. So 70 yaps equal 40 daps.

Therefore, 42 baps equal 40 daps. Let me verify the calculations once more to be sure.

First conversion: 42 baps * (5 yaps / 3 baps) = (42 * 5) / 3 = 210 / 3 = 70 yaps. Correct.

Second conversion: 70 yaps * (4 daps / 7 yaps) = (70 * 4) / 7 = 280 / 7 = 40 daps. Correct.

So the final answer should be 40 daps. That seems straightforward. Let me think if there's another way to approach this, maybe by finding a common unit or using dimensional analysis. 

Alternatively, I could express all the units in terms of one base unit. Let's say we find the number of daps in one bap, then multiply by 42. Let's try that method to cross-validate.

Starting with 4 daps = 7 yaps. So daps per yap is 4/7. Then, 5 yaps = 3 baps, so yaps per bap is 5/3. Therefore, daps per bap would be (4/7) daps per yap * (5/3) yaps per bap = (4*5)/(7*3) daps per bap = 20/21 daps per bap. 

Therefore, 1 bap = 20/21 daps. Then, 42 baps would be 42 * (20/21) daps. Let's compute that. 42 divided by 21 is 2, so 2 * 20 = 40. Same result. So that confirms it again. 

Another way: using ratios. If 4 daps = 7 yaps, then the ratio of daps to yaps is 4:7. Similarly, 5 yaps = 3 baps, so yaps to baps ratio is 5:3. To combine these, we need a common term, which is yaps. So we can express daps in terms of baps by combining these two ratios.

The first ratio is daps/yaps = 4/7. The second ratio is yaps/baps = 5/3. To combine them, multiply the two ratios: (4/7) * (5/3) = 20/21. So daps/baps = 20/21. Therefore, daps = (20/21) * baps. Hence, 42 baps * 20/21 = 40 daps. Same answer again. 

All three methods lead to the same result, so I'm confident that 42 baps equal 40 daps.
Therefore, the number of daps equal to 42 baps is $\boxed{40}$.
