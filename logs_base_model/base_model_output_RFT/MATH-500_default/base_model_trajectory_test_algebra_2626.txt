Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how much $24,000 will grow in five years with a government bond that pays 1% interest every two months. Hmm, so it's compounding interest, right? Because each time the interest is added, it affects the principal for the next period. 

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. The investment is $24,000, and it's compounded bi-monthly at 1% each period. The question is asking for the total amount after five years. The answer needs to be a whole number, rounded as specified.

Alright, so the key here is to use the compound interest formula. The formula for compound interest is:

A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)

Where:
- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- P is the principal amount ($24,000).
- r is the annual interest rate (decimal form).
- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.
- t is the time the money is invested for in years.

But wait, in this problem, the interest is compounded bi-monthly, which is every two months. So I need to adjust the formula accordingly.

First, let's figure out the values. The interest rate per period is 1% every two months. So each compounding period is two months, and the rate per period is 0.01. 

Now, how many compounding periods are there in five years? Let's calculate that. 

There are 12 months in a year, so in five years, there are 5*12 = 60 months. Since each period is two months, the number of periods is 60 / 2 = 30. So n (the number of periods) is 30. 

But wait, in the standard formula, n is the number of times compounded per year. But here, each period is two months, so the number of periods per year is 12 / 2 = 6. So n = 6. But the time t is 5 years. So the total number of periods is 6 * 5 = 30. 

So using the formula, A = P(1 + r)^n, where r is the rate per period and n is the number of periods. 

Wait, but in the standard formula, n is the number of times compounded per year. But here, each compounding is a two-month period, so the rate per compounding period is 1%, and the number of periods in 5 years is 30. 

Alternatively, maybe I can think of the annual rate. Since each two-month period is 1%, then in a year, which has 6 two-month periods, the annual rate would be 6*1% = 6%. But wait, that might not be accurate because compounding is involved. Let me check.

If each two-month period adds 1%, then over a year (which is 6 periods), the amount would be multiplied by (1 + 0.01)^6. So the annual effective rate would be (1.01)^6 - 1. But the question is asking for five years, so if we use the annual rate, we can compute (1 + annual rate)^5. But perhaps it's easier to just use the number of periods.

Wait, maybe it's better to stick with the original formula. Let's see.

The principal is $24,000. The interest rate per compounding period is 1% or 0.01. The number of periods is 30. So the formula becomes:

A = 24000 * (1 + 0.01)^30

Yes, that seems right. Because each two months, the amount increases by 1%, and there are 30 such periods in five years. 

Alternatively, if I were to convert the rate to an annual rate, but since the compounding is bi-monthly, using the per-period rate and the total number of periods is more straightforward.

So let's compute (1.01)^30. I can use logarithms or a calculator for that. But since I don't have a calculator here, perhaps I can approximate it.

Wait, but maybe I should just compute it step by step. Let's see.

Alternatively, using the formula for compound interest with multiple periods. Let me recall that (1 + r)^n, where r is the rate per period, and n is the number of periods.

So here, r = 0.01, n = 30. So (1.01)^30. 

I remember that (1.01)^10 is approximately 1.104622. Then (1.01)^20 would be (1.104622)^2 ≈ 1.220190. Then (1.01)^30 would be (1.220190)*(1.104622) ≈ 1.220190*1.104622. Let me compute that.

1.220190 * 1.104622. Let's do this multiplication:

1.220190 * 1.104622 ≈ 1.220190 * 1.104622. Let's break it down:

First, 1 * 1.104622 = 1.104622

0.220190 * 1.104622 ≈ 0.220190 * 1 = 0.220190; 0.220190 * 0.104622 ≈ 0.220190*0.1 = 0.022019; 0.220190*0.004622 ≈ ~0.001018. So total ≈ 0.220190 + 0.022019 + 0.001018 ≈ 0.243227

So total ≈ 1.104622 + 0.243227 ≈ 1.347849

So (1.01)^30 ≈ 1.347849. Then the amount A is 24000 * 1.347849 ≈ ?

Calculating 24000 * 1.347849. Let's break it down:

24000 * 1 = 24000

24000 * 0.347849 ≈ 24000 * 0.3 = 7200; 24000 * 0.047849 ≈ 24000 * 0.04 = 960; 24000 * 0.007849 ≈ ~24000*0.007 = 168; 24000*0.000849 ≈ ~20.376

Adding those up: 7200 + 960 = 8160; 8160 + 168 = 8328; 8328 + 20.376 ≈ 8348.376

So total amount ≈ 24000 + 8348.376 ≈ 32348.376

So approximately $32,348.38. But wait, this is an approximation. Let me check if (1.01)^30 is actually 1.347849 or if my estimation is off.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use logarithms for a more accurate calculation.

Take natural log of (1.01)^30 = 30 * ln(1.01). 

ln(1.01) ≈ 0.00995033. So 30 * 0.00995033 ≈ 0.29851. Then exponentiate that: e^0.29851 ≈ e^0.3 ≈ 1.349858. But 0.29851 is slightly less than 0.3, so maybe around 1.347. 

So (1.01)^30 ≈ 1.3478, which is close to our initial approximation. So 1.3478 * 24000.

24000 * 1.3478. Let's compute 24000 * 1.3 = 31200; 24000 * 0.0478 = 24000 * 0.04 = 960; 24000 * 0.0078 = 187.2. So 960 + 187.2 = 1147.2. Then total is 31200 + 1147.2 = 32347.2. So approximately $32,347.20. 

But this is still an approximation. To get a more accurate value, perhaps I need to compute (1.01)^30 more accurately.

Alternatively, use the formula for compound interest step by step.

Let me try to compute (1.01)^30 step by step. Let's see:

(1.01)^1 = 1.01

(1.01)^2 = 1.01 * 1.01 = 1.0201

(1.01)^4 = (1.0201)^2 ≈ 1.04060401

(1.01)^8 = (1.04060401)^2 ≈ 1.08285671

(1.01)^16 = (1.08285671)^2 ≈ 1.17201912

(1.01)^32 = (1.17201912)^2 ≈ 1.37168013

But we need (1.01)^30, which is (1.01)^32 / (1.01)^2 ≈ 1.37168013 / 1.0201 ≈ 1.3446

Wait, that's different from the previous estimates. Hmm. So if (1.01)^32 is approximately 1.37168, then dividing by (1.01)^2 gives (1.01)^30 ≈ 1.37168 / 1.0201 ≈ 1.3446

So 1.3446 * 24000 = ?

Calculating 24000 * 1.3446. Let's break it down:

24000 * 1 = 24000

24000 * 0.3 = 7200

24000 * 0.04 = 960

24000 * 0.0046 = 110.4

Adding those up: 7200 + 960 = 8160; 8160 + 110.4 = 8270.4

Total amount: 24000 + 8270.4 = 32270.4

Wait, that's $32,270.40. But earlier, using e^0.2985 ≈ 1.3478, which gave 32,347.20. So there's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponentiation steps. Let's check (1.01)^30 using a different method.

Alternatively, use the binomial theorem for approximation. But that might be too cumbersome. Alternatively, use logarithms and exponentials.

Wait, let's compute ln(1.01) ≈ 0.00995033. Then 30 * ln(1.01) ≈ 0.29851. Then e^0.29851 ≈ e^0.3 ≈ 1.349858, but 0.29851 is 0.3 - 0.00149. So e^0.29851 = e^(0.3 - 0.00149) = e^0.3 * e^-0.00149 ≈ 1.349858 * (1 - 0.00149) ≈ 1.349858 * 0.99851 ≈ 1.3472

So (1.01)^30 ≈ 1.3472. Then 24000 * 1.3472 = ?

24000 * 1.3 = 31200

24000 * 0.0472 = 24000 * 0.04 = 960; 24000 * 0.0072 = 172.8

So 960 + 172.8 = 1132.8

Total amount: 31200 + 1132.8 = 32332.8

So approximately $32,332.80. Hmm, so this is different from previous estimates. 

But why the discrepancy? It seems that different methods give slightly different results. Maybe the exact value requires more precise calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps using semi-annual compounding formula? Wait, no, the compounding is bi-monthly at 1% each period. So each two months, 1% interest. So the formula is indeed A = P*(1 + 0.01)^30.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator would give the exact value. Since I can't use a calculator here, maybe I can try to compute (1.01)^30 more accurately.

Let me try to compute (1.01)^30 step by step, multiplying each time:

Start with 1.01.

After 1 period: 1.01

After 2 periods: 1.01 * 1.01 = 1.0201

After 3: 1.0201 * 1.01 = 1.030301

After 4: 1.030301 * 1.01 ≈ 1.04060401

After 5: 1.04060401 * 1.01 ≈ 1.05101005

After 6: 1.05101005 * 1.01 ≈ 1.06152015

After 7: 1.06152015 * 1.01 ≈ 1.07213535

After 8: 1.07213535 * 1.01 ≈ 1.08285671

After 9: 1.08285671 * 1.01 ≈ 1.09368528

After 10: 1.09368528 * 1.01 ≈ 1.10462213

After 11: 1.10462213 * 1.01 ≈ 1.11566835

After 12: 1.11566835 * 1.01 ≈ 1.12682493

After 13: 1.12682493 * 1.01 ≈ 1.13809318

After 14: 1.13809318 * 1.01 ≈ 1.14957411

After 15: 1.14957411 * 1.01 ≈ 1.16106985

After 16: 1.16106985 * 1.01 ≈ 1.17268055

After 17: 1.17268055 * 1.01 ≈ 1.18440736

After 18: 1.18440736 * 1.01 ≈ 1.19625143

After 19: 1.19625143 * 1.01 ≈ 1.20821394

After 20: 1.20821394 * 1.01 ≈ 1.22029608

After 21: 1.22029608 * 1.01 ≈ 1.23249904

After 22: 1.23249904 * 1.01 ≈ 1.24482303

After 23: 1.24482303 * 1.01 ≈ 1.25727126

After 24: 1.25727126 * 1.01 ≈ 1.26994397

After 25: 1.26994397 * 1.01 ≈ 1.28264341

After 26: 1.28264341 * 1.01 ≈ 1.29546984

After 27: 1.29546984 * 1.01 ≈ 1.30842454

After 28: 1.30842454 * 1.01 ≈ 1.32150878

After 29: 1.32150878 * 1.01 ≈ 1.33472387

After 30: 1.33472387 * 1.01 ≈ 1.34807111

So after 30 periods, (1.01)^30 ≈ 1.34807111. Therefore, the total amount is 24000 * 1.34807111 ≈ ?

Calculating 24000 * 1.34807111:

First, 24000 * 1 = 24000

24000 * 0.34807111 ≈ 24000 * 0.3 = 7200; 24000 * 0.04807111 ≈ 24000 * 0.04 = 960; 24000 * 0.00807111 ≈ 24000 * 0.008 = 192; 24000 * 0.00007111 ≈ ~1.70664

Adding those up: 7200 + 960 = 8160; 8160 + 192 = 8352; 8352 + 1.70664 ≈ 8353.70664

Total amount ≈ 24000 + 8353.70664 ≈ 32353.70664

So approximately $32,353.71. 

But let's check this with another method. Since (1.01)^30 ≈ 1.34807111, multiplying by 24000 gives 24000 * 1.34807111. Let's compute 24000 * 1.3 = 31200, 24000 * 0.04807111 ≈ 24000 * 0.04 = 960; 24000 * 0.00807111 ≈ 193.70664. So total is 31200 + 960 + 193.70664 ≈ 31200 + 1153.70664 ≈ 32353.70664. Yes, that's consistent.

But let me verify this using another approach. Let's use the formula for compound interest:

A = P(1 + r)^n

P = $24,000

r = 1% per period = 0.01

n = 30 periods

So A = 24000*(1.01)^30 ≈ 24000*1.34807111 ≈ 32,353.70664

So approximately $32,353.71. Since the question says to the nearest whole number, we need to round this to the nearest dollar. 

Looking at the decimal part, 0.70664 is approximately 0.71, which is more than 0.5, so we round up. Therefore, the total amount is $32,354.

But let me confirm once again with a different calculation. Let's compute (1.01)^30 using logarithms.

ln(1.01) ≈ 0.00995033

Multiply by 30: 0.00995033 * 30 ≈ 0.29851

Exponentiate: e^0.29851 ≈ 1.34785 (from previous approximations)

But earlier, by step-by-step multiplication, we got 1.34807111. These are very close. The difference is minimal. So when we multiply 24000 by 1.34807111, we get approximately 32,353.71, which rounds to 32,354.

Alternatively, maybe the exact value is 32,353.70664, so rounding to the nearest whole number is 32,354. But perhaps the precise calculation gives a slightly different decimal. Let me check with a calculator (pretending to use one).

If I calculate (1.01)^30:

Using a calculator: 1.01^30 = approximately 1.3478489153. Then 24000 * 1.3478489153 ≈ 24000 * 1.3478489153.

Calculating 24000 * 1.3478489153:

First, 24000 * 1 = 24000

24000 * 0.3478489153 ≈ 24000 * 0.3 = 7200; 24000 * 0.0478489153 ≈ 24000 * 0.04 = 960; 24000 * 0.0078489153 ≈ 24000 * 0.007 = 168; 24000 * 0.0008489153 ≈ 20.374.

Adding up:

7200 + 960 = 8160

8160 + 168 = 8328

8328 + 20.374 ≈ 8348.374

Total amount: 24000 + 8348.374 ≈ 32348.374

Wait, that's conflicting with the previous result. Wait, no, because 0.3478489153 is the decimal part. Wait, 0.3478489153 * 24000 = 24000 * 0.3478489153 ≈ 8348.374

So total is 24000 + 8348.374 ≈ 32348.374, which is approximately $32,348.37. So rounding to the nearest whole number is $32,348.

But this is conflicting with the previous calculation. There's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the step-by-step multiplication earlier. Let's recalculate (1.01)^30 again.

Wait, step-by-step multiplication up to 30 periods:

After 1 period: 1.01

2: 1.0201

3: 1.030301

4: 1.04060401

5: 1.05101005

6: 1.06152015

7: 1.07213535

8: 1.08285671

9: 1.09368528

10: 1.10462213

11: 1.11566835

12: 1.12682493

13: 1.13809318

14: 1.14957411

15: 1.16106985

16: 1.17268055

17: 1.18440736

18: 1.19625143

19: 1.20821394

20: 1.22029608

21: 1.23249904

22: 1.24482303

23: 1.25727126

24: 1.26994397

25: 1.28264341

26: 1.29546984

27: 1.30842454

28: 1.32150878

29: 1.33472387

30: 1.34807111

So (1.01)^30 is approximately 1.34807111. Therefore, 24000 * 1.34807111 = 24000 * 1.34807111.

Calculating 24000 * 1.34807111:

First, 24000 * 1 = 24000

24000 * 0.34807111 = ?

0.34807111 * 24000:

0.3 * 24000 = 7200

0.04807111 * 24000 = 0.04 * 24000 = 960; 0.00807111 * 24000 ≈ 193.70664

So 960 + 193.70664 ≈ 1153.70664

Therefore, total is 7200 + 1153.70664 ≈ 8353.70664

Adding to 24000: 24000 + 8353.70664 ≈ 32353.70664

So approximately $32,353.71, which rounds to $32,354.

But why is there a discrepancy when using the logarithmic method? Because when I used the logarithmic approximation, I got 1.3478, which would lead to 32,348.37. However, the step-by-step multiplication gives 1.34807, leading to 32,353.71. The difference is about $5. So which one is correct?

Looking up the exact value using a calculator: (1.01)^30 = approximately 1.34784891534. Then 24000 * 1.34784891534 ≈ 24000 * 1.34784891534. Let's compute this precisely.

First, 24000 * 1.34784891534:

Break down 1.34784891534 into 1 + 0.3 + 0.04 + 0.007 + 0.00084891534.

So:

24000 * 1 = 24000

24000 * 0.3 = 7200

24000 * 0.04 = 960

24000 * 0.007 = 168

24000 * 0.00084891534 ≈ 24000 * 0.0008 = 19.2; 24000 * 0.00004891534 ≈ ~1.174

Adding these up:

24000 + 7200 = 31200

31200 + 960 = 32160

32160 + 168 = 32328

32328 + 19.2 ≈ 32347.2

32347.2 + 1.174 ≈ 32348.374

So total amount ≈ $32,348.37. 

Therefore, the exact value is approximately $32,348.37, which rounds to $32,348. 

But why the step-by-step multiplication gave $32,353.71? Because in the step-by-step multiplication, we calculated (1.01)^30 as approximately 1.34807111, which is slightly higher than the exact value of 1.34784891534. Therefore, the difference is due to rounding errors in the step-by-step multiplication. Each time we multiply, we round to a certain decimal place, which introduces a slight error. 

Therefore, the precise calculation using a calculator gives (1.01)^30 ≈ 1.34784891534, leading to 24000 * 1.34784891534 ≈ 32,348.37. 

Thus, rounding to the nearest whole number, the total amount is $32,348.

But to ensure accuracy, let's use the exact exponentiation:

(1.01)^30 ≈ e^(30 * ln(1.01)) ≈ e^(30 * 0.00995033) ≈ e^(0.29851) ≈ 1.34784891534.

Therefore, 24000 * 1.34784891534 = 24000 * 1.34784891534.

Calculating:

24000 * 1 = 24000

24000 * 0.34784891534 = ?

0.3 * 24000 = 7200

0.04784891534 * 24000 = 0.04 * 24000 = 960; 0.00784891534 * 24000 ≈ 188.374

So 960 + 188.374 ≈ 1148.374

Total: 7200 + 1148.374 ≈ 8348.374

Therefore, total amount ≈ 24000 + 8348.374 ≈ 32348.374

Rounded to the nearest whole number: $32,348.

Therefore, the final answer is $\boxed{32348}$.
