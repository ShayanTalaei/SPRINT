Okay, so I need to find the probability that three randomly chosen points from a 3x3 grid all lie on the same straight line. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.

First, the grid is a 3x3 grid, which means there are 9 points in total. The Asymptote code given draws a grid with points at coordinates (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). So, the grid points are arranged in three rows and three columns.

The problem states that we are choosing three points randomly from this grid, and each set of three points has an equal probability of being chosen. We need to find the probability that these three points lie on the same straight line. 

Probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways to choose 3 points out of 9, and the number of favorable outcomes is the number of sets of 3 points that lie on a straight line.

Let me break this down into steps:

1. Calculate the total number of ways to choose 3 points from 9.
2. Determine how many of these combinations lie on a straight line.
3. Divide the number from step 2 by the number from step 1 to get the probability.

Starting with step 1: The total number of ways to choose 3 points from 9 is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k! (n - k)!). Here, n = 9 and k = 3. So, C(9, 3) = 9! / (3! * 6!) = (9 * 8 * 7) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 84. So, there are 84 possible sets of three points.

Now, step 2: Counting the number of sets of three collinear points. This seems a bit trickier. I need to consider all possible straight lines that can be drawn through three points in the 3x3 grid. Let's think about the different types of lines possible.

First, the rows of the grid. Each row has three points. There are three rows, so each row gives one set of three collinear points. Similarly, each column has three points, and there are three columns, so that's another three sets. So that's 3 + 3 = 6 so far.

Then, there are the two main diagonals. The main diagonal from (0,0) to (2,2) and the other diagonal from (0,2) to (2,0). Each of these diagonals also has three points, so that's two more sets. So, now we have 6 + 2 = 8.

But wait, are there any other lines with three points that aren't rows, columns, or main diagonals? Hmm. Let me visualize the grid.

Looking at the grid, are there any other lines with three points? For example, lines that are not aligned with the grid but still pass through three points. Let's check.

Consider a line with a slope of 1 starting from (0,1). That would pass through (0,1), (1,2), but then the next point would be (2,3), which is outside the grid. So, that's only two points. Similarly, a line with slope 2 starting from (0,0) would go through (0,0), (1,2), but the next point would be (2,4), which is outside. So, only two points.

What about lines with a slope of 1/2? Starting from (0,0), the next point would be (2,1), but there's no point at (4,2), so only two points. How about starting from (1,0)? A line with slope 1 would go through (1,0), (2,1), but beyond that is (3,2), which is outside. So, again, only two points.

How about lines with a slope of -1? Starting from (0,2), going to (1,1), (2,0). That's the main diagonal, which we already counted. Any other line with slope -1? Starting from (0,1), going to (1,0), but the next point would be (2,-1), which is outside. So, only two points.

What about other slopes? Let's think. Suppose a line with slope 2/1, but that's the same as a slope of 2. We already checked that.

Alternatively, a line with slope 1/1, which is slope 1, already covered.

Wait, maybe there's a line that isn't aligned with the grid but still passes through three points. For example, a knight's move in chess. But in a 3x3 grid, moving two in one direction and one in the other might not land on three points. Let me see.

Starting from (0,0), moving two right and one up would land at (2,1), but then moving another two right and one up would go beyond the grid. So only two points. Similarly, starting from (0,1), moving two right and one up would go to (2,2), but then another two right and one up would be beyond. So, again, two points.

How about starting from (0,0), moving one right and two up? That would go to (1,2), but then moving again would go to (2,4), which is outside. So, only two points.

Alternatively, starting from (0,1), moving one right and one up? That would go to (1,2), then (2,3), which is outside. Again, two points.

Alternatively, starting from (1,0), moving two right and one up. That would go to (3,1), which is outside. So, only two points.

Hmm. It seems like all other possible lines with different slopes either pass through two points or just one. So, there are no other lines with three points. Therefore, the only lines with three points are the rows, columns, and the two main diagonals.

Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is 8. Wait, 3 rows, 3 columns, 2 diagonals: 3 + 3 + 2 = 8. So, 8 lines, each contributing one set of three collinear points. Therefore, there are 8 favorable sets.

Wait, but hold on. Let me verify again. Each row is a horizontal line, each column is a vertical line, and the two diagonals. So, that's 3 + 3 + 2 = 8. So, 8 sets. Therefore, the probability is 8 / 84, which simplifies to 2 / 21. But wait, is that correct?

Wait, hold on. Let me check again. The grid is 3x3, so rows: 3, columns: 3, diagonals: 2. So, 3 + 3 + 2 = 8. But is that all? Are there any other lines with three points?

Wait, for example, the lines that are not horizontal, vertical, or main diagonals. For example, the line through (0,1), (1,0), (2,1). Wait, does this line pass through three points?

Wait, (0,1), (1,0), (2,1). Let me check if these three points are colinear. The slope between (0,1) and (1,0) is (0 - 1)/(1 - 0) = -1. Then between (1,0) and (2,1): (1 - 0)/(2 - 1) = 1. So, the slopes are different, hence not colinear. So, that's two points, not three.

Another example: (0,0), (1,2), (2,1). Let's check. Slope between (0,0) and (1,2) is 2. Slope between (1,2) and (2,1) is (1 - 2)/(2 - 1) = -1. Not the same slope, so not colinear.

How about (0,1), (1,2), (2,1)? Let's check slopes. Between (0,1) and (1,2): slope is 1. Between (1,2) and (2,1): slope is -1. Different slopes, so not colinear.

Alternatively, (1,0), (2,1), (3,2): but (3,2) is outside the grid. So, only two points.

Wait, let me check another possible line. How about the line through (0,0), (1,1), (2,2). That's the main diagonal, which we already counted. Similarly, the other diagonal.

Wait, maybe there's a line with three points that's not aligned with the grid. For example, the line that passes through (0,1), (1,1), (2,1). Wait, that's a horizontal line, which we already counted as a row.

Wait, so maybe all lines with three points in the grid are accounted for by the rows, columns, and two main diagonals. Therefore, the total number of favorable combinations is 8.

But wait, hold on. Let me check again. Let's list all possible lines with three points.

Rows:

1. (0,0), (0,1), (0,2)

2. (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)

3. (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)

Columns:

4. (0,0), (1,0), (2,0)

5. (0,1), (1,1), (2,1)

6. (0,2), (1,2), (2,2)

Diagonals:

7. (0,0), (1,1), (2,2)

8. (0,2), (1,1), (2,0)

Yes, that's 8 lines. Each of these lines contains exactly three points. So, there are 8 favorable combinations.

Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is 8, total possible is 84. Therefore, the probability is 8/84. Simplifying that, divide numerator and denominator by 4: 2/21. So, the probability is 2/21.

Wait, but let me think again. Is there any other line with three points that I might have missed? For example, maybe a line with a different slope that passes through three grid points.

Wait, consider the line that goes through (0,0), (1,1), (2,2). That's the main diagonal. Similarly, the other diagonal. Are there any other lines?

Wait, another possible line: for example, starting at (0,0), going through (1,2), (2,1). Wait, does that form a straight line? Let's check.

Coordinates:

(0,0), (1,2), (2,1)

Let's calculate the slope between (0,0) and (1,2): (2 - 0)/(1 - 0) = 2.

Slope between (1,2) and (2,1): (1 - 2)/(2 - 1) = -1. Since the slopes are different, these three points are not colinear.

Similarly, (0,1), (1,0), (2,1). Slope between (0,1) and (1,0) is -1. Slope between (1,0) and (2,1) is 1. Not colinear.

Another possible line: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0). That's a column, which we already counted.

Wait, maybe a line with slope 1/3? For example, starting at (0,0), then (3,1), but that's outside. Similarly, starting at (0,1), moving to (3,2), outside. So, no.

Alternatively, starting at (0,0), moving two right and one up: (2,1), but then next would be (4,2), which is outside. So, only two points.

Alternatively, starting at (0,1), moving two right and one up: (2,2). Then next would be (4,3), which is outside. So, only two points.

So, it seems like all possible lines with three points are indeed the rows, columns, and the two main diagonals. Therefore, 8 lines in total.

Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is 8, total possible is 84. So, probability is 8/84 = 2/21.

But wait, let me check again with another approach. Maybe counting all possible lines.

In a 3x3 grid, how many lines are there in total that pass through at least three points?

The rows: 3 lines.

The columns: 3 lines.

The main diagonals: 2 lines.

Total: 8 lines. Each of these lines has exactly three points. So, the number of collinear triplets is 8.

Therefore, the probability is 8/84 = 2/21. That would be the answer.

Wait, but let me confirm once more. Let's think of all possible triplets. There are 84. How many of them are colinear?

Each row: 1 line with 3 points. The number of triplets in each row is C(3,3) = 1. So, 3 rows contribute 3 triplets.

Similarly, each column: 3 columns, each contributing 1 triplet. So, 3 more triplets.

Each diagonal: 2 diagonals, each contributing 1 triplet. So, 2 more triplets.

Total triplets: 3 + 3 + 2 = 8. So, that's correct.

Therefore, 8 favorable triplets out of 84. So, 8/84 simplifies to 2/21.

Therefore, the probability is 2/21.

But wait, hold on. Let me check if there are any other lines with three points. For example, suppose we take a line that is not aligned with the grid but still passes through three points. For example, the line that goes through (0,0), (1,1), (2,2). That's the main diagonal. Similarly, the other diagonal. So, those are already counted.

Is there any other line? Let's consider the lines with slope 2: for example, starting at (0,0), then (1,2). Then, the next point would be (2,4), which is outside. So, only two points. Similarly, starting at (0,1), slope 2 would go to (1,3), which is outside. So, no.

Another slope: 1/2. Starting at (0,0), slope 1/2 would go to (2,1). Then next point would be (4,2), outside. So, only two points.

Slope -1: Starting at (0,2), going to (1,1), (2,0). That's the main diagonal. So, already counted.

Slope -2: Starting at (0,2), next point would be (1,0), then (2,-2), which is outside. So, only two points.

Slope 1/3: From (0,0) to (3,1), outside. So, two points.

Slope 3: From (0,0) to (1,3), outside. So, two points.

So, no other lines with three grid points. Therefore, the answer is 2/21.

But wait, let me check with an alternative method. Let's list all possible triplets that are colinear.

First, rows:

1. (0,0), (0,1), (0,2)

2. (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)

3. (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)

Columns:

4. (0,0), (1,0), (2,0)

5. (0,1), (1,1), (2,1)

6. (0,2), (1,2), (2,2)

Diagonals:

7. (0,0), (1,1), (2,2)

8. (0,2), (1,1), (2,0)

So, that's 8 triplets. Each of these is a set of three collinear points. So, 8 favorable outcomes.

Therefore, the probability is 8/84 = 2/21.

Hence, the answer is 2/21.

**Final Answer**
The probability is \boxed{\dfrac{2}{21}}.
Thus, the probability that the three points lie on the same straight line is $\boxed{\frac{2}{21}}$.
