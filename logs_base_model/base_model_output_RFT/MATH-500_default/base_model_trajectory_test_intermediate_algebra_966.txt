Okay, so I need to find the minimum value of the expression \(x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4\) given that \(xyz = 2\), where \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) are positive real numbers. Hmm, this looks like an optimization problem with a constraint. I remember that for optimization problems with constraints, methods like Lagrange multipliers can be useful. Alternatively, maybe I can use the AM-GM inequality since the variables are positive. Let me think through both approaches.

First, let me recall the AM-GM inequality. The Arithmetic Mean is greater than or equal to the Geometric Mean. For non-negative real numbers, that's the key. So if I can express the given expression in terms of terms that can be directly compared using AM-GM, that might work. But the expression here has different exponents: \(x^4\), \(y^2\), and \(z^4\). Maybe I can split these into multiple terms so that the number of terms is the same as the number of variables in the constraint.

Wait, the constraint is \(xyz = 2\). That's a product equal to 2. So if I can somehow relate the terms in the expression to this product, maybe through substitution or by breaking down the terms into parts that multiply to something related to 2.

Alternatively, using Lagrange multipliers: set up the function \(f(x, y, z) = x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4\) and the constraint \(g(x, y, z) = xyz - 2 = 0\). Then, the method says that at the extremum, the gradient of f is proportional to the gradient of g. So, compute the partial derivatives.

Let me try that. The partial derivatives of f are:

\(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 4x^3\)

\(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 8y\)

\(\frac{\partial f}{\partial z} = 16z^3\)

The partial derivatives of g are:

\(\frac{\partial g}{\partial x} = yz\)

\(\frac{\partial g}{\partial y} = xz\)

\(\frac{\partial g}{\partial z} = xy\)

So according to Lagrange multipliers, there exists a λ such that:

4x^3 = λyz

8y = λxz

16z^3 = λxy

And the constraint is xyz = 2.

Hmm, so now we have a system of equations. Let me write them down:

1. \(4x^3 = λyz\)

2. \(8y = λxz\)

3. \(16z^3 = λxy\)

4. \(xyz = 2\)

I need to solve this system for x, y, z, λ. Let me see if I can eliminate λ first.

From equation 1: λ = 4x^3 / (yz)

From equation 2: λ = 8y / (xz)

So set them equal:

4x^3 / (yz) = 8y / (xz)

Multiply both sides by yz * xz to eliminate denominators:

4x^3 * xz = 8y * yz

Simplify left side: 4x^4 z

Right side: 8y^2 z

So 4x^4 z = 8y^2 z

Divide both sides by z (since z ≠ 0):

4x^4 = 8y^2

Divide both sides by 4:

x^4 = 2y^2

Take square roots (since x and y are positive):

x^2 = √2 y

So y = x^2 / √2

Similarly, take equation 2 and equation 3 to eliminate λ.

From equation 2: λ = 8y / (xz)

From equation 3: λ = 16z^3 / (xy)

Set them equal:

8y / (xz) = 16z^3 / (xy)

Multiply both sides by xz * xy to eliminate denominators:

8y * xy = 16z^3 * xz

Left side: 8x y^2

Right side: 16x z^4

So 8x y^2 = 16x z^4

Divide both sides by 8x (since x ≠ 0):

y^2 = 2 z^4

Take square roots:

y = √(2) z^2

But from earlier, y = x^2 / √2

So set equal:

x^2 / √2 = √2 z^2

Multiply both sides by √2:

x^2 = 2 z^2

So x = z √2

So now, we have relationships between x, y, z:

y = x^2 / √2

x = z √2

So let's express everything in terms of z.

First, x = z √2

Then, y = ( (z √2 )^2 ) / √2 = (2 z^2) / √2 = √2 z^2

So x = z √2, y = √2 z^2, z = z

Now, use the constraint xyz = 2.

Compute x * y * z:

(z √2) * (√2 z^2) * z = (z √2) * (√2 z^2) * z

Multiply constants: √2 * √2 = 2

Multiply variables: z * z^2 * z = z^4

So total: 2 * z^4 = 2

Therefore, 2 z^4 = 2 => z^4 = 1 => z = 1 (since z is positive)

Thus, z = 1

Therefore, x = √2 * 1 = √2

y = √2 * (1)^2 = √2

So x = √2, y = √2, z = 1

Now compute the original expression:

x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4

x^4 = (√2)^4 = (2)^{2} = 4

4y^2 = 4*(√2)^2 = 4*2 = 8

4z^4 = 4*(1)^4 = 4

Total: 4 + 8 + 4 = 16

So the minimum value is 16.

Wait, but let me check if this is indeed the minimum. Maybe there's a way to confirm this using AM-GM.

Alternatively, let's see if the partial derivatives line up. With x = √2, y = √2, z = 1:

Compute λ from equation 1: 4x^3 / (yz) = 4*(√2)^3 / (√2*1) = 4*(2√2) / √2 = 4*2 = 8

From equation 2: 8y / (xz) = 8*√2 / (√2*1) = 8*√2 / √2 = 8

From equation 3: 16z^3 / (xy) = 16*1 / (√2*√2) = 16 / 2 = 8

So λ is consistent as 8. So that seems correct.

Alternatively, let me try AM-GM. Since the expression has x^4, 4y^2, 4z^4, maybe I can split them into equal terms.

But the coefficients are different: 1 for x^4, 4 for y^2, 4 for z^4.

Alternatively, perhaps write 4y^2 as y^2 + y^2 + y^2 + y^2 and 4z^4 as z^4 + z^4 + z^4 + z^4. Then, total terms would be 1 + 4 + 4 = 9 terms. But then the product of these terms would be x^4 * y^2 * y^2 * y^2 * y^2 * z^4 * z^4 * z^4 * z^4.

Wait, but the product of all terms would be x^4 * y^8 * z^{16}. But from the constraint, xyz = 2. So x^4 * y^8 * z^{16} = (xyz)^4 * y^4 * z^{12} = 2^4 * y^4 * z^{12}. Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe group the terms differently. Let me see.

Suppose I group the terms as follows:

x^4 and 4y^2 and 4z^4. Maybe think of x^4 as x^4, 4y^2 as 2y^2 + 2y^2, and 4z^4 as 2z^4 + 2z^4. Then, total terms are 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 9 terms? Wait, not sure. Maybe not the right approach.

Alternatively, use the weighted AM-GM inequality. The weighted AM-GM states that for positive real numbers and positive weights summing to 1, the weighted arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the weighted geometric mean.

But in this case, the exponents are different. Let me think. The expression is x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4. Let me represent this as a sum of terms with equal coefficients.

Alternatively, maybe split x^4 into four terms of x^4/4 each, 4y^2 into two terms of 2y^2 each, and 4z^4 into four terms of z^4 each. Then total terms would be 4 + 2 + 4 = 10 terms. Then apply AM-GM.

But then the product of all terms would be (x^4/4)^4 * (2y^2)^2 * (z^4)^4 = (x^16 / 4^4) * (4y^4) * (z^{16}) = x^16 z^{16} * 4y^4 / 256 = x^16 z^{16} y^4 / 64.

But from the constraint xyz = 2, so x^16 z^{16} y^4 = (xyz)^4 * x^{12} z^{12} = 2^4 * x^{12} z^{12}.

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe this approach is too convoluted.

Alternatively, maybe use substitution. Let me set a = x^2, b = y^2, c = z^2. Then the expression becomes a^2 + 4b + 4c^2. The constraint is sqrt(a) * sqrt(b) * sqrt(c) = 2, so sqrt(abc) = 2, so abc = 4.

So now we need to minimize a^2 + 4b + 4c^2 with abc = 4.

Hmm, now maybe apply AM-GM here. Let me see.

The expression is a^2 + 4b + 4c^2. Let me try to split these terms into parts so that the number of terms corresponds to the number of variables in the constraint.

Wait, the constraint is abc = 4. So three variables. The expression has three terms: a^2, 4b, 4c^2. Maybe split each term into equal parts.

For example, write a^2 as a^2, 4b as b + b + b + b, and 4c^2 as c^2 + c^2 + c^2 + c^2. Then total terms would be 1 + 4 + 4 = 9 terms. Then apply AM-GM on these 9 terms.

But then the product would be a^2 * b^4 * c^8. Not sure if that relates to the constraint abc = 4. Let's check:

Product of all terms: (a^2) * (b^4) * (c^8) = a^2 b^4 c^8. The constraint is abc = 4, so a = 4/(bc). Substitute:

( (4/(bc))^2 ) * b^4 * c^8 = (16 / b^2 c^2) * b^4 c^8 = 16 b^2 c^6.

But this is not necessarily a constant. Hmm, so maybe this approach isn't directly applicable.

Alternatively, maybe use weighted AM-GM. Let me recall that for positive numbers and positive weights, the weighted AM-GM states that:

(k1 * a1 + k2 * a2 + ... + kn * an) / (k1 + k2 + ... + kn) >= (a1^{k1} * a2^{k2} * ... * an^{kn})^{1/(k1 + k2 + ... + kn)}

But in our case, the expression is x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4. Let me see if I can represent this as a sum with weights.

Alternatively, think of the expression as 1*x^4 + 4*y^2 + 4*z^4. Then the total weight is 1 + 4 + 4 = 9. Then the weighted AM-GM would say that:

(1*x^4 + 4*y^2 + 4*z^4)/9 >= (x^4^1 * y^2^4 * z^4^4)^{1/9}

But the left side is (x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4)/9, and the right side is (x^4 * y^8 * z^{16})^{1/9} = (x^4 y^8 z^{16})^{1/9} = x^{4/9} y^{8/9} z^{16/9}

But from the constraint, xyz = 2. So let's express x^{4/9} y^{8/9} z^{16/9} as (xyz)^{4/9} * y^{8/9 - 4/9} * z^{16/9 - 4/9} = (2)^{4/9} * y^{4/9} * z^{12/9} = 2^{4/9} * y^{4/9} * z^{4/3}

Hmm, not sure if this is helpful. Maybe this approach is not the right one.

Alternatively, perhaps use the method of substituting variables. Since xyz = 2, maybe set x = 2a, y = 2b, z = 2c, such that abc = 1. But not sure if that helps.

Wait, maybe let's set variables in terms of each other. From earlier, with x = √2, y = √2, z = 1, that gives xyz = √2 * √2 * 1 = 2, which satisfies the constraint. So the values we found via Lagrange multipliers are correct. Therefore, the minimum value is 16.

Alternatively, let's check with another method. Suppose we fix z and then express x and y in terms of z. Then use substitution.

From the constraint, xyz = 2 => x = 2/(y z). Substitute into the expression:

x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4 = (2/(y z))^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4

= 16/(y^4 z^4) + 4y^2 + 4z^4

Now, this is a function of y and z. Maybe take partial derivatives with respect to y and z, set to zero.

But this might get complicated. Alternatively, fix z and see if the expression is convex in y.

Alternatively, set t = y z. Then, from x = 2/(y z) = 2/t. Then the expression becomes (2/t)^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4.

But still, not sure. Alternatively, maybe set u = y z. Then x = 2/u. Then the expression becomes (2/u)^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4. But then we have to relate y and z. Maybe set y = k z, where k is a positive real number. Then y = k z, so u = k z^2. Then x = 2/(k z^2). Then the expression becomes:

(2/(k z^2))^4 + 4(k z)^2 + 4z^4 = 16/(k^4 z^8) + 4k^2 z^2 + 4z^4

Now, this is a function of z and k. Maybe take derivative with respect to z. Let me see:

Let’s denote f(z) = 16/(k^4 z^8) + 4k^2 z^2 + 4z^4

Take derivative with respect to z:

f’(z) = -128/(k^4 z^9) + 8k^2 z + 16z^3

Set to zero:

-128/(k^4 z^9) + 8k^2 z + 16z^3 = 0

Multiply both sides by z^9 to eliminate denominator:

-128/(k^4) + 8k^2 z^{10} + 16z^{12} = 0

Hmm, this seems messy. Maybe this substitution is not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps consider symmetry. Since in the optimal solution we found, x = √2, y = √2, z = 1, so x = y, but z is different. Maybe the minimal point has some symmetry. Let me assume that x = y. Then, with x = y, the constraint becomes x^2 z = 2 => z = 2/(x^2). Then substitute into the expression:

x^4 + 4x^2 + 4z^4 = x^4 + 4x^2 + 4*(2/(x^2))^4 = x^4 + 4x^2 + 4*(16)/(x^8) = x^4 + 4x^2 + 64/x^8

Now, take derivative with respect to x:

4x^3 + 8x - 512/x^9

Set to zero:

4x^3 + 8x - 512/x^9 = 0

Multiply both sides by x^9:

4x^{12} + 8x^{10} - 512 = 0

Divide by 4:

x^{12} + 2x^{10} - 128 = 0

This seems difficult to solve. Maybe not the right approach. Alternatively, if we assume that x and y are proportional to z in some way, but that might not lead anywhere.

Alternatively, let's check the value we found earlier: x = √2, y = √2, z = 1. Then, substituting into the original expression:

x^4 = (√2)^4 = 4

4y^2 = 4*(√2)^2 = 4*2 = 8

4z^4 = 4*(1)^4 = 4

Total: 4 + 8 + 4 = 16. So that's the value. Let me check if there's a way to get a lower value.

Suppose I take x = 2, y = 1, z = 1. Then xyz = 2*1*1 = 2. The expression becomes 2^4 + 4*1^2 + 4*1^4 = 16 + 4 + 4 = 24, which is higher than 16.

Another example: x = 1, y = 2, z = 1. Then xyz = 1*2*1 = 2. The expression is 1^4 + 4*2^2 + 4*1^4 = 1 + 16 + 4 = 21, which is still higher.

What if I take x = √2, y = √2, z = 1. Then, as before, 4 + 8 + 4 = 16. If I take x slightly different, say x = √2 + ε, then y and z would adjust accordingly. Let me see.

But according to the Lagrange multipliers, that's the only critical point, so it's a minimum. Therefore, the answer is 16.

Alternatively, maybe use the method of substitution again. Let me try to write the expression in terms of one variable.

From the constraint, xyz = 2. Let me set t = x^2. Then, since x is positive, t is positive. Then, the constraint becomes sqrt(t) * y * z = 2 => y z = 2 / sqrt(t).

Let me express y in terms of z: y = (2 / sqrt(t)) / z = 2 / (z sqrt(t)).

Substitute into the expression:

x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4 = t^2 + 4*(4 / (z^2 t)) + 4z^4 = t^2 + 16/(t z^2) + 4z^4

Now, let me set u = z^2. Then, the expression becomes t^2 + 16/(t u) + 4u^2

From the constraint, y z = 2 / sqrt(t) => y = 2 / (z sqrt(t)) => y = 2 / (sqrt(u) sqrt(t)) => y = 2 / sqrt(t u). But since y is positive, that's fine.

But wait, with t and u, we have the expression in terms of t and u: t^2 + 16/(t u) + 4u^2. But u is related to z, which is another variable. Hmm, maybe this substitution isn't helpful.

Alternatively, let me try to fix t and then optimize over u. Let's take the expression t^2 + 16/(t u) + 4u^2. To minimize this with respect to u, take derivative with respect to u:

d/du [ t^2 + 16/(t u) + 4u^2 ] = -16/(t u^2) + 8u

Set to zero:

-16/(t u^2) + 8u = 0 => 8u = 16/(t u^2) => 8u^3 = 16/t => u^3 = 2/t => u = (2/t)^{1/3}

So at minimum, u = (2/t)^{1/3}

Therefore, substitute back into the expression:

t^2 + 16/(t * (2/t)^{1/3}) + 4*( (2/t)^{1/3} )^2

Simplify:

First term: t^2

Second term: 16 / (t * (2/t)^{1/3}) = 16 / ( t^{1 - 1/3} * 2^{1/3} ) = 16 / ( t^{2/3} * 2^{1/3} ) = 16 / (2^{1/3}) * t^{-2/3} = 16 / 2^{1/3} * t^{-2/3}

Third term: 4 * (2/t)^{2/3} = 4 * 2^{2/3} * t^{-2/3}

Thus, the expression becomes:

t^2 + (16 / 2^{1/3}) t^{-2/3} + 4 * 2^{2/3} t^{-2/3}

Combine the second and third terms:

[16 / 2^{1/3} + 4 * 2^{2/3}] t^{-2/3}

Factor out 4 * 2^{2/3}:

4 * 2^{2/3} [ (16 / 2^{1/3}) / (4 * 2^{2/3}) ) + 1 ] t^{-2/3}

Wait, maybe just compute the coefficients:

16 / 2^{1/3} = 16 * 2^{-1/3}

4 * 2^{2/3} = 4 * 2^{2/3}

So combined:

16 * 2^{-1/3} + 4 * 2^{2/3} = 4 * 2^{-1/3} * (4 + 2^{5/3})

Hmm, not sure. Maybe better to compute numerical values:

2^{1/3} ≈ 1.26

So 16 / 1.26 ≈ 12.7

4 * 2^{2/3} ≈ 4 * 1.587 ≈ 6.348

So total ≈ 12.7 + 6.348 ≈ 19.048

So the expression is t^2 + 19.048 t^{-2/3}

Now, we need to minimize this in terms of t > 0. Let's take derivative with respect to t:

2t - (2/3) * 19.048 t^{-5/3}

Set to zero:

2t = (2/3) * 19.048 t^{-5/3}

Multiply both sides by t^{5/3}:

2t^{8/3} = (2/3) * 19.048

Divide both sides by 2:

t^{8/3} = (19.048)/3 ≈ 6.349

Take both sides to the power of 3/8:

t = (6.349)^{3/8}

Compute 6.349^{3/8}:

First, 6.349^(1/8) ≈ e^{(ln 6.349)/8} ≈ e^{1.85/8} ≈ e^{0.231} ≈ 1.26

Then, 1.26^3 ≈ 2.000

So t ≈ 2.000

Therefore, t ≈ 2

Therefore, u = (2/t)^{1/3} ≈ (2/2)^{1/3} = 1^{1/3} = 1

Therefore, z^2 = u = 1 => z = 1

Then, y = 2 / (z sqrt(t)) = 2 / (1 * sqrt(2)) = sqrt(2)

x = sqrt(t) = sqrt(2)

So we end up with x = sqrt(2), y = sqrt(2), z = 1, which matches the earlier result.

Therefore, the minimal value is 16.

Thus, after multiple approaches—Lagrange multipliers, substitution, checking specific values, even trying AM-GM with substitution—it seems that the minimal value is indeed 16. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 16.

**Final Answer**
