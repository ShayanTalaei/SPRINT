Okay, so I need to find the area of an equiangular octagon where four sides are length 1 and four sides are length √2/2, arranged so that no two consecutive sides are the same length. Hmm, let me start by recalling some properties of equiangular octagons. Since it's equiangular, all the internal angles are equal. For a regular octagon, each internal angle is 135 degrees, right? Because the formula for internal angles is ((n-2)*180)/n, so (6*180)/8 = 135 degrees. So even though this isn't a regular octagon, all the angles are 135 degrees. 

The octagon is equiangular but not equilateral, which means the sides alternate between lengths 1 and √2/2. Since there are eight sides, four of each length. Also, the sides alternate, so no two consecutive sides are the same. Let me visualize this. Maybe it's like a stop sign but with alternating sides of different lengths. 

To find the area, maybe I can break the octagon into simpler shapes whose areas I can calculate and then add them up. Alternatively, since it's equiangular, perhaps I can use coordinate geometry by placing the octagon on a coordinate system and computing the coordinates of each vertex, then using the shoelace formula to find the area. That might work. Let me think about that approach.

First, let me set up a coordinate system. Let's place one vertex at the origin, and align the octagon so that one of its sides is along the x-axis. Since the sides alternate between lengths 1 and √2/2, the direction of each subsequent side will change by 45 degrees each time because the internal angle is 135 degrees. Wait, actually, the external angle would be 45 degrees since the internal angle is 135. The external angle is 180 - internal angle, so 45 degrees. So each turn between sides is 45 degrees. 

But since the octagon is equiangular, each turn is the same. So starting from the first side, each consecutive side is at a 45-degree angle from the previous one. However, the side lengths alternate between 1 and √2/2. So the octagon is like a regular octagon but with sides alternating between two lengths. 

Wait, but in a regular octagon, all sides are equal, so this is a modification of that. Maybe it's similar to a stretched or compressed regular octagon. But how?

Alternatively, maybe I can model the octagon as a combination of rectangles and triangles. Let me try to sketch it mentally. If I have sides alternating between 1 and √2/2, each side is followed by a 45-degree turn. So starting at the origin, moving right along the x-axis for length 1, then turning 45 degrees upwards to move for length √2/2, then turning another 45 degrees (total 90 degrees from the original direction) for length 1 again, and so on. 

But wait, if each turn is 45 degrees, then after eight sides, the total turning angle would be 8*45 = 360 degrees, which makes sense for a polygon. So each side is at a 45-degree angle from the previous one. But the side lengths alternate, so sides 1, 3, 5, 7 are length 1, and sides 2, 4, 6, 8 are length √2/2. 

Alternatively, maybe starting with a side of length 1, then √2/2, then 1, etc., alternating around the octagon. So the octagon has vertices connected by these alternating sides. 

If I can model the coordinates of each vertex, then I can apply the shoelace formula. Let's try that. Let me start at the origin (0,0). The first side is along the x-axis with length 1, so the next vertex is at (1,0). Then, the next side is of length √2/2 at a 45-degree angle from the previous side. Since the turn is 45 degrees, the direction of the second side is 45 degrees from the x-axis. So the displacement from the second vertex to the third is √2/2 * (cos(45°), sin(45°)). 

Calculating that, cos(45°) and sin(45°) are both √2/2, so the displacement components are (√2/2 * √2/2, √2/2 * √2/2) = (1/2, 1/2). So the third vertex is at (1 + 1/2, 0 + 1/2) = (3/2, 1/2). 

Then, the third side is of length 1 again. The previous direction was 45 degrees, so turning another 45 degrees makes the new direction 90 degrees from the x-axis, which is straight up along the y-axis. So the displacement is (0,1). Therefore, the fourth vertex is at (3/2, 1/2 + 1) = (3/2, 3/2). 

Fourth side is √2/2 again, turning another 45 degrees. The previous direction was 90 degrees, adding 45 gives 135 degrees. The displacement would be √2/2*(cos(135°), sin(135°)). Cos(135°) is -√2/2, sin(135°) is √2/2. So displacement components are (-1/2, 1/2). So fifth vertex is at (3/2 - 1/2, 3/2 + 1/2) = (1, 2). 

Fifth side is length 1. The previous direction was 135 degrees, so adding another 45 degrees gives 180 degrees. Displacement is (-1, 0). So sixth vertex is at (1 - 1, 2 + 0) = (0, 2). 

Sixth side is √2/2. Previous direction was 180 degrees, adding 45 gives 225 degrees. Displacement components: √2/2*(cos(225°), sin(225°)) = √2/2*(-√2/2, -√2/2) = (-1/2, -1/2). So seventh vertex is at (0 - 1/2, 2 - 1/2) = (-1/2, 3/2). 

Seventh side is length 1. Previous direction was 225 degrees, adding 45 gives 270 degrees. Displacement is (0, -1). Eighth vertex is at (-1/2, 3/2 - 1) = (-1/2, 1/2). 

Eighth side is √2/2. Previous direction was 270 degrees, adding 45 gives 315 degrees. Displacement components: √2/2*(cos(315°), sin(315°)) = √2/2*(√2/2, -√2/2) = (1/2, -1/2). So the ninth vertex, which should be the first vertex, is at (-1/2 + 1/2, 1/2 - 1/2) = (0, 0). Perfect, that closes the octagon. 

So the coordinates of the vertices are:
1. (0, 0)
2. (1, 0)
3. (3/2, 1/2)
4. (3/2, 3/2)
5. (1, 2)
6. (0, 2)
7. (-1/2, 3/2)
8. (-1/2, 1/2)
9. (0, 0) [closing the polygon]

Now, with these coordinates, I can apply the shoelace formula to compute the area. The shoelace formula is given by:

Area = 1/2 |sum_{i=1 to n} (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i)|

So let's list all the vertices in order:

1. (0, 0)
2. (1, 0)
3. (3/2, 1/2)
4. (3/2, 3/2)
5. (1, 2)
6. (0, 2)
7. (-1/2, 3/2)
8. (-1/2, 1/2)
9. (0, 0)

Let me compute each term (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i) for each i from 1 to 8:

Term 1 (i=1):
x1 y2 - x2 y1 = 0*0 - 1*0 = 0 - 0 = 0

Term 2 (i=2):
x2 y3 - x3 y2 = 1*(1/2) - (3/2)*0 = 1/2 - 0 = 1/2

Term 3 (i=3):
x3 y4 - x4 y3 = (3/2)*(3/2) - (3/2)*(1/2) = 9/4 - 3/4 = 6/4 = 3/2

Term 4 (i=4):
x4 y5 - x5 y4 = (3/2)*2 - 1*(3/2) = 3 - 3/2 = 3/2

Term 5 (i=5):
x5 y6 - x6 y5 = 1*2 - 0*2 = 2 - 0 = 2

Term 6 (i=6):
x6 y7 - x7 y6 = 0*(3/2) - (-1/2)*2 = 0 + 1 = 1

Term 7 (i=7):
x7 y8 - x8 y7 = (-1/2)*(1/2) - (-1/2)*(3/2) = (-1/4) - (-3/4) = (-1/4 + 3/4) = 2/4 = 1/2

Term 8 (i=8):
x8 y9 - x9 y8 = (-1/2)*0 - 0*(1/2) = 0 - 0 = 0

Now, sum all these terms:

0 + 1/2 + 3/2 + 3/2 + 2 + 1 + 1/2 + 0 = Let's compute step by step:

1/2 + 3/2 = 4/2 = 2

2 + 3/2 = 7/2

7/2 + 2 = 7/2 + 4/2 = 11/2

11/2 + 1 = 13/2

13/2 + 1/2 = 14/2 = 7

So the total sum is 7. Then the area is 1/2 * |7| = 7/2. So 3.5. Hmm, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check the calculations again, because 7/2 seems a bit large for an octagon with sides of length 1 and √2/2. Let me verify each term:

Term 1: 0*0 -1*0 = 0. Correct.

Term 2: 1*(1/2) - (3/2)*0 = 1/2. Correct.

Term 3: (3/2)*(3/2) - (3/2)*(1/2) = 9/4 - 3/4 = 6/4 = 3/2. Correct.

Term 4: (3/2)*2 -1*(3/2) = 3 - 3/2 = 3/2. Correct.

Term 5: 1*2 -0*2 = 2. Correct.

Term 6: 0*(3/2) - (-1/2)*2 = 0 +1 =1. Correct.

Term 7: (-1/2)*(1/2) - (-1/2)*(3/2) = (-1/4) - (-3/4) = (-1/4 +3/4)=2/4=1/2. Correct.

Term 8: (-1/2)*0 -0*(1/2)=0. Correct.

Sum: 0 +1/2+3/2+3/2+2+1+1/2+0. Let's convert all to halves:

0 +1/2 +3/2 +3/2 +4/2 +2/2 +1/2 +0 = (0 +1 +3 +3 +4 +2 +1)/2 =14/2=7. Yes, that's correct. So area is 7/2. Hmm. But let me check with another method to confirm.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the area by dividing the octagon into simpler shapes. Since it's a convex polygon, perhaps it can be divided into rectangles and triangles. Let me try.

Looking at the coordinates, the octagon seems to have symmetry. If I look at the coordinates, from (0,0) to (1,0) to (3/2,1/2) to (3/2,3/2) to (1,2) to (0,2) to (-1/2,3/2) to (-1/2,1/2) to (0,0). So it's symmetric about the line x=0.5? Wait, maybe not. Wait, the coordinates go from (0,0) to (1,0), then up to (3/2,1/2), which is beyond x=1. Then up to (3/2,3/2), then to (1,2), then to (0,2), then to (-1/2,3/2), then down to (-1/2,1/2), then back to (0,0). 

Alternatively, maybe it's symmetric about the vertical line x=0.5? Let's check. For example, the point (3/2,1/2) is at x=1.5, and the point (-1/2,1/2) is at x=-0.5. The midpoint between 1.5 and -0.5 is (1.5 + (-0.5))/2 = 1.0/2 = 0.5. Similarly, y-coordinates at those x's are the same. So yes, it's symmetric about the line x=0.5. Similarly, points (3/2,3/2) and (-1/2,3/2) are symmetric. So maybe the octagon is symmetric across x=0.5.

Similarly, if we look at the vertical line x=0.5, the coordinates on either side are mirrored. So maybe we can compute the area of one half and double it. Let's try that.

Looking at the right half (x ≥ 0.5). The vertices are:

(1, 0), (3/2, 1/2), (3/2, 3/2), (1, 2), (0, 2) is not in the right half. Wait, no. Wait, (0, 2) is on the left. So maybe the right half includes (1,0), (3/2,1/2), (3/2,3/2), (1,2). Wait, but (1,2) is at x=1, which is less than 0.5? Wait, x=1 is greater than 0.5. Wait, 0.5 is the midpoint, so x=1 is on the right side. So the right half would have vertices:

(1,0), (3/2,1/2), (3/2,3/2), (1,2). Then the left half is symmetric.

But actually, when we split along x=0.5, the right half would be from x=0.5 to x=1.5, but in this case, the octagon's vertices are at x= -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, etc. Wait, maybe splitting it into left and right halves isn't straightforward. Alternatively, maybe it's better to stick with the shoelace formula result. But 7/2 seems a bit high. Let me check again.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the shoelace terms. Let me recalculate each term step by step.

Term 1: (0,0) to (1,0). The shoelace term is x1 y2 - x2 y1 = 0*0 -1*0 = 0. Correct.

Term 2: (1,0) to (3/2,1/2). Term is 1*(1/2) - (3/2)*0 = 1/2. Correct.

Term 3: (3/2,1/2) to (3/2,3/2). Term is (3/2)*(3/2) - (3/2)*(1/2) = 9/4 - 3/4 = 6/4 = 3/2. Correct.

Term 4: (3/2,3/2) to (1,2). Term is (3/2)*2 -1*(3/2) = 3 - 3/2 = 3/2. Correct.

Term 5: (1,2) to (0,2). Term is 1*2 -0*2 = 2. Correct.

Term 6: (0,2) to (-1/2,3/2). Term is 0*(3/2) - (-1/2)*2 = 0 +1 =1. Correct.

Term 7: (-1/2,3/2) to (-1/2,1/2). Term is (-1/2)*(1/2) - (-1/2)*(3/2) = (-1/4) - (-3/4) = (-1/4 +3/4)= 1/2. Correct.

Term 8: (-1/2,1/2) to (0,0). Term is (-1/2)*0 -0*(1/2)=0. Correct.

So the terms are indeed 0, 1/2, 3/2, 3/2, 2, 1, 1/2, 0. Summing these:

1/2 + 3/2 = 2

2 + 3/2 = 3.5

3.5 + 2 = 5.5

5.5 +1 =6.5

6.5 +0.5=7

Total sum 7, area 7/2. Hmm. So unless there's a mistake in the coordinate calculation, that's the answer. Let me check the coordinates again.

Starting at (0,0):

1. Move right 1 unit: (1,0). Correct.

2. Turn 45 degrees up, move √2/2. Components are (√2/2 * cos45, √2/2 * sin45) = (√2/2 * √2/2, √2/2 * √2/2) = (1/2,1/2). So new position (1 +1/2, 0 +1/2) = (3/2,1/2). Correct.

3. Turn another 45 degrees (total 90 from x-axis), move 1 unit. So direction is 90 degrees, which is straight up. So displacement (0,1). New position (3/2,1/2 +1) = (3/2,3/2). Correct.

4. Turn another 45 degrees (total 135 from x-axis), move √2/2. Direction 135 degrees, displacement (-1/2,1/2). New position (3/2 -1/2, 3/2 +1/2) = (1,2). Correct.

5. Turn another 45 degrees (total 180 from x-axis), move 1 unit. Displacement (-1,0). New position (1 -1, 2 +0) = (0,2). Correct.

6. Turn another 45 degrees (total 225 from x-axis), move √2/2. Displacement (-1/2,-1/2). New position (0 -1/2, 2 -1/2) = (-1/2,3/2). Correct.

7. Turn another 45 degrees (total 270 from x-axis), move 1 unit. Displacement (0,-1). New position (-1/2,3/2 -1) = (-1/2,1/2). Correct.

8. Turn another 45 degrees (total 315 from x-axis), move √2/2. Displacement (1/2,-1/2). New position (-1/2 +1/2,1/2 -1/2) = (0,0). Correct.

So all coordinates are correct. Therefore, the shoelace formula gives area 7/2. But let me check with another approach to verify.

Alternatively, perhaps I can divide the octagon into simpler components. Looking at the coordinates, the octagon can be divided into a rectangle in the center and four rectangles and triangles on the sides.

Wait, looking at the coordinates:

From (1,0) to (3/2,1/2) to (3/2,3/2) to (1,2) to (0,2) to (-1/2,3/2) to (-1/2,1/2) to (0,0). Hmm. Maybe the octagon can be split into a central rectangle and four trapezoids around it.

Alternatively, since the octagon is symmetric about x=0.5, maybe we can compute the area of one half and double it. Let me try that.

Right half (x ≥0.5) includes the points:

(1,0), (3/2,1/2), (3/2,3/2), (1,2), (0,2). Wait, but (0,2) is at x=0, which is not in the right half. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the right half is from x=0.5 to x=1.5, but the points are at x=1,1.5,1, etc. Wait, maybe it's better to split the octagon vertically at x=0.5 and compute the area on each side.

Alternatively, perhaps use coordinate geometry to compute the area. Since the shoelace formula already gives 7/2, and my step-by-step calculation seems correct, maybe 7/2 is the right answer. But just to be thorough, let me check with another method.

Another way to compute the area of a polygon with coordinates is to use the formula:

Area = 1/2 |sum_{i=1 to n} (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i)|

Which is exactly what I did. So unless there's a miscalculation in the coordinates, 7/2 is correct. But let me confirm once more.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the area by breaking the octagon into triangles. For example, connect the center to all vertices, creating eight triangles, each with a central angle of 45 degrees. However, since the sides are not all equal, the triangles won't all be congruent. So that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe compute the area as the sum of trapezoids between consecutive sides.

Alternatively, since the octagon is equiangular, perhaps there's a formula for the area in terms of side lengths and angles. But I don't recall a direct formula for equiangular octagons with alternating sides. The shoelace formula seems the most straightforward here.

Alternatively, let me check with vector cross products. Each term x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i is equivalent to the cross product of the vectors from the origin to (x_i, y_i) and (x_{i+1}, y_{i+1} ). Summing these gives twice the area. But since we already did the shoelace formula correctly, maybe 7/2 is indeed correct.

But let me check with another approach. Let's compute the area by dividing the octagon into simpler shapes. For instance, the octagon can be seen as a central rectangle plus four rectangles on the sides and four triangles on the top and bottom.

Looking at the coordinates, the octagon extends from x=-0.5 to x=1.5 and from y=0 to y=2. Wait, but the vertical extent is from y=0 to y=2, but the horizontal extent is from x=-0.5 to x=1.5. So maybe the bounding rectangle is 2 units wide (from -0.5 to 1.5) and 2 units tall (from 0 to 2). But the area of this bounding rectangle would be 2*2=4, but the octagon is inside it. So 7/2 is 3.5, which is larger than 4. Wait, that can't be. Wait, 7/2 is 3.5, which is less than 4. So maybe that's possible.

Wait, but the bounding rectangle is from x=-0.5 to x=1.5, which is 2 units, and y=0 to y=2, which is 2 units. So area 4. The octagon is inside, but according to the shoelace formula, the area is 3.5, which is 7/2. So that's possible. Let's confirm by visualizing.

Looking at the vertices, the octagon has points at (1,0), (3/2,1/2), (3/2,3/2), (1,2), (0,2), (-1/2,3/2), (-1/2,1/2), (0,0). So the topmost point is at y=2, the bottommost at y=0. The leftmost at x=-0.5, rightmost at x=1.5. So from x=-0.5 to x=1.5, and y=0 to y=2. So the bounding rectangle is 2x2. But the octagon is not filling the entire rectangle. The area is 3.5, which is 7/2. So that's 7/2. Let me check another way.

Alternatively, maybe compute the area as the sum of the areas of the trapezoids between consecutive sides. For example, between each pair of consecutive vertices, compute the area of the trapezoid formed by those two sides and the x-axis. But that might not capture the entire area. Alternatively, use the trapezoid formula for each pair of consecutive edges.

Alternatively, since the polygon is convex, the area can be computed by dividing it into triangles from a common vertex. For example, pick a vertex and draw lines to all other vertices, creating triangles. However, since the octagon is not regular, the triangles will have different areas.

Alternatively, use the coordinates to compute the area with another method. For example, using the surveyor's formula (same as shoelace), which I already did. So unless there's a miscalculation, 7/2 is the answer.

Alternatively, maybe check with the distances between vertices. For example, the distance from (1,0) to (3/2,1/2) is sqrt((1/2)^2 + (1/2)^2) = sqrt(1/4 +1/4)=sqrt(1/2)=√2/2. Correct. Similarly, other sides are length 1 and √2/2 as given. So coordinates are consistent with the side lengths.

Therefore, I think the shoelace formula gives the correct area of 7/2. Therefore, the answer is 7/2.

But wait, 7/2 is 3.5. But in the question, the side lengths are 1 and √2/2. The octagon is not regular, so maybe the area is not an integer. But 7/2 seems a bit odd. Wait, let me check once more.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the direction of the turns. Wait, when moving from one side to the next, the direction of the turn is 45 degrees, but depending on the orientation, it might be left or right turn. But since all turns are 45 degrees, and the octagon is convex, the turns should all be in the same direction (all left turns or all right turns). In my calculation, each turn is 45 degrees to the left, which is consistent with the shoelace formula giving a positive area.

Alternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation in the shoelace terms. Let me recompute the shoelace formula step by step:

List of vertices in order:

1. (0, 0)
2. (1, 0)
3. (3/2, 1/2)
4. (3/2, 3/2)
5. (1, 2)
6. (0, 2)
7. (-1/2, 3/2)
8. (-1/2, 1/2)
9. (0, 0)

Compute each term (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i):

Term 1 (i=1): 0*0 -1*0 =0

Term 2 (i=2):1*(1/2) - (3/2)*0 =1/2

Term 3 (i=3): (3/2)*(3/2) - (3/2)*(1/2)=9/4 -3/4=6/4=3/2

Term 4 (i=4):(3/2)*2 -1*(3/2)=3 -3/2=3/2

Term 5 (i=5):1*2 -0*2=2

Term 6 (i=6):0*(3/2) - (-1/2)*2=0 +1=1

Term 7 (i=7):(-1/2)*(1/2) - (-1/2)*(3/2)= (-1/4) - (-3/4)= (-1/4 +3/4)=1/2

Term 8 (i=8):(-1/2)*0 -0*(1/2)=0

Sum terms:0 +1/2 +3/2 +3/2 +2 +1 +1/2 +0

Convert all to halves:

0 +1/2 +3/2 +3/2 +4/2 +2/2 +1/2 +0 = (0 +1 +3 +3 +4 +2 +1)/2 =14/2=7. So area is 7/2. Correct.

Yes, so after double-checking, the shoelace formula gives 7/2. Therefore, the area of the octagon is 7/2. So the final answer is \boxed{\dfrac{7}{2}}.

**Final Answer**
The area of the octagon is \boxed{\dfrac{7}{2}}.
Therefore, the area of the octagon is $\boxed{\frac{7}{2}}$.
