Okay, let's see. The problem is about a figure skater spinning and determining the final direction she's facing. She starts facing north and spins 2250 degrees to her right. Hmm, right spin would mean she's rotating clockwise, right? Since in figure skating, spinning to the right is clockwise when facing north. So, I need to figure out how many full rotations that is and what the remaining angle is after dividing by 360, which is the number of degrees in a full circle. 

First, maybe I should divide 2250 by 360 to see how many complete spins she does. Let me calculate that. 2250 divided by 360. Let's see, 360 times 6 is 2160. Then 2250 minus 2160 is 90. So that's 6 full spins and 90 degrees. Since each full spin brings her back to the starting direction, the 6 full spins don't change her direction. So the remaining 90 degrees is the key here. 

Now, she started facing north and then spins 90 degrees to her right. Wait, spinning right 90 degrees from north. Let me visualize this. If you're facing north and spin right (which is clockwise), 90 degrees would take you to east. Because north to east is a right turn of 90 degrees. Let me confirm that. North, then a quarter turn clockwise is east. Yes, that's right. So after 2250 degrees, which is 6 full spins plus 90 degrees, she ends up facing east. 

Wait, but let me double-check the math. 360 times 6 is indeed 2160. 2250 minus 2160 is 90. So 90 degrees is correct. Then, starting from north, a 90-degree right turn is east. That seems straightforward. 

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as 2250 divided by 360. Let me do that division again. 360 times 6 is 2160. 2250 - 2160 = 90. So 2250 degrees is equivalent to 6 full circles plus 90 degrees. Since each full circle is 360 degrees, the remainder is 90. So the net rotation is 90 degrees. 

Another way to think about it: 90 degrees is a quarter turn. So if you start facing north and turn right (clockwise) a quarter turn, you end up facing east. So that's consistent. 

Wait, but sometimes when people spin, they might confuse clockwise with counter-clockwise. But in figure skating, spinning to the right (your right) when facing north is indeed clockwise. So a right turn from north is east, then south, then west, then back to north. So 90 degrees right is east. 

Alternatively, if she spun 270 degrees to her right, that would be three-quarters of a turn, ending up facing west. But here it's 90 degrees. 

So, putting it all together, after 6 full spins (which don't affect the direction), the remaining 90 degrees right turn from north leads her to face east. Therefore, the answer should be east. 

I think that's solid. Let me just check if there's any possible mistake. For example, if someone thought that spinning right meant counter-clockwise, but that's not the case in figure skating. So the direction is correct. Also, the division of 2250 by 360: 360*6=2160, 2250-2160=90. Correct. So the remainder is 90. So the direction is 90 degrees right from north, which is east. Therefore, the answer is east.
