Okay, let's see. I need to simplify the expression (-k + 4) + (-2 + 3k). Hmm, simplifying expressions usually involves combining like terms. So first, I should probably remove the parentheses since there's just addition here. That would give me -k + 4 - 2 + 3k. Wait, let me check that. Yeah, when you have a plus sign before the parentheses, you can distribute that to each term inside. So the first term is -k + 4, and then adding the second parentheses which is -2 + 3k. So combining all the terms together, it's -k + 4 - 2 + 3k. 

Now, combining like terms. The terms with k are -k and 3k. Let me add those together. -k + 3k is... that's 2k? Wait, no. Wait, -k is the same as -1k, so -1k + 3k is 2k. Right. Then the constant terms are 4 and -2. So 4 - 2 is 2. So putting it all together, the simplified expression is 2k + 2. 

Wait, let me verify again. Starting with (-k + 4) + (-2 + 3k). Combine the k terms: -k + 3k = 2k. Then the constants: 4 - 2 = 2. So yes, 2k + 2. 

Is there any possibility I missed a sign or a term? Let me check again. Original expression: (-k + 4) + (-2 + 3k). So first term is -k, second term is +4, third term is -2, fourth term is +3k. Combining the k terms: -k + 3k = 2k. Constants: 4 - 2 = 2. So total is 2k + 2. 

I don't think I made a mistake here. It seems straightforward. Maybe another way to check is to substitute a value for k and see if both original and simplified expressions give the same result. Let's pick k=1. Original: (-1 + 4) + (-2 + 3*1) = (3) + (1) = 4. Simplified: 2*1 + 2 = 4. Same result. Let's try k=0. Original: (0 + 4) + (-2 + 0) = 4 -2 = 2. Simplified: 0 + 2 = 2. Correct. How about k=2? Original: (-2 +4) + (-2 +6) = 2 +4 =6. Simplified: 4 +2=6. Yep. Seems to check out. 

So I think that's the correct simplification. 2k + 2.
