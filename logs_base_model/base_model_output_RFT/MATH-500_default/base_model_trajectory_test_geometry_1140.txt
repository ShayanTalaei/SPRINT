Okay, so I need to find the area of triangle ACD in triangle ABC where AB is 17, AC is 8, and BC is 15. D is the foot of the altitude from C to AB. Hmm, let me start by visualizing the triangle. Let me sketch it out mentally. Triangle ABC with AB as the base, which is 17 units long. AC is 8 units, and BC is 15 units. Then, from point C, we drop an altitude to AB, and the foot of that altitude is point D. The area of triangle ACD is what we're after.

First, maybe I should figure out the coordinates of the points to make it easier. Let's place point A at (0, 0) and point B at (17, 0). Then point C will be somewhere in the plane. Since AC is 8 and BC is 15, I can use the distance formula to find the coordinates of C. Let me denote point C as (x, y). Then the distance from A to C is sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = 8, and the distance from B to C is sqrt((x - 17)^2 + y^2) = 15. So, squaring both equations:

1. x² + y² = 64
2. (x - 17)² + y² = 225

Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2: (x - 17)² + y² - x² - y² = 225 - 64 => x² - 34x + 289 + y² - x² - y² = 161 => -34x + 289 = 161 => -34x = 161 - 289 = -128 => x = (-128)/(-34) = 128/34 = 64/17 ≈ 3.7647

So x is 64/17. Then plug back into equation 1: x² + y² = 64 => (64/17)² + y² = 64 => (4096/289) + y² = 64 => y² = 64 - 4096/289. Let me compute that. 64 is 64*289/289 = 18496/289. So y² = (18496 - 4096)/289 = 14400/289. Therefore, y = sqrt(14400/289) = 120/17 ≈ 7.0588. So point C is at (64/17, 120/17).

Now, point D is the foot of the altitude from C to AB. Since AB is on the x-axis from (0,0) to (17,0), the foot D will have the same x-coordinate as the projection of C onto AB. Wait, but AB is horizontal, so the altitude from C to AB is vertical? Wait, no. Wait, AB is on the x-axis, so the altitude from C to AB would be a vertical line if AB is horizontal? Wait, no. If AB is on the x-axis, then the altitude from C to AB is vertical only if AB is horizontal and the altitude is perpendicular to AB. Wait, AB is horizontal, so the altitude from C to AB is vertical? Wait, no. Wait, the altitude from C to AB is perpendicular to AB. Since AB is horizontal, its slope is 0, so the altitude from C is vertical. Wait, that would mean that the x-coordinate of D is equal to the x-coordinate of C. But that can't be right because if you drop a vertical line from C to AB, then yes, the x-coordinate remains the same. Wait, but in that case, the foot D would be (64/17, 0). Let me check that.

But if AB is from (0,0) to (17,0), then the line AB is y=0. The altitude from C to AB is the perpendicular line from C to AB. Since AB is horizontal, the slope of AB is 0, so the slope of the altitude is undefined (i.e., vertical). Therefore, the altitude from C is a vertical line passing through C, which has equation x = 64/17. Therefore, the foot D is indeed (64/17, 0). So point D is (64/17, 0). Therefore, triangle ACD is the triangle with vertices at A(0,0), C(64/17, 120/17), and D(64/17, 0). So the area of triangle ACD can be calculated using the coordinates.

Alternatively, since ACD is a triangle with base AD and height the y-coordinate of C, but wait, no. Wait, ACD has vertices at A, C, D. Wait, but A is (0,0), D is (64/17, 0), and C is (64/17, 120/17). So triangle ACD is a right triangle with right angle at D. The base is AD, which is from (0,0) to (64/17, 0), so length 64/17. The height is the vertical distance from C to D, which is 120/17. Therefore, the area is (base * height)/2 = (64/17 * 120/17)/2 = (64*120)/(17²*2) = (7680)/(289*2) = 7680/578. Let me simplify that. 7680 divided by 578. Let's see, 578*13 = 7514, 578*13.5 = 7514 + 289 = 7803. So 7680 is between 13 and 13.5. Let me compute 578*13 = 7514, subtract that from 7680: 7680 - 7514 = 166. Then 166/578 = 83/289. So the area is 13 + 83/289 = 13.287... But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, actually, 64*120 = 7680, divided by (17²*2) = 289*2=578. So 7680/578. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 2: 3840/289. 289*13 = 3757, 3840 - 3757 = 83. So 3840/289 = 13 + 83/289. So area is 13 83/289. But that seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way to compute this.

Alternatively, since triangle ACD has coordinates A(0,0), C(64/17, 120/17), D(64/17, 0). The area can be calculated using the formula for the area of a triangle given coordinates. The formula is |(x_A(y_C - y_D) + x_C(y_D - y_A) + x_D(y_A - y_C))/2|. Plugging in the coordinates: x_A=0, y_A=0; x_C=64/17, y_C=120/17; x_D=64/17, y_D=0. So:

Area = |0*(120/17 - 0) + (64/17)*(0 - 0) + (64/17)*(0 - 120/17)| / 2
= |0 + 0 + (64/17)*(-120/17)| / 2
= | -7680/289 | / 2
= 7680/289 / 2
= 3840/289
Which is the same as before. So 3840 divided by 289. Let me check if 289 divides into 3840. 289*13 = 3757, 3840 - 3757 = 83. So 3840/289 = 13 + 83/289. So the area is 13 83/289. But this seems like a fractional answer, which is possible, but maybe there's a simpler way or perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let me check the coordinates again. Point C is at (64/17, 120/17). The foot D is at (64/17, 0). Then triangle ACD has vertices at (0,0), (64/17, 120/17), and (64/17, 0). So actually, it's a right triangle with legs of length 64/17 and 120/17. Therefore, area is (64/17 * 120/17)/2 = (7680)/(289*2) = 3840/289. So that's correct. So 3840 divided by 289. Let me see if 289 divides into 3840. 289*13 = 3757, as before. 3840 - 3757 = 83. So 3840/289 = 13 + 83/289. So the area is 13 83/289. But maybe we can write it as an improper fraction or decimal. But the question says "Find the area of triangle ACD." It doesn't specify the form, but in Olympiad problems, fractional forms are preferred unless decimal is specified. So 3840/289 is the exact value. Let me check if this can be simplified. 3840 and 289. 289 is 17². 3840 divided by 17: 3840 ÷17. 17*225=3825, 3840-3825=15, so 3840=17*225 +15, so not divisible by 17. Therefore, 3840/289 is in simplest terms. So the area is 3840/289, which is approximately 13.287. But maybe I can check this another way.

Alternatively, perhaps using the area of triangle ABC and then finding the ratio of areas. Let's see. The area of triangle ABC can be found using Heron's formula. The sides are 17, 15, 8. The semi-perimeter s = (17 +15 +8)/2 = (40)/2 = 20. Then area = sqrt(s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)) = sqrt(20*3*5*12) = sqrt(20*3*5*12). Let's compute that: 20*3=60, 5*12=60, so 60*60=3600. sqrt(3600)=60. So area of ABC is 60. Then, the area of ACD can be found by the ratio of AD to AB. Since D is the foot of the altitude, the area of ACD is (AD / AB) * area of ABC. Wait, is that correct? Wait, no. Wait, the area of ACD is proportional to AD/AB times the height from C. Wait, maybe not exactly. Let me think.

Alternatively, since the area of ABC is 60, and the altitude from C to AB is h. Then area of ABC is (AB * h)/2 = 60. AB is 17, so h = (60*2)/17 = 120/17. Which matches the y-coordinate of point C, which is 120/17. So the altitude h is 120/17. Then, the area of ACD is (AD * h)/2. But AD is the length from A to D. Since D is the foot of the altitude, we can find AD using the coordinates. Since D is at (64/17, 0), then AD is 64/17. Therefore, area of ACD is (64/17 * 120/17)/2 = (7680)/(289*2) = 3840/289, which is the same as before. So that confirms the area is 3840/289. So maybe that's the answer. But let me check again.

Alternatively, maybe using coordinates to compute the area. The coordinates of A(0,0), C(64/17, 120/17), D(64/17, 0). Using the shoelace formula:

Area = 1/2 | (0*120/17 + 64/17*0 + 64/17*0) - (0*64/17 + 120/17*64/17 + 0*0) |
= 1/2 | 0 - (0 + 7680/289 + 0) |
= 1/2 | -7680/289 |
= 1/2 * 7680/289
= 3840/289

Same result. So that's consistent. Therefore, the area of triangle ACD is 3840/289. Let me check if there's a simpler way or if I can verify this another way.

Alternatively, since ABC has area 60, and ACD is a part of it. The ratio of AD to AB is (64/17)/17 = 64/289. Therefore, the area of ACD would be (64/289)*60 = 3840/289. Which matches. So this seems correct.

Alternatively, using vectors. Let me place point A at origin, vector AB is (17,0), vector AC is (64/17, 120/17). The vector AD is the projection of AC onto AB. The projection scalar is (AC · AB)/|AB|². AC · AB = (64/17)*17 + (120/17)*0 = 64. |AB|² = 17² = 289. Therefore, the projection scalar is 64/289. Therefore, the length of AD is 64/289 * |AB| = 64/289 *17 = 64/17, which matches. Then the area of ACD is (AD * height)/2 = (64/17 * 120/17)/2 = 3840/289. So same answer again.

Therefore, I think 3840/289 is the correct answer. Let me check if 3840 divided by 289 is reducible. As before, 289 is 17². 3840 divided by 17 is 225.882..., which is not an integer. So 3840/289 is in simplest terms. So the area is 3840/289, which is approximately 13.287. But since the question asks for the area, and it's a math competition problem, likely the answer is expected in fractional form. So 3840/289.

But let me check once more. Maybe there's a different approach. For example, using coordinates isn't the only way. Maybe using the formula for the area of a triangle given two sides and the included angle. But in this case, we don't know the angle. Alternatively, using the area formula with base and height. But since we have the altitude, which is 120/17, and the base AD is 64/17, so area is (base * height)/2. So that's 64/17 * 120/17 /2 = 3840/289. So same result.

Alternatively, maybe using coordinate geometry by finding the area of ABC and subtracting the area of BCD. But that seems more complicated. Let's see. Area of ABC is 60. If we can find the area of BCD, then subtract it from ABC to get ACD. But BCD is a triangle with vertices at B(17,0), C(64/17, 120/17), D(64/17, 0). So the area of BCD can be calculated similarly. The base BD is 17 - 64/17 = (289 -64)/17 = 225/17. The height is the same altitude from C, which is 120/17. So area of BCD is (225/17 * 120/17)/2 = (27000)/(289*2) = 13500/289. Then area of ACD would be 60 - 13500/289. Let's compute that: 60 is 17340/289. So 17340/289 -13500/289 = 3840/289. Which matches. So that's another way to confirm. So subtracting the area of BCD from ABC gives the area of ACD as 3840/289.

Therefore, after multiple methods and checks, the area of triangle ACD is 3840/289. So the final answer is \boxed{\dfrac{3840}{289}}.

**Final Answer**
The area of triangle \(ACD\) is \boxed{\dfrac{3840}{289}}.
Therefore, the area of triangle $ACD$ is $\boxed{\frac{3840}{289}}$.
