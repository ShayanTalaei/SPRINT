Okay, let me try to figure out how to find the value of \( b \) for the direction vector of the given line. The problem states that the direction vector is of the form \( \begin{pmatrix} -7 \\ b \end{pmatrix} \), and we need to find \( b \).

First, I need to understand the setup. There's an Asymptote code provided that draws a coordinate system with grid lines. Points A and B are given at coordinates (-5,4) and (-1,3) respectively. The line segment LR is drawn in red, which is the intersection of the line AB with the vertical lines at \( x = -8 \) and \( x = 8 \). The goal is to determine the direction vector of this line, specifically the y-component \( b \), given that the x-component is -7.

So, the line passes through points A and B. Let me recall that the direction vector of a line can be found by subtracting the coordinates of two points on the line. That is, if we have two points \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \), the direction vector is \( \begin{pmatrix} x_2 - x_1 \\ y_2 - y_1 \end{pmatrix} \).

Given points A(-5,4) and B(-1,3), the direction vector from A to B would be \( \begin{pmatrix} -1 - (-5) \\ 3 - 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \). However, the problem states that the direction vector is \( \begin{pmatrix} -7 \\ b \end{pmatrix} \). Hmm, so the direction vector given here is a scalar multiple of the direction vector we just found.

Since direction vectors can be scaled by any non-zero scalar, the direction vector \( \begin{pmatrix} -7 \\ b \end{pmatrix} \) must be a scalar multiple of \( \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \). Let's denote the scalar multiple by \( k \), so:

\( \begin{pmatrix} -7 \\ b \end{pmatrix} = k \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \)

This gives us two equations:

1. \( -7 = 4k \)
2. \( b = -k \)

From the first equation, solving for \( k \):

\( k = \frac{-7}{4} \)

Then, substituting into the second equation:

\( b = -(-\frac{7}{4}) = \frac{7}{4} \)

Wait, but let me check this again. If the direction vector is scaled by \( k \), then each component is multiplied by \( k \). So, if the original direction vector is \( \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \), then multiplying by \( k = -7/4 \) gives:

\( 4k = 4 \times (-7/4) = -7 \) (which matches the first component)

\( -1 \times k = -1 \times (-7/4) = 7/4 \) (so \( b = 7/4 \))

That seems correct. So, \( b = \frac{7}{4} \).

But wait, just to make sure, maybe I should verify by checking if the line LR with direction vector \( \begin{pmatrix} -7 \\ 7/4 \end{pmatrix} \) passes through points A and B.

Alternatively, maybe another approach is to find the equation of the line AB and then see its direction vector.

Given points A(-5,4) and B(-1,3), the slope \( m \) of the line AB is:

\( m = \frac{3 - 4}{-1 - (-5)} = \frac{-1}{4} = -\frac{1}{4} \)

So the slope is -1/4. Therefore, the direction vector can be written as \( \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \) since slope is rise over run, which is \( \frac{-1}{4} \), so run is 4, rise is -1.

But the given direction vector is \( \begin{pmatrix} -7 \\ b \end{pmatrix} \). These vectors should be scalar multiples. So, scalar multiple \( k \) such that:

\( -7 = 4k \) and \( b = -1k \)

From the first equation, \( k = -7/4 \), then \( b = -(-7/4) = 7/4 \). So same result.

Alternatively, maybe check if the line passes through points L and R as given in the Asymptote code. The Asymptote code defines L as the intersection of line AB with the vertical line at \( x = -8 \), and R as the intersection with \( x = 8 \). If we can find the coordinates of L and R, we can compute the direction vector from L to R and confirm the value of \( b \).

Let me try that approach.

First, find the equation of line AB. Using points A(-5,4) and B(-1,3).

Slope \( m = (3 - 4)/(-1 - (-5)) = (-1)/(4) = -1/4 \)

So equation in point-slope form: \( y - 4 = -1/4 (x + 5) \)

Simplify:

\( y = -1/4 x - 5/4 + 4 \)

Convert 4 to 16/4:

\( y = -1/4 x - 5/4 + 16/4 = -1/4 x + 11/4 \)

So the equation is \( y = -1/4 x + 11/4 \)

Now, find point L, which is the intersection with \( x = -8 \).

Plug \( x = -8 \) into the equation:

\( y = -1/4 (-8) + 11/4 = 2 + 11/4 = 8/4 + 11/4 = 19/4 \)

So point L is (-8, 19/4)

Similarly, point R is the intersection with \( x = 8 \):

\( y = -1/4 (8) + 11/4 = -2 + 11/4 = (-8/4 + 11/4) = 3/4 \)

So point R is (8, 3/4)

Therefore, the coordinates of L and R are (-8, 19/4) and (8, 3/4). The direction vector from L to R is:

\( \begin{pmatrix} 8 - (-8) \\ 3/4 - 19/4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 16 \\ (-16)/4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 16 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} \)

Wait, but this direction vector is \( \begin{pmatrix} 16 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} \), which can be simplified by dividing by 4: \( \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \). So that's the same as the direction vector we had before.

But the problem states that the direction vector is \( \begin{pmatrix} -7 \\ b \end{pmatrix} \). So, this suggests that the direction vector given in the problem is equivalent to \( \begin{pmatrix} -7 \\ b \end{pmatrix} \), which should be a scalar multiple of \( \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \).

But in the Asymptote code, the direction vector from L to R is \( \begin{pmatrix} 16 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} \), which is a scalar multiple of 4 times \( \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \). So, if we want to express this direction vector as \( \begin{pmatrix} -7 \\ b \end{pmatrix} \), we need to find a scalar \( k \) such that:

\( 16 = -7k \) and \( -4 = b k \)

Wait, but 16 is not equal to -7k. Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the direction vector can be scaled by any scalar, but direction vectors are typically considered in their simplest form, but here the problem specifies the form \( \begin{pmatrix} -7 \\ b \end{pmatrix} \), so perhaps we need to express the direction vector as a scalar multiple of the given form.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the direction vector of the line, which can be in any scalar multiple, but the specific form given is \( \begin{pmatrix} -7 \\ b \end{pmatrix} \). So, we need to find \( b \) such that \( \begin{pmatrix} -7 \\ b \end{pmatrix} \) is a scalar multiple of the actual direction vector.

But in our previous calculation, the actual direction vector from L to R is \( \begin{pmatrix} 16 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} \), which simplifies to \( \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \). Therefore, the direction vector can also be written as \( \begin{pmatrix} -4 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \) by multiplying by -1. However, the problem specifies the form \( \begin{pmatrix} -7 \\ b \end{pmatrix} \). So, let's see if \( \begin{pmatrix} -7 \\ b \end{pmatrix} \) is a scalar multiple of \( \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \).

Letâ€™s set up the proportion:

\( \frac{-7}{4} = \frac{b}{-1} \)

Cross-multiplying:

\( -7 \times (-1) = 4 \times b \)

\( 7 = 4b \)

Therefore, \( b = 7/4 \)

Which matches our previous result.

Alternatively, if we take the direction vector as \( \begin{pmatrix} 16 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} \), and we want to express it as \( \begin{pmatrix} -7 \\ b \end{pmatrix} \), we need to find a scalar \( k \) such that:

\( 16 = -7k \)

\( -4 = b k \)

From the first equation:

\( k = 16 / (-7) = -16/7 \)

Then, substituting into the second equation:

\( -4 = b (-16/7) \)

Multiply both sides by -7/16:

\( b = (-4) \times (-7/16) = 28/16 = 7/4 \)

Same result. Therefore, \( b = 7/4 \).

So, regardless of the approach, the value of \( b \) is \( 7/4 \). Therefore, the answer should be \( \boxed{\frac{7}{4}} \).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\frac{7}{4}}
Therefore, the value of \( b \) is \(\boxed{\frac{7}{4}}\).
