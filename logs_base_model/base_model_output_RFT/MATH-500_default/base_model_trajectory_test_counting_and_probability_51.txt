Okay, so I need to figure out the probability that the sum of two numbers chosen by Paul and Jesse from the first six primes is even. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.

First, let's list out the first six prime numbers. Primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. The primes start from 2, which is the only even prime. The first six primes should be 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13. Let me confirm that: yes, 2 is prime, then 3, 5, 7, 11, 13. So that's six primes. Got that.

Paul and Jesse each choose a number at random from these six primes. So each of them has six possible choices, right? So the total number of possible pairs they can choose is 6 (for Paul) multiplied by 6 (for Jesse), which is 36. So there are 36 possible outcomes. That seems straightforward.

Now, the question is about the probability that the sum of their chosen numbers is even. Hmm. Let me recall that the sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are even or both are odd. Because even + even = even, odd + odd = even, and even + odd = odd. So for the sum to be even, either both numbers are even or both are odd.

Looking at the first six primes: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13. How many even primes are there? Well, 2 is the only even prime. All the others (3,5,7,11,13) are odd. So there's one even prime and five odd primes.

Therefore, when Paul and Jesse choose their numbers, the possible scenarios for the sum being even are:

1. Both choose even numbers. But since there's only one even prime (2), both would have to choose 2. So the number of ways this can happen is 1 (Paul chooses 2) multiplied by 1 (Jesse chooses 2) = 1.

2. Both choose odd numbers. There are five odd primes, so the number of ways this can happen is 5 (Paul's choices) multiplied by 5 (Jesse's choices) = 25.

So the total number of favorable outcomes is 1 + 25 = 26.

Therefore, the probability is 26 favorable outcomes divided by 36 total possible outcomes. Simplifying that fraction: 26/36 can be reduced by dividing numerator and denominator by 2, which gives 13/18.

Wait, let me check that again. 26 divided by 36. Both divisible by 2: 13/18. Yes, that's correct. 13 and 18 have no common divisors other than 1, so that's the simplified form. So the probability is 13/18.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me go through the steps again.

First, confirm the primes: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13. Correct. So six primes. Only one even (2), others odd. So when choosing, each has six options. The sum is even if both even or both odd. Since there's only one even prime, the number of ways to pick two evens is 1 (each picks 2). The number of ways to pick two odds is 5*5=25. So total favorable is 26. Total possible is 6*6=36. 26/36 reduces to 13/18. That seems right.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of probability. The probability that Paul picks an even number is 1/6, and then Jesse has to pick an even number as well, which is also 1/6. So the probability both pick even is (1/6)*(1/6)=1/36.

The probability that Paul picks an odd number is 5/6, and then Jesse also picks an odd number, which is 5/6. So the probability both pick odd is (5/6)*(5/6)=25/36.

Adding those together: 1/36 + 25/36 = 26/36 = 13/18. Same result. So that confirms the answer.

Alternatively, maybe using parity. Since the sum is even if both are even or both are odd. Since there's only one even prime, the number of even numbers is 1, so the probability of picking even is 1/6, odd is 5/6. Then, the probability that both are even is (1/6)^2, both odd is (5/6)^2, so total probability is (1/36) + (25/36) = 26/36 = 13/18. Yep, same answer.

Alternatively, maybe someone might think that since there's only one even prime, the chance that both pick even is very low, but in reality, even though there's only one, the combination still counts as one case. So the calculation is correct.

I think that's thorough. So the probability is 13/18. Let me just check once more. If I list all possible pairs, but that would take time, but maybe take a smaller example. Suppose instead of six primes, take two primes: 2 and 3. Then the possible pairs are (2,2), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3). The sums: 4 (even), 5 (odd), 5 (odd), 6 (even). So two evens and two odds. So probability is 2/4 = 1/2. Which is (number of even pairs + number of odd pairs)/total. Here, even pairs: (2,2), odd pairs: (3,3). So 2/4. Which is (1*1 + 1*1)/2*2. So same idea. So in our case, with 6 primes, same logic applies.

Therefore, I think the answer is 13/18. So I'm confident now.
Thus, the probability that the sum of the numbers they choose is even is $\boxed{\frac{13}{18}}$.
