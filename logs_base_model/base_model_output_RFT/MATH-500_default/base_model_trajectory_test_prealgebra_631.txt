Okay, so I need to find the area of the gray piece in this Chinese tangram puzzle. The square ABCD has an area of 16 square inches, which means each side must be 4 inches because area of a square is side squared. So, side length is sqrt(16) = 4 inches.

Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws the square and some lines. The gray piece is a triangle with vertices at (2,0), (4,2), and (4,0). Let me try to visualize this. The square is from (0,0) to (4,4). The gray triangle connects (2,0) to (4,2) to (4,0). So, it's a right triangle? Wait, let's check the coordinates.

Point D is at (0,0), so (4,0) is point C. The gray triangle has points at (2,0), which is the midpoint of DC, then to (4,2), which is somewhere in the middle of the square, and back to (4,0). Hmm. So, the base of the triangle is from (2,0) to (4,0), which is 2 units long. The height would be the vertical distance from (4,0) to (4,2), which is 2 units. Wait, but the triangle is from (2,0) to (4,2) to (4,0). So, it's actually a triangle with vertices at (2,0), (4,2), and (4,0). Let me confirm.

To find the area of a triangle given three vertices, I can use the shoelace formula. The coordinates are (2,0), (4,2), (4,0). Let's apply the formula:

Area = ½ | (x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2)) |

Plugging in the points:

x1 = 2, y1 = 0
x2 = 4, y2 = 2
x3 = 4, y3 = 0

So,

Area = ½ | 2*(2 - 0) + 4*(0 - 0) + 4*(0 - 2) |
= ½ | 2*2 + 4*0 + 4*(-2) |
= ½ | 4 + 0 - 8 |
= ½ | -4 |
= ½ * 4
= 2 square inches.

Wait, but the total area of the square is 16. If the gray piece is 2, then maybe the answer is 2? But let me check again because the figure is a tangram, which usually has multiple pieces, and the gray piece is one of them. Wait, but the Asymptote code fills only that triangle. But maybe I need to verify if the area is indeed 2.

Alternatively, maybe there's another approach. Since the square is divided into parts by the lines drawn. The square ABCD is divided by the diagonal from A(0,4) to C(4,0), which is the line y = -x + 4. Then there are other lines: from (1,1) to (2,0) to (4,2), and from (0,4) to (3,1) to (3,3). The gray piece is the triangle between (2,0), (4,2), and (4,0). Let me see if that triangle is part of the tangram pieces.

In a tangram, the pieces are usually isosceles triangles. The problem statement mentions all triangles are isosceles, and piece "e" is a square. So, maybe the gray piece is an isosceles triangle. Let's check the sides of the triangle.

From (2,0) to (4,2): distance is sqrt((4-2)^2 + (2-0)^2) = sqrt(4 + 4) = sqrt(8) = 2√2.
From (4,2) to (4,0): distance is 2 units.
From (4,0) to (2,0): distance is 2 units.

So, the triangle has two sides of length 2 and one side of length 2√2. Wait, that's not an isosceles triangle because two sides are equal (2 each) and one is different. Wait, isosceles triangle has at least two equal sides. So, yes, this triangle is isosceles with two sides of length 2. Therefore, the two legs from (4,0) to (2,0) and (4,0) to (4,2) are equal, each 2 units. So, the area would be (base * height)/2 = (2 * 2)/2 = 2. So that's 2 square inches. But the total area of the square is 16, so 2 is a small portion. But maybe that's correct.

Wait, but maybe the triangle is not the gray piece. Wait, the Asymptote code says fill((2,0)--(4,2)--(4,0)--cycle,gray(.7)). So that's the gray area. So according to coordinates, the gray triangle has vertices at (2,0), (4,2), (4,0). Using the shoelace formula, we get 2. Alternatively, since it's a right triangle? Wait, no, because the legs are not along the axes. Wait, is it a right triangle?

Looking at the points: (2,0), (4,0), and (4,2). So, the two sides from (4,0) are vertical (up to (4,2)) and horizontal (left to (2,0)). So, the angle at (4,0) is a right angle. Therefore, the triangle is a right triangle with legs of 2 units each. Therefore, area is (2*2)/2 = 2. So that's correct. So the area is 2.

But wait, in the tangram, all triangles are isosceles. The gray piece is a right isosceles triangle, which is a type of isosceles triangle. So that's fine. The square piece "e" is the square in the center. So, the total area is 16, and if the gray piece is 2, then maybe the answer is 2.

But let me check if there's another way to compute it. Maybe by calculating the area of the other pieces and subtracting.

Looking at the Asymptote code, the square is divided into several parts by the lines:

1. The main diagonal from (0,4) to (4,0).
2. A line from (1,1) to (2,0) to (4,2).
3. A line from (0,4) to (3,1) to (3,3).

So, the square is divided into smaller regions. The gray piece is one of them.

Let me try to identify all the pieces. There's a square "e" at the center. Then, there are triangles and other shapes.

Alternatively, since the problem is about a tangram, which is a dissection of a square into several pieces, and in this case, the gray piece is one of them. The problem states that all triangles are isosceles, and piece "e" is a square. So, the gray piece is an isosceles triangle.

From the coordinates, the gray triangle is a right isosceles triangle with legs of length 2. So, area 2. Therefore, the answer is 2. But let me verify once more.

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let's think about the entire figure. The square is divided into several parts. Let's count the areas of the other pieces to see if they add up to 16.

But perhaps the Asymptote code gives a clue. The gray area is a triangle with coordinates (2,0), (4,2), (4,0). Let's compute the area again using vectors or coordinates.

Alternatively, the base is from (2,0) to (4,0), which is 2 units. The height is from (4,0) to (4,2), which is 2 units. So, area is (base * height)/2 = (2*2)/2 = 2. So that's 2 square inches. So, I think that's correct.

But maybe the problem is in the Asymptote code, the coordinates are drawn with some scaling. Wait, the square is drawn from (0,0) to (4,4), so each unit is 1 inch. So, the coordinates are accurate. Therefore, the area is indeed 2.

But let me check the problem statement again. It says "quadrilateral ABCD is a square with area 16 square inches". So, area 16, side 4. Then, the figure represents the pieces of a Chinese tangram in which all the triangles are isosceles and piece "e" is a square. What is the area of the gray piece?

So, since the gray piece is a triangle with area 2, and the square "e" is in the center. Let's see if the square "e" is indeed 2x2. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the label "e" is at (2,1). So, perhaps the square is from (1,1) to (3,3)? Wait, no. Wait, the label "e" is at (2,1). Wait, maybe the square is from (1,1) to (3,3)? Let me check the Asymptote code.

The Asymptote code draws the square from (0,0) to (4,4). Then, draws the diagonal from (0,4) to (4,0), which is the main diagonal. Then, draws from (1,1) to (2,0) to (4,2). Then, draws from (0,4) to (3,1) to (3,3). So, the square "e" is labeled at (2,1), which is the midpoint between (1,1) and (3,1). Wait, maybe the square is from (1,1) to (3,1) to (3,3) to (1,3), making a 2x2 square. Then, area 4. But the label "e" is at (2,1), which is the center of that square. So, if that's the case, then the square "e" has area 4. Then, the gray triangle has area 2. So total area accounted for by "e" and the gray piece is 6. The total area is 16, so there's more pieces.

But the problem is only asking for the gray piece's area, which we calculated as 2. But maybe the answer is 2. But let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the square "e" is smaller. Let's see. The label "e" is at (2,1). If the square is in the center, maybe it's from (1,1) to (3,3)? Wait, but (1,1) to (3,3) is a diagonal. Wait, no. Wait, the square "e" is probably a smaller square inside. Let's see. If the square "e" is at (2,1), maybe it's a 1x1 square? But then area 1. But the problem says all triangles are isosceles, and "e" is a square. So, maybe the square "e" is 2x2, area 4, and the gray triangle is 2, making 6. Then, the remaining area is 10. But maybe the other pieces add up.

Alternatively, maybe the gray piece is not 2. Wait, let me confirm again. The triangle with vertices at (2,0), (4,2), (4,0). Let's plot these points:

- (2,0): midpoint of DC
- (4,2): a point halfway between (4,0) and (4,4), but shifted down by 2 units. Wait, (4,4) is point B, so (4,2) is halfway between B and C. So, (4,2) is the midpoint of BC. Then, (2,0) is the midpoint of DC. So, connecting these points. So, the triangle is formed by connecting midpoints of DC, BC, and C. So, triangle DMC, where D is (0,0), M is midpoint of DC (2,0), C is (4,0), and midpoint of BC is (4,2). Wait, but actually, the triangle is between M(2,0), C(4,0), and midpoint of BC (4,2). So, this triangle is a right triangle with legs of 2 units each, so area 2.

Alternatively, maybe the triangle is not right-angled? Wait, point M is (2,0), C is (4,0), and midpoint of BC is (4,2). So, from (2,0) to (4,2) is a diagonal line. So, the triangle is actually a right triangle at point C(4,0). Because from (4,0) to (4,2) is vertical, and from (4,0) to (2,0) is horizontal. So, the right angle is at (4,0). Therefore, the legs are 2 units each. Therefore, area is 2.

Therefore, I think the area of the gray piece is 2 square inches.

But wait, the problem mentions that all triangles are isosceles. The gray piece is a right triangle, which is a type of isosceles triangle. So that's fine. The square "e" is a square. The other pieces must be triangles or other polygons.

Therefore, after careful consideration, I think the area of the gray piece is 2 square inches.
Therefore, the area of the gray piece is $\boxed{2}$ square inches.
