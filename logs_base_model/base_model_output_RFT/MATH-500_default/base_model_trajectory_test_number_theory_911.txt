Okay, let's see. I need to find the value of n such that the sum 1 + 12 + 123 + 1234 + 12345 + 123456 + 1234567 + 12345678 is congruent to n modulo 9. And n has to be between 0 and 8. Hmm, right. So, modulo 9... I remember that there's a trick with modulo 9 where the remainder when you divide by 9 is the same as the sum of the digits of the number modulo 9. So, maybe I can use that property here. Instead of adding up all those big numbers and then taking modulo 9, I can just add up the sum of the digits of each number and then take modulo 9. That should simplify things a lot because the numbers given are pretty large, and summing them directly would be tedious.

Let me verify if that's correct. For example, take a number like 12. The sum of its digits is 1 + 2 = 3. Then 12 modulo 9 is 3, which is the same. Similarly, 123: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, and 123 modulo 9 is 6. Yeah, that seems to hold. So, this method should work. Therefore, instead of calculating each term modulo 9 and adding them up, I can compute the sum of the digits of each term and then take that total modulo 9. That should give me the same result as the original sum modulo 9. That's a great simplification.

So, the plan is to:

1. For each number in the sum (1, 12, 123, etc.), compute the sum of its digits.
2. Sum all those digit sums together.
3. Take the total sum modulo 9 to find n.

Alright, let's start with each term one by one.

First term: 1. The sum of its digits is 1. Easy.

Second term: 12. Digits are 1 and 2. Sum is 1 + 2 = 3.

Third term: 123. Digits are 1, 2, 3. Sum is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

Fourth term: 1234. Digits are 1, 2, 3, 4. Sum is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.

Fifth term: 12345. Digits are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Sum is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15.

Sixth term: 123456. Digits are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Sum is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21.

Seventh term: 1234567. Digits are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Sum is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28.

Eighth term: 12345678. Digits are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Sum is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 36.

Now, let's list all these digit sums:

1. 1
2. 3
3. 6
4. 10
5. 15
6. 21
7. 28
8. 36

Now, let's add them up. Let me start adding step by step to minimize errors.

First, add the first two: 1 + 3 = 4.

Then add the next one: 4 + 6 = 10.

Next: 10 + 10 = 20.

Then: 20 + 15 = 35.

Next: 35 + 21 = 56.

Then: 56 + 28 = 84.

Finally: 84 + 36 = 120.

So, the total sum of all digit sums is 120. Now, we need to compute 120 modulo 9.

To find 120 modulo 9, one way is to divide 120 by 9 and find the remainder. Let's do that.

9 * 13 = 117. 120 - 117 = 3. So, 120 divided by 9 is 13 with a remainder of 3. Therefore, 120 modulo 9 is 3. Hence, n should be 3.

Wait, but let me check if this is correct. Maybe I made a mistake in adding the digit sums. Let me verify each step again.

First term: 1.

Second: 3. Total so far: 4.

Third: 6. 4 + 6 = 10.

Fourth: 10. 10 + 10 = 20.

Fifth: 15. 20 + 15 = 35.

Sixth: 21. 35 + 21 = 56.

Seventh: 28. 56 + 28 = 84.

Eighth: 36. 84 + 36 = 120. That seems correct.

120 divided by 9: 9*13=117, 120-117=3. So yes, remainder 3. So n=3.

But just to be thorough, maybe I should check another way. For example, instead of summing all digit sums, maybe compute each term modulo 9 first and then sum those. Maybe that would be a good cross-check.

Let's try that. Compute each term modulo 9, then sum them up modulo 9.

First term: 1. 1 mod 9 is 1.

Second term: 12. 12 mod 9: 12 - 9 = 3. So 3.

Third term: 123. Let's compute 123 mod 9. Since 1+2+3=6, 6 mod 9 is 6. So 6.

Fourth term: 1234. Sum of digits 1+2+3+4=10. 10 mod 9 is 1. So 1.

Fifth term: 12345. Sum of digits 1+2+3+4+5=15. 15 mod 9: 15-9=6. So 6.

Sixth term: 123456. Sum of digits 1+2+3+4+5+6=21. 21 mod 9: 21-18=3. So 3.

Seventh term: 1234567. Sum of digits 1+2+3+4+5+6+7=28. 28 mod 9: 28-27=1. So 1.

Eighth term: 12345678. Sum of digits 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8=36. 36 mod 9 is 0. So 0.

Now, the terms modulo 9 are: 1, 3, 6, 1, 6, 3, 1, 0.

Sum these up: 1 + 3 = 4; 4 + 6 = 10; 10 + 1 = 11; 11 + 6 = 17; 17 + 3 = 20; 20 + 1 = 21; 21 + 0 = 21. Then 21 mod 9 is 3. Same result as before. So n=3. So both methods give the same answer. That's reassuring.

Therefore, the answer is 3.

But just to make sure, let me compute the original sum directly modulo 9, just to cross-verify. Although the numbers are big, maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, since each term is being added, and each term is congruent to the sum of its digits mod 9, which we already did. But to check, maybe compute the total sum as numbers, then take modulo 9.

Compute the total sum:

1 + 12 = 13

13 + 123 = 136

136 + 1234 = 1370

1370 + 12345 = 13715

13715 + 123456 = 137171

137171 + 1234567 = 1371738

1371738 + 12345678 = let's compute that.

1371738 + 12345678:

1371738 + 12,345,678 = 13,717,38 + 123,456,78 = 1371738 + 12345678.

Let me add them step by step:

1371738 + 12,345,678.

Break it down:

1371738 + 12,000,000 = 13,137,1738? Wait, maybe better to do it properly.

Wait, 12,345,678 + 1,371,738.

Let me write them aligned:

12,345,678

+ 1,371,738

= ?

Adding the units place: 8 + 8 = 16, write 6, carryover 1.

Tens place: 7 + 3 + 1 = 11, write 1, carryover 1.

Hundreds place: 6 + 7 + 1 = 14, write 4, carryover 1.

Thousands place: 5 + 1 + 1 = 7, write 7, no carryover.

Ten-thousands place: 4 + 3 = 7, write 7.

Hundred-thousands place: 3 + 1 = 4, write 4.

Millions place: 2 + 1 = 3, write 3.

Ten-millions place: 1 + 0 = 1, write 1.

Wait, but the second number is 1,371,738. Let me ensure the alignment:

12,345,678

+ 1,371,738

They have different number of digits. Let's write them as:

12,345,678

+ 01,371,738

= 13,717,416

Wait, let's check:

12,345,678

+ 1,371,738

Starting from the right:

8 + 8 = 16, write 6, carryover 1

7 + 3 + 1 = 11, write 1, carryover 1

6 + 7 + 1 = 14, write 4, carryover 1

5 + 1 + 1 = 7, write 7

4 + 3 = 7, write 7

3 + 1 = 4, write 4

2 + 1 = 3, write 3

1 + 0 = 1, write 1

So the sum is 13,717,416.

Wait, but wait: 12,345,678 + 1,371,738. Let me check with another method.

12,345,678 + 1,000,000 = 13,345,678

13,345,678 + 371,738 = ?

13,345,678 + 300,000 = 13,645,678

13,645,678 + 71,738 = 13,645,678 + 70,000 = 13,715,678; then +1,738 = 13,717,416. Yeah, same result.

So total sum is 13,717,416.

Now, compute 13,717,416 modulo 9.

Again, using the digit sum method: sum of digits = 1 + 3 + 7 + 1 + 7 + 4 + 1 + 6.

Let's compute that:

1 + 3 = 4

4 + 7 = 11

11 + 1 = 12

12 + 7 = 19

19 + 4 = 23

23 + 1 = 24

24 + 6 = 30.

Sum of digits is 30. Then 30 modulo 9: 30 - 27 = 3. So 3. Same answer. So n=3. Therefore, all methods converge to 3. So the answer is 3.

Therefore, the final answer is $\boxed{3}$.
