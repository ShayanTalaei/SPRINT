Okay, let me try to figure out the measure of angle PQR in this diagram. So, first, let me visualize the Asymptote code they provided. There's a base line from (0,0) to (10,0), which is labeled as QR. Then there's another line from (10,0) to (20,0), but that's probably just extending the base. Then there's a quadrilateral connecting (-7,10) to (0,0) to (10,0) to (20,0) and back to (-7,10). Wait, no, the Asymptote code draws from (0,0) to (-7,10) to (7,10) to (10,0), so that's a triangle on top of the base QR. Then another line from (-5,10) to (7,10), which is maybe another line? Hmm, maybe the labels are a bit confusing.

Wait, the labels are P at (-7,10), T at (7,10), R at (10,0), Q at (0,0), and there's an arrow on QR from Q to R. The arrows on the top lines: there's an arrow on the line from (-5,10) to (7,10), so maybe that's PT? Wait, the problem states that PT is parallel to QR. So PT is the top horizontal line at y=10, from (-5,10) to (7,10), and QR is the base from (0,0) to (10,0). So PT is parallel to QR, which are both horizontal lines.

The angles labeled are x degrees at point P, 2x degrees at point T, and 128 degrees at point R. The question is to find the measure of angle PQR. So angle PQR is at point Q, between points P, Q, and R. Wait, but in the Asymptote code, Q is at (0,0), so angle PQR is the angle at Q between PQ and QR. Let me confirm.

Looking at the Asymptote code, the lines are drawn as follows: (0,0) connected to (-7,10) connected to (7,10) connected to (10,0), forming a triangle PQT with base QR. Then another line from (-5,10) to (7,10). The labels are x degrees at (-6,10), which is near point P, labeled 2x degrees at (7,10), which is near point T, and 128 degrees at (10,0), which is point R. So angle at R is 128 degrees. The question is angle PQR, which is at point Q (0,0), between P (which is (-7,10)) and R (10,0). So angle PQR is the angle at Q between lines QP and QR.

Wait, but if PT is parallel to QR, then maybe there are some corresponding angles or alternate interior angles we can use here. Since PT is parallel to QR, and there's a transversal intersecting them. Let me see. The lines from Q to P and from Q to T might be the transversals. Let's consider the lines QP and QT intersecting the parallel lines PT and QR. So, for example, angle at Q between QP and QR (which is angle PQR) and the angle at P between QP and PT (which is x degrees) might be corresponding angles or something else.

Wait, but PT is parallel to QR, and QP is a transversal. So the angle at P (x degrees) and the angle at R (128 degrees) might be related. Wait, angle at R is 128 degrees. Since QR is the base, and PR is connected to R, but maybe triangle PQR? Wait, no, in the diagram, P is connected to Q and T, and T is connected to R. Wait, maybe there's a triangle PQR? Let me check the Asymptote code again. The lines are (0,0) to (-7,10), then to (7,10), then to (10,0). So the figure is a quadrilateral with vertices at Q(0,0), P(-7,10), T(7,10), and R(10,0). Then there's another line from (-5,10) to (7,10). Wait, maybe that's a separate line? But the labels are at (-6,10) for x degrees and (7,10) for 2x degrees. So point P is (-7,10), and point T is (7,10). So the line PT is from (-7,10) to (7,10), which is horizontal, and QR is from (0,0) to (10,0), also horizontal. So PT is parallel to QR.

Now, the angles at P and T are labeled as x and 2x degrees. Those angles are at the top vertices of the quadrilateral, perhaps the angles between the sides and the top line PT. Then, at R, the angle is 128 degrees. The question is angle PQR, which is at Q between PQ and QR.

Hmm, maybe we can use the fact that PT is parallel to QR, and consider the triangle PQR. Wait, but PQR is not a triangle unless we connect P to R directly. Wait, looking at the Asymptote code, the line from Q(0,0) to R(10,0) is the base, and from Q to P(-7,10) and Q to T(7,10). So the figure is a quadrilateral Q-P-T-R-Q. Since PT is parallel to QR, maybe this is a trapezoid. Then, in a trapezoid, consecutive angles between the non-parallel sides are supplementary. Wait, but PT is parallel to QR, and the legs are QP and TR. Wait, maybe not. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the angles at P and T. Since PT is parallel to QR, and QP is a transversal, the angle at P (x degrees) and the angle at R (128 degrees) might be related. Wait, if QP is a transversal cutting PT and QR, then the angle at P (x) and the angle at R (128 degrees) could be consecutive interior angles, which would sum to 180 degrees. Wait, but consecutive interior angles are supplementary, so x + 128 = 180, which would make x = 52 degrees. Then angle at T would be 2x = 104 degrees.

But then, how does that help us find angle PQR? Let's see. If we have angles at P and T, and we know PT is parallel to QR, maybe we can find some relationship with the angles in triangle PQR. Wait, but PQR is a triangle with vertices at P, Q, R. Wait, no, because in the diagram, Q is connected to P and T, but not directly to R. Wait, maybe the triangle is PQR, with Q connected to P and R, but in the Asymptote code, Q is connected to P(-7,10) and to T(7,10), and then T is connected to R(10,0). So the figure is a quadrilateral, not a triangle. So angle PQR is at Q, between PQ and QR. So maybe we can consider triangle PQR, but in this case, QR is a side, and PQ is another side, but PR is the other side. Wait, but in the diagram, PR is not directly drawn. Wait, maybe we need to consider triangle PQR, but we have to find angle at Q. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe considering the angles at Q. Let's see. The lines from Q to P and Q to T create angles at Q. Since PT is parallel to QR, and QP is a transversal, the angle between QP and PT (which is x degrees) and the angle between QR and QP (which is angle PQR) might be related. Wait, but angle PQR is the angle between QP and QR, which is adjacent to the angle at Q in triangle PQR. Wait, maybe using the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.

Wait, but maybe it's better to look at the trapezoid. Since PT is parallel to QR, and the legs are QP and TR. Then, the consecutive angles between the legs and the bases would be supplementary. So, the angle at P (x) and the angle at R (128 degrees) should be supplementary if they are on the same side. Wait, but angle at R is 128 degrees, which is on the base QR. If angle at P is x, then x + 128 = 180, so x = 52 degrees. Then angle at T is 2x = 104 degrees.

But then, in the trapezoid, the angles at T and R would also be supplementary. Wait, angle at T is 104 degrees, and angle at R is 128 degrees. 104 + 128 = 232, which is more than 180, so that can't be. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Because in a trapezoid, consecutive angles between the same leg are supplementary. So, at the leg QP, the angles at P and Q should be supplementary. Wait, but angle at P is x, and angle at Q (which is angle PQR) would be supplementary to x. So x + angle PQR = 180. If angle PQR is the angle at Q between QP and QR, then yes, that would be supplementary to angle at P. So angle PQR = 180 - x.

Similarly, at the other leg TR, the angles at T and R would be supplementary. So angle at T (2x) + angle at R (128) = 180. So 2x + 128 = 180 => 2x = 52 => x = 26 degrees. Wait, that contradicts the previous result where x was 52 degrees. Hmm, so which one is correct?

Wait, maybe I need to clarify which angles are supplementary. In a trapezoid with bases PT and QR, the legs are QP and TR. Then, the angles adjacent to each leg on the same base are supplementary. So, at leg QP, the angles at P and Q are on the same side, so they should be supplementary. Similarly, at leg TR, the angles at T and R should be supplementary.

So, if angle at P is x, then angle PQR (at Q) is 180 - x. If angle at R is 128 degrees, then angle at T (2x) must satisfy 2x + 128 = 180, so 2x = 52, x = 26 degrees. Then angle PQR is 180 - x = 154 degrees. But that seems too large. Wait, but in the diagram, angle at R is 128 degrees, which is a big angle. If angle PQR is 154 degrees, that would make sense as a large angle at Q.

But let me check again. If angle at R is 128 degrees, and it's on the base QR, then in the trapezoid, angle at R and angle at T (on leg TR) are supplementary. So 128 + 2x = 180 => 2x = 52 => x = 26. Then angle at P is x = 26, and angle PQR (at Q) is supplementary to angle at P, so 180 - 26 = 154 degrees. So angle PQR is 154 degrees. But let me confirm if this makes sense with the diagram.

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, the label for 128 degrees is at (10,0), which is point R. The label x degrees is at (-6,10), which is near point P, and 2x degrees at (7,10), near point T. So if angle at R is 128 degrees, then angle at T is 2x = 52 degrees, which is on leg TR. Then angle at P is x = 26 degrees, which is on leg QP. Then angle PQR is supplementary to angle at P, so 180 - 26 = 154 degrees. That seems correct.

But let me check if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using triangle PQR. Wait, but in the diagram, PQR is not a triangle because Q is connected to P and T, and T is connected to R. So the figure is a quadrilateral. Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle involved here. Let's see.

Alternatively, since PT is parallel to QR, and QP is a transversal, then angle between QP and PT (which is x degrees) and angle between QP and QR (which is angle PQR) are supplementary. So x + angle PQR = 180. Therefore, angle PQR = 180 - x.

Also, since PT is parallel to QR, and TR is a transversal, the angle at T (2x degrees) and the angle at R (128 degrees) are supplementary. So 2x + 128 = 180 => 2x = 52 => x = 26. Therefore, angle PQR = 180 - 26 = 154 degrees.

So that seems to be consistent. Therefore, the measure of angle PQR is 154 degrees.

Wait, but let me check if there's another approach. For example, using the fact that the sum of angles in a quadrilateral is 360 degrees. The quadrilateral is Q-P-T-R. The angles at Q, P, T, R are angle PQR (which we need to find), x, 2x, and 128 degrees. So sum is 360. So angle PQR + x + 2x + 128 = 360. Then angle PQR + 3x = 232. If angle PQR is 154, then 154 + 3x = 232 => 3x = 78 => x = 26. Which matches our previous result. So that checks out. So angle PQR is 154 degrees.

Therefore, the answer is 154 degrees.
