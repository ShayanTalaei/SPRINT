Okay, let's see. I need to find the remainder when 54 is divided by 6. Hmm, modular arithmetic. Right, so 54 mod 6. Let me think. The modulus operation gives the remainder after division. So, when you divide 54 by 6, how much is left over?

First, I should recall that dividing by 6 is the same as seeing how many times 6 fits into 54. Let me do the division. 6 times 9 is 54, right? 6*9=54. So if I divide 54 by 6, the quotient is 9 and the remainder is 0. Because 54 minus 6*9 is 0. So the remainder should be 0.

Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes I mix up the remainder. Let me take another approach. Let's break down 54 into multiples of 6. 6*8=48, 6*9=54. So 54 is exactly 6 times 9, so there's no remainder. Therefore, the remainder is 0.

Alternatively, maybe using the division algorithm. The division algorithm states that for any integers a and b (with b>0), there exist unique integers q and r such that a = bq + r, where 0 ≤ r < b. Here, a is 54 and b is 6. So we need to find q and r where 54 = 6q + r and 0 ≤ r < 6. 

If we take q=9, then 6*9=54, so r=0. That satisfies the condition because 0 is less than 6. So r=0 is the remainder. That confirms it again. 

Another way to think about it is that 6 is a factor of 54 because 54 divided by 6 is an integer. Therefore, the remainder must be zero. Since 6*9=54 exactly, there's nothing left over. 

I think that's solid. All methods point to the remainder being 0. Let me just visualize it. If I have 54 objects and I group them into sets of 6, how many groups would I have? 54 divided by 6 is 9 groups with none left over. So yes, remainder 0. 

Alternatively, if I subtract multiples of 6 from 54 until I can't subtract anymore. Let's try that. Start with 54. Subtract 6: 54-6=48. Subtract 6 again: 48-6=42. Continuing this way, subtract 6 nine times: 54-6*9=54-54=0. So after subtracting 6 nine times, we reach 0. That means the remainder is 0. 

Wait, but what if the division isn't exact? For example, if the number wasn't a multiple of 6, say 55. Then 55 divided by 6 is 9 with a remainder of 1, because 6*9=54 and 55-54=1. But in this case, it's 54, which is exactly 6*9. So remainder is 0. 

I think I've checked this from multiple angles: division, division algorithm, subtraction of multiples, and even real-world grouping. All confirm that the remainder is 0. Therefore, I can confidently say the remainder is 0.
Therefore, the remainder when 54 is divided by 6 is \boxed{0}.
