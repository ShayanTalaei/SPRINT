Okay, let's try to figure out how many distinct values exist in the range of the function f(x) = floor[ (-5/8)^x ] for x in [0, ∞). Hmm, the floor function returns the greatest integer less than or equal to the given number. So, I need to analyze how (-5/8)^x behaves as x increases from 0 to infinity and determine the distinct integer values it takes.

First, let me recall that (-5/8) is a negative fraction. When raising a negative number to a real exponent, the result can be complex if the exponent is not an integer. However, since the problem states that f(x) is a real number, maybe there's a restriction on x? Wait, the domain is given as [0, ∞). But for non-integer x, (-5/8)^x might not be real. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, let me check the problem statement again.

The question says the function is defined for all x in [0, ∞) such that f(x) is a real number. So, perhaps the domain is restricted to x where (-5/8)^x is real. Since (-5/8) is negative, raising it to a real power x will only result in a real number if x is an integer. Otherwise, it's complex. Therefore, maybe the function is only defined for integer x? But the problem says x is in [0, ∞). Wait, maybe the problem assumes that even for non-integer x, the result is real? But that's not the case with negative bases. Hmm, this might be a point of confusion.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering only x such that (-5/8)^x is real. So, if x is an integer, then (-5/8)^x is real. If x is a rational number with an even denominator, it might be real if the base is positive, but here it's negative. If x is rational with an odd denominator, then it's real. For irrational exponents, it's not real. So, perhaps the function is defined only for x where x is an integer? But the problem states x ∈ [0, ∞), so maybe the domain is restricted to x where the expression is real. Therefore, the domain is x ∈ [0, ∞) ∩ ℚ, but even that might not make sense. Wait, maybe the problem is considering only integer x? Let me check.

Wait, the problem says "for all values of x in [0, ∞) such that f(x) is a real number." So, it's not necessarily all x in [0, ∞), but only those x for which (-5/8)^x is real. So, perhaps x must be an integer? Because if x is a non-integer rational number, then (-5/8)^x would be complex. For example, (-5/8)^(1/2) is the square root of a negative number, which is complex. Similarly, irrational exponents would also lead to complex numbers. Therefore, the function f(x) is only real when x is an integer. So, the domain is x ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}.

Therefore, the function is defined as f(x) = floor[ (-5/8)^x ] for x = 0, 1, 2, 3, ... and we need to find how many distinct values exist in the range of f(x).

So, first, let me compute (-5/8)^x for x starting from 0 and see how the values behave.

For x = 0: (-5/8)^0 = 1. So, floor(1) = 1.

x = 1: (-5/8)^1 = -5/8 = -0.625. floor(-0.625) = -1.

x = 2: (-5/8)^2 = (25/64) ≈ 0.390625. floor(0.390625) = 0.

x = 3: (-5/8)^3 = (-125/512) ≈ -0.244140625. floor(-0.244140625) = -1.

x = 4: (-5/8)^4 = (625/4096) ≈ 0.152587890625. floor(0.152587890625) = 0.

x = 5: (-5/8)^5 = (-3125/32768) ≈ -0.095367431640625. floor(-0.095367431640625) = -1.

x = 6: (-5/8)^6 = (15625/262144) ≈ 0.060000000000000006. floor(0.06) = 0.

x = 7: (-5/8)^7 = (-78125/2097152) ≈ -0.03725290298461914. floor(-0.03725...) = -1.

x = 8: (-5/8)^8 = (390625/16777216) ≈ 0.023283064365386963. floor(0.023...) = 0.

x = 9: (-5/8)^9 = (-1953125/134217728) ≈ -0.01455191522836683. floor(-0.01455...) = -1.

x = 10: (-5/8)^10 = (9765625/1073741824) ≈ 0.009053411165775454. floor(0.00905...) = 0.

Hmm, so starting from x=2, the values are 0, -1, 0, -1, 0, -1, etc. It seems like after x=2, the values alternate between 0 and -1. Let me check higher x.

x=11: (-5/8)^11 ≈ - (5/8)^11 ≈ - (48828125 / 8589934592) ≈ -0.005688. floor(-0.005688) = -1.

x=12: (-5/8)^12 ≈ (5/8)^12 ≈ 244140625 / 68719476736 ≈ 0.0035527136788000244. floor(0.00355...) = 0.

So, indeed, for even x ≥ 2, the value is positive and decreasing towards 0, but still positive, so floor is 0. For odd x ≥ 3, the value is negative and approaching 0 from below, so floor is -1.

So, the values of f(x) are:

x=0: 1

x=1: -1

x=2: 0

x=3: -1

x=4: 0

x=5: -1

x=6: 0

x=7: -1

x=8: 0

... and so on.

Therefore, the distinct values in the range of f(x) are 1, -1, and 0.

Wait, but let me check x=0 and x=1: x=0 gives 1, x=1 gives -1, x=2 gives 0, and then all higher x from 3 onwards alternate between -1 and 0. Therefore, the possible outputs are 1, -1, and 0. So, three distinct values.

But let me confirm for x=0: (-5/8)^0 is 1, so floor(1) is 1. Correct.

x=1: (-5/8)^1 is -5/8 = -0.625, floor of that is -1.

x=2: (25/64) ≈ 0.390625, floor is 0.

x=3: (-125/512) ≈ -0.244, floor is -1.

x=4: (625/4096) ≈ 0.15258789, floor is 0.

x=5: (-3125/32768) ≈ -0.0953674316, floor is -1.

x=6: (15625/262144) ≈ 0.060000000000000006, floor is 0.

x=7: (-78125/2097152) ≈ -0.03725290298461914, floor is -1.

x=8: (390625/16777216) ≈ 0.023283064365386963, floor is 0.

x=9: (-1953125/134217728) ≈ -0.01455191522836683, floor is -1.

x=10: (9765625/1073741824) ≈ 0.009053411165775454, floor is 0.

Yes, so it's clear that after x=2, even exponents give positive values that are getting smaller, approaching 0 from above, so their floor is 0. Odd exponents starting from x=3 give negative values approaching 0 from below, so their floor is -1. So, the outputs are 1, -1, and 0. Therefore, three distinct values.

But wait, let me check if there's any x where floor[ (-5/8)^x ] could be another integer. For example, could (-5/8)^x be greater than 1? For x=0, it's 1. For x negative? Wait, but the domain is x in [0, ∞). So, x can't be negative. So, (-5/8)^x is always positive for even x and negative for odd x, but in absolute value, it's decreasing as x increases. So, the maximum value is 1 when x=0, and it's positive but less than 1 for x=2,4,6,... and negative but greater than -1 for x=1,3,5,...

Therefore, the floor of (-5/8)^x can only be 1, 0, or -1. There's no x in the domain where (-5/8)^x is between 1 and 2, so floor would be 1. The next integer is 0, which occurs when (-5/8)^x is between 0 and 1. And the next integer is -1, which occurs when (-5/8)^x is between -1 and 0. Since for x ≥1, (-5/8)^x is always between -1 and 0 (for odd x) or between 0 and 1 (for even x). Wait, x=0 is 1. For x=1, it's -5/8 ≈ -0.625, which is between -1 and 0. For x=2, it's 25/64 ≈ 0.390625, between 0 and 1. For x=3, -125/512 ≈ -0.244, between -1 and 0. So, indeed, all values are between -1 and 1, but not including 1 except at x=0, and not including -1 except at x=1. So, the floor can only be -1, 0, or 1. Therefore, the range of f(x) is {-1, 0, 1}, so three distinct values.

But wait, hold on. Let me check for x=0: floor(1) = 1. For x=1: floor(-0.625) = -1. For x=2: floor(0.390625) = 0. For x=3: floor(-0.244) = -1. For x=4: floor(0.15258789) = 0. For x=5: floor(-0.0953674316) = -1. For x=6: floor(0.06) = 0. For x=7: floor(-0.03725290298461914) = -1. For x=8: floor(0.023283064365386963) = 0. For x=9: floor(-0.01455191522836683) = -1. For x=10: floor(0.009053411165775454) = 0. So, yes, the outputs are only 1, -1, 0. Therefore, the range has three distinct values. So, the answer is 3.

But let me confirm if there's any x beyond x=10 where floor[ (-5/8)^x ] could be something else. For example, if x is such that (-5/8)^x is exactly -1, but (-5/8)^x = -1 would require that (-5/8)^x = -1. But since (-5/8) is a negative number, raising it to an integer power x would give -1 only if (-5/8)^x = -1. But (-5/8)^x = -1 implies that (5/8)^x = 1, which only happens when x=0, but x=0 gives 1, not -1. So, there's no x where (-5/8)^x = -1. Similarly, (-5/8)^x = 1 only when x=0, which gives 1. So, the only integers in the range are -1, 0, 1. Therefore, three distinct values.

Hence, the number of distinct values in the range of f(x) is 3.
However, let me verify once again. For x=0, (-5/8)^0 = 1, floor is 1. For x=1, (-5/8)^1 = -5/8, which is -0.625, floor is -1. For x=2, (25/64) ≈0.390625, floor 0. For x=3, (-125/512) ≈-0.244, floor -1. For x=4, (625/4096) ≈0.15258789, floor 0. For x=5, (-3125/32768) ≈-0.0953674316, floor -1. For x=6, (15625/262144) ≈0.06, floor 0. For x=7, (-78125/2097152) ≈-0.03725290298461914, floor -1. For x=8, (390625/16777216) ≈0.023283064365386963, floor 0. For x=9, (-1953125/134217728) ≈-0.01455191522836683, floor -1. For x=10, (9765625/1073741824) ≈0.009053411165775454, floor 0. It's clear that after x=2, even exponents give positive numbers approaching 0, so floor is 0. Odd exponents give negative numbers approaching 0, so floor is -1. Therefore, the outputs are 1, -1, 0. No other integers are possible. Therefore, three distinct values. So, the answer should be 3.
