Okay, so I need to compute A²⁷ + A³¹ + A⁴⁰ where A is the given 2x2 matrix. Hmm, that seems like a lot of matrix exponentiation. Let me think about how to approach this. 

First, maybe I should check if A has any special properties, like being diagonalizable or having a pattern that could simplify exponentiation. If A can be diagonalized, then raising it to a power becomes easier because diagonal matrices are straightforward to exponentiate. Alternatively, if A is idempotent or nilpotent, that might simplify things. Let me check the eigenvalues of A. 

To find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0. Let's compute that. The determinant of (3 - λ, 7; -1, -2 - λ) is (3 - λ)(-2 - λ) - (7)(-1). Let me calculate that:

(3 - λ)(-2 - λ) = -6 -3λ + 2λ + λ² = λ² - λ -6
Then subtract 7*(-1) = +7. So the determinant is λ² - λ -6 +7 = λ² - λ +1. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check:

Wait, the determinant is (3 - λ)(-2 - λ) - (7)(-1). 

First term: (3 - λ)(-2 - λ) = 3*(-2) + 3*(-λ) - λ*(-2) - λ*(-λ) = -6 -3λ +2λ +λ² = λ² -λ -6.

Second term: - (7)(-1) = +7. So the determinant is λ² -λ -6 +7 = λ² -λ +1. So the characteristic equation is λ² - λ +1 = 0. 

The roots of this equation are λ = [1 ± sqrt(1 - 4)] / 2 = [1 ± sqrt(-3)] / 2. So the eigenvalues are complex: (1 + i√3)/2 and (1 - i√3)/2. These are complex conjugates. Hmm, so A has complex eigenvalues. That means it's not diagonalizable over the reals, but maybe it can be put into a real Jordan form, or perhaps we can use the Cayley-Hamilton theorem. 

Cayley-Hamilton theorem states that a matrix satisfies its own characteristic equation. So if the characteristic equation is λ² - λ +1 = 0, then A² - A + I = 0. Let me verify that. 

Compute A²: 

A = [[3,7], [-1,-2]]

A² = A * A = [[3*3 + 7*(-1), 3*7 + 7*(-2)], [-1*3 + (-2)*(-1), -1*7 + (-2)*(-2)]]

Calculating each entry:

Top left: 9 -7 = 2

Top right: 21 -14 = 7

Bottom left: -3 +2 = -1

Bottom right: -7 +4 = -3

So A² = [[2,7], [-1,-3]]

Now, according to Cayley-Hamilton, A² - A + I should be zero. Let's check:

A² - A + I = [[2,7], [-1,-3]] - [[3,7], [-1,-2]] + [[1,0], [0,1]]

Compute entry-wise:

Top left: 2 -3 +1 = 0

Top right:7 -7 +0 = 0

Bottom left: -1 -(-1) +0 = 0

Bottom right: -3 -(-2) +1 = -3 +2 +1 = 0

Yes, it works! So A² - A + I = 0. Therefore, A² = A - I. That's a useful relation. 

So, if I can express higher powers of A in terms of lower powers, maybe even A³, A⁴, etc., can be expressed in terms of A and I. Let's see:

Given A² = A - I, then:

A³ = A² * A = (A - I) * A = A² - A = (A - I) - A = -I

Wait, A³ = A² * A = (A - I) * A = A² - A = (A - I) - A = -I. So A³ = -I.

Then A⁴ = A³ * A = (-I) * A = -A

A⁵ = A⁴ * A = (-A) * A = -A² = -(A - I) = -A + I

A⁶ = A⁵ * A = (-A + I) * A = -A² + A = -(A - I) + A = -A + I + A = I

A⁷ = A⁶ * A = I * A = A

A⁸ = A⁷ * A = A * A = A² = A - I

Wait, so the cycle repeats every 6 powers? Let me check:

A¹ = A

A² = A - I

A³ = -I

A⁴ = -A

A⁵ = -A + I

A⁶ = I

A⁷ = A

Yes, so the cycle is every 6 powers. So the pattern repeats every 6. That is, A^(k+6) = A^k for all k. Therefore, we can compute A^k by finding k modulo 6. 

So, to compute A^27, we can divide 27 by 6. 27 ÷ 6 is 4 with remainder 3. So 27 = 6*4 + 3. Therefore, A^27 = A^(6*4 +3) = (A^6)^4 * A^3 = I^4 * (-I) = I * (-I) = -I.

Similarly, A^31: 31 ÷6 is 5*6=30, remainder 1. So 31=6*5+1. Therefore, A^31 = (A^6)^5 * A^1 = I^5 * A = A.

A^40: 40 ÷6 is 6*6=36, remainder 4. So 40=6*6+4. Therefore, A^40 = (A^6)^6 * A^4 = I^6 * (-A) = -A.

Therefore, A^27 + A^31 + A^40 = (-I) + A + (-A) = (-I) + (A - A) = -I + 0 = -I.

Wait, is that correct? Let me verify each step:

First, confirm the cycle:

A^1 = A

A^2 = A - I

A^3 = -I

A^4 = -A

A^5 = -A + I

A^6 = I

Then A^7 = A^6 * A = I * A = A

A^8 = A^7 * A = A * A = A² = A - I

Yes, so the cycle is indeed 6. Therefore, exponents cycle modulo 6. 

Therefore, for any exponent k, A^k = A^(k mod 6). If k mod 6 is 0, then A^k = I, except when k=0, which is the identity matrix. 

So:

A^27: 27 divided by 6 is 4 with remainder 3. So 27 mod 6 = 3. Therefore, A^27 = A^3 = -I.

A^31: 31 divided by 6 is 5 with remainder 1. So 31 mod 6 =1. Therefore, A^31 = A^1 = A.

A^40: 40 divided by 6 is 6 with remainder 4. So 40 mod6=4. Therefore, A^40 = A^4 = -A.

Therefore, A^27 + A^31 + A^40 = (-I) + A + (-A) = -I + (A - A) = -I + 0 = -I.

So the result is -I, which is the 2x2 identity matrix multiplied by -1. So the final answer is:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}
\]

But let me check once again if the cycle is correct. Let's compute A^6:

From earlier steps, A^6 = I. Then A^7 = A^6 * A = I * A = A. Then A^8 = A^7 * A = A * A = A² = A - I. Then A^9 = A^8 * A = (A - I) * A = A² - A = (A - I) - A = -I. Then A^10 = A^9 * A = (-I) * A = -A. A^11 = A^10 * A = (-A) * A = -A² = -(A - I) = -A + I. A^12 = A^11 * A = (-A + I) * A = -A² + A = -(A - I) + A = -A + I + A = I. So yes, the cycle repeats every 6. Therefore, the calculation is correct.

Thus, the sum is -I.
