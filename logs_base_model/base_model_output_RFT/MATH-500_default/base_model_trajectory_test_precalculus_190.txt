Okay, so I need to find the product of these sines: sin 20°, sin 40°, sin 60°, sin 80°, sin 100°, sin 120°, sin 140°, and sin 160°. Hmm, that's eight terms multiplied together. Let me think how to approach this. 

First, I remember that there are product formulas for multiple sine terms. Maybe there's a formula that can help here. Let me recall. Oh, right, there's a formula for the product of sines in an arithmetic sequence. But here, the angles aren't in an arithmetic progression, but maybe there's a way to pair them or use some symmetry.

Looking at the angles: 20°, 40°, 60°, 80°, 100°, 120°, 140°, 160°. Wait, these angles are symmetric around 90°, right? Let's check: 20° and 160°, 40° and 140°, 60° and 120°, 80° and 100°. Each pair adds up to 180°, except maybe the middle one? Wait, there are eight terms, so the middle would be between the 4th and 5th terms, which are 80° and 100°, and their average is 90°. So they are symmetric around 90°. 

Also, note that sin(180° - θ) = sin θ. So sin 100° = sin(80°), sin 120° = sin(60°), sin 140° = sin(40°), and sin 160° = sin(20°). Wait, so actually, the product is [sin 20° sin 40° sin 60° sin 80°]^2. Because sin 100° = sin 80°, sin 120° = sin 60°, etc. So this product is the square of sin 20° sin 40° sin 60° sin 80°. That might simplify things.

So if I compute sin 20° sin 40° sin 60° sin 80° first and then square the result, that should give me the answer. Let me confirm this symmetry again. The original terms are sin 20°, sin 40°, sin 60°, sin 80°, sin 100°, sin 120°, sin 140°, sin 160°. Since sin(180° - θ) = sin θ, so sin 100° = sin(80°), sin 120° = sin(60°), sin 140° = sin(40°), sin 160° = sin(20°). Therefore, the original product is equal to [sin 20° sin 40° sin 60° sin 80°]^2. So that reduces the problem to computing the product of four terms and then squaring it.

Now, how do I compute sin 20° sin 40° sin 60° sin 80°? Maybe there's a formula for the product of sines in an arithmetic progression. Let me recall. There's a formula for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression, which is given by:

Product_{k=1}^{n-1} sin(kπ/(2n)) = sqrt(n)/2^{n-1}

But wait, that's for angles in radians, and in the form of kπ/(2n). Let me check if that applies here. Alternatively, there's another formula for the product of sines when they are equally spaced. Let me see.

Alternatively, I remember that for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression with common difference θ, there's a formula involving powers of 2 and some sine terms. Let me try to think. Maybe using complex numbers or multiple-angle identities.

Alternatively, perhaps using the identity sin θ = cos(90° - θ). Wait, since 20°, 40°, 60°, 80° are all less than 90°, so maybe not directly helpful. Let me try to pair terms. Let's pair sin 20° and sin 80°, and sin 40° and sin 60°. Then, using the identity sin A sin B = [cos(A - B) - cos(A + B)] / 2.

So first pair: sin 20° sin 80°. Let's compute that.

sin 20° sin 80° = [cos(60°) - cos(100°)] / 2.

Similarly, sin 40° sin 60° = [cos(20°) - cos(100°)] / 2.

Wait, so the product becomes:

[cos(60°) - cos(100°)] / 2 * [cos(20°) - cos(100°)] / 2.

Hmm, that might not be straightforward. Let's compute each term:

cos(60°) is 0.5, cos(100°) is cos(100°) ≈ -0.1736, but maybe exact value? Wait, cos(100°) = -cos(80°), since cos(180° - θ) = -cos θ. So cos(100°) = -cos(80°). Similarly, cos(20°) is just cos(20°).

So let's substitute:

First term: [0.5 - (-cos80°)] / 2 = [0.5 + cos80°] / 2.

Second term: [cos20° - (-cos80°)] / 2 = [cos20° + cos80°] / 2.

Therefore, the product is:

[0.5 + cos80°]/2 * [cos20° + cos80°]/2.

Hmm, maybe this can be further simplified. Let me compute this step by step.

First, compute [0.5 + cos80°] * [cos20° + cos80°].

Multiply out the terms:

0.5*cos20° + 0.5*cos80° + cos80°*cos20° + cos80°*cos80°.

Hmm, this is getting a bit messy. Maybe another approach. Let's think if there's a better way to compute sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°.

Wait, another idea: maybe use the identity for sin θ sin(60° - θ) sin(60° + θ) = (sin3θ)/4. Let me check if that's applicable here.

Wait, if I take θ = 20°, then sin20° sin40° sin80°. Wait, because 60° - 20° = 40°, and 60° + 20° = 80°. So sin20° sin40° sin80° = (sin60°)/4. Wait, is that correct?

Let me verify. The identity is sin θ sin(60° - θ) sin(60° + θ) = (sin3θ)/4. So if θ = 20°, then:

sin20° sin40° sin80° = (sin60°)/4. Therefore, sin20° sin40° sin80° = (sqrt(3)/2)/4 = sqrt(3)/8. Is that right?

Wait, let's compute sin20° sin40° sin80°.

Alternatively, compute sin20° sin80° first. As before, sin20° sin80° = [cos60° - cos100°]/2.

We know cos60° = 0.5, and cos100° = -cos80°, so sin20° sin80° = [0.5 - (-cos80°)]/2 = [0.5 + cos80°]/2.

Then multiply by sin40°:

[0.5 + cos80°]/2 * sin40°.

Hmm, let's compute [0.5 + cos80°] * sin40° / 2.

Alternatively, maybe use another identity. Let me think. Let's use the identity sin A + sin B = 2 sin[(A+B)/2] cos[(A-B)/2]. Wait, but here we have [0.5 + cos80°] and sin40°. Maybe express 0.5 as cos60°, since cos60° = 0.5.

So [cos60° + cos80°] * sin40° / 2.

Then, using the identity cos A + cos B = 2 cos[(A+B)/2] cos[(A-B)/2]. So cos60° + cos80° = 2 cos70° cos(-10°) = 2 cos70° cos10°.

Therefore, [2 cos70° cos10°] * sin40° / 2 = cos70° cos10° sin40°.

So now, we have cos70° cos10° sin40°. Let's see. Maybe use product-to-sum identities here.

First, compute cos70° cos10°. Using the identity cos A cos B = [cos(A+B) + cos(A-B)] / 2.

So cos70° cos10° = [cos80° + cos60°]/2.

Therefore, cos70° cos10° sin40° = [cos80° + cos60°]/2 * sin40°.

Now, multiply this by sin40°:

[cos80° + cos60°]/2 * sin40°.

Again, use the identity [cos A + cos B] sin C = 2 cos[(A+C)/2] cos[(B - C)/2] + 2 cos[(B + C)/2] sin[(A - C)/2]. Wait, no, perhaps better to distribute the multiplication.

First, cos80° sin40° + cos60° sin40°.

Compute each term:

cos80° sin40° = [sin(40° + 80°) + sin(40° - 80°)] / 2 = [sin120° + sin(-40°)] / 2 = [sin120° - sin40°]/2.

Similarly, cos60° sin40° = [sin(40° + 60°) + sin(40° - 60°)] / 2 = [sin100° + sin(-20°)] / 2 = [sin100° - sin20°]/2.

Therefore, combining these:

[ (sin120° - sin40°)/2 + (sin100° - sin20°)/2 ] / 2 = [sin120° - sin40° + sin100° - sin20°]/4.

But sin120° = sin60° = sqrt(3)/2, sin100° = sin80°, sin40° and sin20° are as they are.

So substituting:

[ sqrt(3)/2 - sin40° + sin80° - sin20° ] / 4.

Hmm, this seems to be getting complicated. Maybe there's a better way to compute sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°. Let me try another approach.

Let me recall that sin60° = sqrt(3)/2. So maybe write the product as (sqrt(3)/2) * sin20° sin40° sin80°. Then, if we can compute sin20° sin40° sin80°, multiply by sqrt(3)/2.

Earlier, I thought of using the identity sin θ sin(60° - θ) sin(60° + θ) = (sin3θ)/4. Let me verify that identity.

Using the identity sin3θ = 3sinθ - 4sin³θ. Let me compute sinθ sin(60° - θ) sin(60° + θ).

Multiply sin(60° - θ) sin(60° + θ) first. That's [sin60° cosθ - cos60° sinθ][sin60° cosθ + cos60° sinθ] = (sin60° cosθ)^2 - (cos60° sinθ)^2.

Which is sin²60° cos²θ - cos²60° sin²θ.

Then multiply by sinθ: sinθ [sin²60° cos²θ - cos²60° sin²θ] = sin³θ [sin²60° cot²θ - cos²60°].

Wait, maybe this is not helpful. Alternatively, using complex exponentials.

Alternatively, perhaps use the identity for product of three sines. Wait, I might be overcomplicating. Let me check with θ = 20°.

sin20° sin40° sin80°. Let me compute numerically:

sin20° ≈ 0.3420, sin40° ≈ 0.6428, sin80° ≈ 0.9848. Multiply them: 0.3420 * 0.6428 ≈ 0.2199, then * 0.9848 ≈ 0.2165.

Now, (sqrt(3)/4) ≈ 0.4330 / 4 ≈ 0.10825. Wait, but 0.2165 ≈ 2 * 0.10825. Hmm, so maybe sin20° sin40° sin80° = (sqrt(3)/4) * 2 = sqrt(3)/2? Wait, but sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866, which is not close to 0.2165. So that identity must not hold.

Wait, maybe the identity is different. Let me check with θ = 10°. sin10° sin50° sin70°. Let me compute that. sin10° ≈ 0.1736, sin50° ≈ 0.7660, sin70° ≈ 0.9397. Product ≈ 0.1736 * 0.7660 ≈ 0.1327, * 0.9397 ≈ 0.1245. On the other hand, (sin30°)/4 = 0.5/4 = 0.125. So that's close. So maybe the identity is sinθ sin(60° - θ) sin(60° + θ) = (sin3θ)/4. Let's check with θ = 10°: sin10° sin50° sin70° = (sin30°)/4 = 0.125. Which matches the numerical value.

Therefore, the identity holds. So for θ = 20°, sin20° sin40° sin80° = (sin60°)/4. Since 3θ = 60°, so sin60°/4 = (sqrt(3)/2)/4 = sqrt(3)/8 ≈ 0.2165, which matches the numerical calculation. Great!

Therefore, sin20° sin40° sin80° = sqrt(3)/8.

Then, the original product is [sqrt(3)/8]^2 = 3/64.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the original product is [sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°]^2. Wait, but according to the symmetry earlier, the original product is [sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°]^2. But in our calculation, we found sin20° sin40° sin80° = sqrt(3)/8. But where does the sin60° come in?

Wait, let's go back. The original product is sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80° sin100° sin120° sin140° sin160°, which is [sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°]^2. But according to the symmetry, sin100° = sin80°, sin120° = sin60°, sin140° = sin40°, sin160° = sin20°. So the product is [sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°]^2.

But when we computed sin20° sin40° sin80°, we got sqrt(3)/8. Then multiplying by sin60°, which is sqrt(3)/2, gives us [sqrt(3)/8 * sqrt(3)/2] = (3/16). Then squaring that gives (3/16)^2 = 9/256.

Wait, but wait, let me check again. Wait, in the original product, the four terms are sin20°, sin40°, sin60°, sin80°. So when we pair sin20° sin80° and sin40° sin60°, we can use the identity for product of sines.

Alternatively, maybe use the identity for the product of four sines. Let me think. There's an identity for product of four sines in arithmetic progression. Let me check.

Alternatively, since we already used the identity for three sines, maybe extend that. Let me see.

Alternatively, since we have four terms, maybe use multiple applications of the identity.

But perhaps it's easier to use the formula for the product of sines.

Wait, here's another idea. Let's use the identity for the product of sines in terms of multiple angles. Let me recall that:

sinθ sin(60° - θ) sin(60° + θ) = (sin3θ)/4.

But in our case, we have four terms. Let me see if I can decompose them into two pairs each of which can be expressed using that identity.

Wait, we have sin20°, sin40°, sin60°, sin80°.

If we group sin20° sin80° and sin40° sin60°, as we did before, each pair can be expressed using the identity for product of two sines.

Earlier, sin20° sin80° = [cos60° - cos100°]/2 = [0.5 + cos80°]/2.

Similarly, sin40° sin60° = [cos20° - cos100°]/2 = [cos20° + cos80°]/2, since cos100° = -cos80°.

Therefore, the product of the two pairs is:

[0.5 + cos80°]/2 * [cos20° + cos80°]/2 = [ (0.5 + cos80°)(cos20° + cos80°) ] / 4.

Expanding the numerator:

0.5*cos20° + 0.5*cos80° + cos80°*cos20° + cos80°*cos80°.

Hmm, this seems complicated. Let me compute each term numerically to check.

cos20° ≈ 0.9397, cos80° ≈ 0.1736.

So:

0.5 * 0.9397 ≈ 0.46985,

0.5 * 0.1736 ≈ 0.0868,

cos80° * cos20° ≈ 0.1736 * 0.9397 ≈ 0.163,

cos80° * cos80° ≈ 0.0301.

Adding them up: 0.46985 + 0.0868 + 0.163 + 0.0301 ≈ 0.74975.

Then divide by 4: 0.74975 / 4 ≈ 0.1874.

But according to the previous calculation, [sqrt(3)/8 * sqrt(3)/2]^2 = (3/16)^2 = 9/256 ≈ 0.0352. Wait, but 0.1874 is about 5.85 times larger. So something is wrong here. Maybe my grouping is incorrect.

Wait, actually, the original product is [sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°]^2. We found sin20° sin40° sin80° = sqrt(3)/8. Then sin60° = sqrt(3)/2. So multiplying them together gives (sqrt(3)/8) * (sqrt(3)/2) = (3/16). Then squaring gives (3/16)^2 = 9/256 ≈ 0.03515625. But the numerical calculation of the product [sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°]^2 is approximately (0.3420 * 0.6428 * 0.8660 * 0.9848)^2 ≈ (0.3420*0.6428 ≈ 0.2199; 0.8660*0.9848 ≈ 0.8535; then 0.2199*0.8535 ≈ 0.188; then squared ≈ 0.0353). Which matches 9/256 ≈ 0.03515625. So that's correct. Therefore, the product [sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°]^2 = (3/16)^2 = 9/256.

Therefore, going back, the original product is [sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°]^2 = (3/16)^2 = 9/256. Therefore, the answer is 9/256.

But wait, let me cross-verify this with another approach to ensure that there's no mistake.

Another approach: Let's consider the product of all eight terms. Since they are symmetric around 90°, as we saw earlier, the product is [sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°]^2. So we need to compute [sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°]^2.

We already computed sin20° sin40° sin80° = sqrt(3)/8. Then multiplying by sin60° = sqrt(3)/2, gives sqrt(3)/8 * sqrt(3)/2 = 3/16. Then squaring gives 9/256. So that's consistent.

Alternatively, let's use the formula for the product of sines. There's a general formula for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression. For angles θ, 2θ, 3θ,...,nθ. But in our case, the angles are 20°, 40°, 60°, 80°, which are multiples of 20°, but not exactly in arithmetic progression. Wait, 20°, 40°, 60°, 80° are in arithmetic progression with common difference 20°. So n=4, θ=20°, so the product is product_{k=1}^4 sin(k*20°). 

There's a formula for the product of sines in arithmetic progression: 

Product_{k=1}^{n-1} sin(kπ/(2n)) = sqrt(n)/2^{n-1}.

But in our case, the angles are in degrees, not radians, and they are multiples of 20°, not π/(2n) radians. Let me check if there's a similar formula.

Alternatively, another formula: For angles θ, 2θ, ..., nθ, the product can be expressed in terms of multiple angles. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, use complex numbers. Let's recall that the product of sines can be related to the roots of unity. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps using the identity for sin(nθ) in terms of products of sines. Let me recall that:

sin(nθ) = 2^{n-1} product_{k=1}^{n-1} sin(θ + kπ/n).

But maybe that's not directly applicable here.

Alternatively, consider the identity that the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression can be expressed as a determinant or through roots of polynomials. However, this might be too complicated.

Alternatively, use logarithms to turn the product into a sum. But that might not be helpful here.

Alternatively, use the formula for the product of multiple sines:

If we have product_{k=1}^{n} sin(a + (k-1)d), then it can be expressed in terms of some multiple-angle formula. But I don't remember the exact formula.

Alternatively, maybe use the identity sin2θ = 2 sinθ cosθ. Let's see:

sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°. Let's pair sin20° sin80° and sin40° sin60°.

sin20° sin80° = [cos60° - cos100°]/2 = [0.5 - (-cos80°)]/2 = [0.5 + cos80°]/2.

Similarly, sin40° sin60° = [cos20° - cos100°]/2 = [cos20° + cos80°]/2.

Then multiply these two results:

[0.5 + cos80°]/2 * [cos20° + cos80°]/2 = [ (0.5 + cos80°)(cos20° + cos80°) ] / 4.

Expanding numerator:

0.5*cos20° + 0.5*cos80° + cos80°*cos20° + cos80°*cos80°.

Compute each term:

0.5*cos20° ≈ 0.5*0.9397 ≈ 0.46985,

0.5*cos80° ≈ 0.5*0.1736 ≈ 0.0868,

cos80°*cos20° ≈ 0.1736*0.9397 ≈ 0.163,

cos80°*cos80° ≈ 0.0301.

Adding these up: ≈ 0.46985 + 0.0868 + 0.163 + 0.0301 ≈ 0.74975.

Divide by 4: ≈ 0.74975 / 4 ≈ 0.1874.

But according to the previous calculation, sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80° ≈ 0.3420 * 0.6428 * 0.8660 * 0.9848 ≈ 0.3420*0.6428 ≈ 0.2199, 0.8660*0.9848 ≈ 0.8535, then 0.2199*0.8535 ≈ 0.188. Then, squaring gives ≈ 0.0353. Wait, but if the product sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80° ≈ 0.188, then squaring gives ≈ 0.0353, which is 9/256 ≈ 0.03515625. So that's consistent.

But when we compute [0.5 + cos80°]/2 * [cos20° + cos80°]/2 ≈ 0.1874, which is approximately 0.188, which matches the product sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°. Then squaring that gives 0.188² ≈ 0.0353, which is 9/256. So that's correct.

Therefore, the final answer is 9/256.

Alternatively, let me check if there's a formula that directly gives the product of these sines. Since we have four terms: sin20°, sin40°, sin60°, sin80°. Let me see.

Another approach: Use complex numbers. Let me recall that sinθ = (e^{iθ} - e^{-iθ})/(2i). So the product of sines can be written as the product of (e^{iθ} - e^{-iθ})/(2i) for each θ. But this might be complicated.

Alternatively, note that the product of sines can be related to the roots of unity. For example, the product over k=1 to n-1 of sin(kπ/n) = n/(2^{n-1})). But our case is different since the angles are 20°, 40°, 60°, 80°, which are multiples of 20°, but not π/9 radians or something similar.

Alternatively, let me consider the identity for the product of sines when angles are in arithmetic progression. The identity is:

Product_{k=1}^{n} sin(a + (k-1)d) = [2^{1-n} sin(nθ/2)] / [some function], not sure.

Alternatively, use logarithms. Let me take the logarithm of the product:

ln(sin20°) + ln(sin40°) + ln(sin60°) + ln(sin80°).

But this would require numerical computation, which might not be helpful here.

Alternatively, use the identity for sinθ sin(60° - θ) sin(60° + θ) = (sin3θ)/4, which we used earlier. But in our case, we have four terms, not three.

Alternatively, use the identity for sinθ sin(60° - θ) sin(60° + θ) sin(θ + 60°). Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, look for symmetry or known product formulas. Wait, since the angles are 20°, 40°, 60°, 80°, which are 20°, 2*20°, 3*20°, 4*20°, so multiples of 20°, which is π/9 radians. Wait, 20° is π/9 radians. So 20°, 40°, 60°, 80° are π/9, 2π/9, 3π/9=π/3, 4π/9. So they are the first four multiples of π/9. Then, the product sin(π/9) sin(2π/9) sin(π/3) sin(4π/9). 

There's a formula for the product of sines of the form sin(kπ/n) for k=1 to m. Let me recall that for n odd, the product_{k=1}^{(n-1)/2} sin(kπ/n) = sqrt(n)/2^{(n-1)/2}}. But in our case, n=9, so product_{k=1}^4 sin(kπ/9) = sqrt(9)/2^{4} = 3/16. Which is exactly the product we found earlier: sin(π/9) sin(2π/9) sin(3π/9) sin(4π/9) = 3/16. Therefore, product_{k=1}^{4} sin(kπ/9) = 3/16. 

Since π/9 is 20°, this matches our case. Therefore, sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80° = 3/16. Therefore, squaring this gives 9/256. Therefore, the answer is 9/256.

Therefore, the final answer is $\boxed{\dfrac{9}{256}}$.
Therefore, the final answer is $\boxed{\dfrac{9}{256}}$.
