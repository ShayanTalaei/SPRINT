Okay, so I need to figure out what 1 raised to the power of (2^235423523) is. Let me start by recalling some basic exponent rules. I remember that any number raised to any power is just 1 if the base is 1, right? For example, 1^1 is 1, 1^2 is 1, and so on. So, if the base is 1, no matter how big the exponent is, the result should still be 1. 

But wait, let me make sure I'm not missing something here. The exponent here is 2^235423523, which is a massive number. But since the base is 1, multiplying 1 by itself any number of times will still result in 1. So even if the exponent is enormous, like 2^235423523, it doesn't change the outcome. 

Let me verify this with a simpler example. Let's say I have 1^2. That's 1*1 = 1. 1^3 is 1*1*1 = 1. Even 1^1000000 is still 1. So regardless of the exponent, as long as the base is 1, the result is always 1. Therefore, even though 2^235423523 is a huge exponent, 1 raised to that power should still be 1. 

Is there any case where 1 raised to a power isn't 1? Hmm, I think if the exponent is 0, then 1^0 is 1 as well. Wait, no, actually 1^0 is defined as 1. But in this case, the exponent is 2^235423523, which is definitely not zero. So there's no issue there. 

Another thought: maybe there's a trick here with the exponent being so large? For example, sometimes with limits or infinity, but in this case, we're dealing with discrete exponents. Since exponents are integers here, even if they're very large, 1 to any positive integer power is still 1. 

So, putting it all together, the answer should be 1. Let me just write that down.
