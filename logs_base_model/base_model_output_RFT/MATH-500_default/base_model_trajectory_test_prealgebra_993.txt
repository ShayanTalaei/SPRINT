Okay, let's see. The problem is about converting lire to dollars using the exchange rate implied by the price of gelato in both countries. So, in Italy in 1992, a scoop of gelato cost 1200 lire, and in the U.S., it was $1.50. The question is asking how many dollars would 1,000,000 lire be equivalent to. 

First, I need to figure out the exchange rate between lire and dollars based on the gelato prices. Since the same amount of gelato costs different amounts in lire and dollars, the exchange rate should reflect the value of lire in terms of dollars. 

Let me think. If 1200 lire equals $1.50, then to find out how much 1 lire is in dollars, I can divide $1.50 by 1200. Let me write that down. 

$1.50 divided by 1200 lire. Let me compute that. 1.50 divided by 1200. Well, 1.5 divided by 12 is 0.125. But since it's 1.5 divided by 1200, that's 0.125 divided by 100, which is 0.00125. So, 1 lire is equal to $0.00125. 

Wait, that seems really low. Let me check again. If 1200 lire is $1.50, then 1 lire is $1.50 / 1200. Let's compute that. 1.5 divided by 1200. 1.5 divided by 12 is 0.125, so 1.5 divided by 1200 is 0.00125. Yes, that's correct. So, 1 lire = $0.00125. 

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as lire per dollar. If $1.50 buys 1200 lire, then $1 buys 1200 / 1.50 lire. Let's compute that. 1200 divided by 1.5. 1200 divided by 1.5 is the same as 1200 multiplied by 2/3. 1200 * 2 = 2400, divided by 3 is 800. So, $1 is equivalent to 800 lire. Therefore, 1 lire is $1 / 800. Let's compute that. 1 divided by 800 is 0.00125. So, same result. 

So, the exchange rate is 1 lire = $0.00125. 

Now, the question is asking how many dollars are equivalent to 1,000,000 lire. So, if 1 lire is $0.00125, then 1,000,000 lire would be 1,000,000 multiplied by 0.00125 dollars. Let me compute that. 

1,000,000 * 0.00125. Let's break that down. 1,000,000 * 0.001 is 1000. Then, 1,000,000 * 0.00025 is 250. So, adding those together, 1000 + 250 = 1250. Therefore, 1,000,000 lire is equivalent to $1250. 

Wait, let me verify that another way. If 1 lire is $0.00125, then 1,000 lire is $1.25. So, 1,000 lire = $1.25. Then, scaling up, 1,000,000 lire is 1,000 times that. 1.25 * 1000 = $1250. Yep, same result. 

Alternatively, using the lire per dollar rate. Since $1 is 800 lire, then $1 buys 800 lire. So, to find out how many dollars buy 1,000,000 lire, divide 1,000,000 by 800. Let's compute that. 1,000,000 divided by 800. Let's simplify. 1,000,000 / 800 = (1,000,000 / 100) / 8 = 10,000 / 8 = 1,250. So, 1,250 dollars. 

Same answer. So, whether I compute lire per dollar or dollars per lire, I get the same result. 

Therefore, the answer should be $1,250. 

But let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me check the lire per dollar again. If $1.50 buys 1200 lire, then $1 buys 1200 / 1.50 = 800 lire. So, 1,000,000 lire divided by 800 lire per dollar gives 1,250 dollars. Yes. 

Alternatively, using the exchange rate directly. If 1200 lire = $1.50, then 1 lire = $1.50 / 1200 = $0.00125. Then, 1,000,000 lire * $0.00125 = $1,250. 

All methods lead to the same answer. So, I think that's correct. 

Just to recap: 

1. Find the exchange rate per lire by dividing the dollar amount by the number of lire. 

2. Multiply the number of lire (1,000,000) by the exchange rate to get the dollar equivalent. 

Alternatively, find how many lire are in one dollar and divide the total lire by that number. 

Either way, the result is $1,250. 

I don't see any mistakes in the calculations here. The exchange rate is correctly derived from the given prices, and the multiplication/division steps are accurate. 

Therefore, the answer should be $1,250.
Therefore, $1,250 would be equivalent to 1,000,000 lire.
