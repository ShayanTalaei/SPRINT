Okay, so I need to find the tangent of angle A in triangle ABC, given that the area of the triangle is equal to a² minus (b - c)². Let me start by recalling some basic formulas related to triangles. 

First, the area of a triangle can be expressed in terms of two sides and the sine of the included angle. Specifically, the area is (1/2)ab sin C, where a and b are two sides, and C is the angle between them. But in this problem, the area is given as a² - (b - c)². Hmm, so maybe I can set up an equation here by equating the two expressions for the area.

But before that, let me make sure I understand the notation. In triangle ABC, the sides opposite angles A, B, and C are a, b, and c respectively. So, side a is opposite angle A, side b opposite angle B, and side c opposite angle C. That's standard notation. So, the sides are labeled a, b, c opposite their respective angles. Got it.

So, the area is given by a² - (b - c)². Let me expand that expression first. Expanding (b - c)² gives b² - 2bc + c². Therefore, the area is a² - (b² - 2bc + c²) = a² - b² + 2bc - c². So, area = a² - b² - c² + 2bc.

Alternatively, I can write that as area = (a² - b² - c²) + 2bc. Hmm, interesting. Now, I also know that in a triangle, the Law of Cosines relates the sides and the cosine of an angle. The Law of Cosines states that a² = b² + c² - 2bc cos A. Let me write that down: a² = b² + c² - 2bc cos A. So, if I rearrange this equation, I can solve for cos A: cos A = (b² + c² - a²)/(2bc). That's a standard formula. 

Now, since the problem asks for tan A, which is sin A divided by cos A, I need expressions for both sin A and cos A. I already have cos A from the Law of Cosines. For sin A, I can use the Law of Sines, which states that a/sin A = b/sin B = c/sin C = 2R, where R is the radius of the circumscribed circle. But maybe there's a better way using the area formula.

Wait, the area can also be expressed as (1/2)bc sin A. Because in triangle ABC, sides b and c enclose angle A, so the area is (1/2)*b*c*sin A. So, area = (1/2)bc sin A. 

But according to the problem, the area is a² - (b - c)², which we expanded to a² - b² - c² + 2bc. So, setting these equal:

(1/2)bc sin A = a² - b² - c² + 2bc.

Hmm, so if I can relate this to the Law of Cosines, which gives a² = b² + c² - 2bc cos A. Let me substitute that into the area equation. 

Substituting a² from the Law of Cosines into the area expression:

(1/2)bc sin A = (b² + c² - 2bc cos A) - b² - c² + 2bc.

Simplify the right-hand side:

(b² + c² - 2bc cos A) - b² - c² + 2bc = -2bc cos A + 2bc.

So, the equation becomes:

(1/2)bc sin A = -2bc cos A + 2bc.

Let me factor out 2bc on the right-hand side:

(1/2)bc sin A = 2bc(1 - cos A).

Divide both sides by bc (assuming bc ≠ 0, which they can't be in a triangle):

(1/2) sin A = 2(1 - cos A).

Multiply both sides by 2:

sin A = 4(1 - cos A).

So, sin A = 4 - 4 cos A.

But from the Pythagorean identity, sin² A + cos² A = 1. Let me write sin A as 4(1 - cos A):

sin A = 4(1 - cos A).

Let me square both sides to use the identity:

sin² A = 16(1 - cos A)².

But sin² A = 1 - cos² A, so substitute:

1 - cos² A = 16(1 - 2 cos A + cos² A).

Expand the right-hand side:

1 - cos² A = 16 - 32 cos A + 16 cos² A.

Bring all terms to one side:

1 - cos² A - 16 + 32 cos A - 16 cos² A = 0.

Combine like terms:

(1 - 16) + (-cos² A - 16 cos² A) + 32 cos A = 0.

Which simplifies to:

-15 -17 cos² A + 32 cos A = 0.

Multiply both sides by -1 to make the quadratic coefficient positive:

15 + 17 cos² A - 32 cos A = 0.

Rearranged:

17 cos² A - 32 cos A + 15 = 0.

Now, this is a quadratic equation in terms of cos A. Let me denote x = cos A. Then the equation becomes:

17x² - 32x + 15 = 0.

Let me solve this quadratic equation. The quadratic formula is x = [32 ± sqrt(32² - 4*17*15)]/(2*17).

Compute discriminant D:

D = 32² - 4*17*15 = 1024 - 1020 = 4.

So sqrt(D) = 2.

Therefore, x = [32 ± 2]/(34).

So two solutions:

x = (32 + 2)/34 = 34/34 = 1,

x = (32 - 2)/34 = 30/34 = 15/17.

Now, cos A = 1 would imply angle A is 0 degrees, which is impossible in a triangle. Therefore, the valid solution is cos A = 15/17.

So, cos A = 15/17. Then, sin A can be found using Pythagorean identity:

sin A = sqrt(1 - (15/17)²) = sqrt(1 - 225/289) = sqrt(64/289) = 8/17.

Therefore, tan A = sin A / cos A = (8/17)/(15/17) = 8/15.

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me check if there was any mistake in the algebra.

Starting from sin A = 4(1 - cos A). Then squaring gives sin² A = 16(1 - 2 cos A + cos² A). Then substituting sin² A = 1 - cos² A:

1 - cos² A = 16 - 32 cos A + 16 cos² A.

Bring all terms to left:

1 - cos² A -16 +32 cos A -16 cos² A = 0.

Combine like terms:

(1 -16) + (-cos² A -16 cos² A) +32 cos A = 0.

-15 -17 cos² A +32 cos A =0.

Multiply by -1:

15 +17 cos² A -32 cos A=0.

Then 17 cos² A -32 cos A +15=0. Correct.

Quadratic formula: [32 ± sqrt(32² -4*17*15)]/(2*17). 32² is 1024, 4*17*15=1020. So sqrt(4)=2. So solutions (32±2)/34. 34/34=1, 30/34=15/17. Correct.

Thus, cos A=15/17, sin A=8/17. Therefore, tan A=8/15. That seems right.

But let me verify with the original area formula. If tan A=8/15, then sin A=8/17, cos A=15/17. Then area=(1/2)*b*c*(8/17). Also, a² - (b - c)². Let's see if these can be equal.

From the Law of Cosines, a² = b² + c² - 2bc*(15/17). So a² = b² + c² - (30/17) bc.

Then the area is (1/2) bc sin A = (1/2) bc*(8/17) = (4/17) bc.

The given area is a² - (b - c)² = a² - (b² - 2bc + c²). Substituting a² from above:

(b² + c² - (30/17) bc) - b² - c² + 2bc = - (30/17) bc + 2bc = (-30/17 + 34/17) bc = (4/17) bc.

Which matches the area expression. So that checks out. Therefore, the answer is tan A = 8/15.

But let me check once more. If tan A is 8/15, then angle A is acute, which is consistent with a triangle. The triangle's sides must satisfy triangle inequalities, but since the problem doesn't specify any particular constraints on the sides, as long as the sides are positive and satisfy the triangle inequality, the result should hold.

Therefore, after thorough checking, the answer is 8/15.

**Final Answer**
The value of $\tan A$ is $\boxed{\dfrac{8}{15}}$.
Therefore, $\tan A$ is $\boxed{\frac{8}{15}}$.
