Okay, let's see. The problem is about three people from different countries—Navin from Mauritius, Luka from Croatia, and Ian from Botswana—who are talking about their part-time jobs. They want to know who earns the most after working an eight-hour day. The question gives their hourly rates in their respective currencies and the exchange rates of each currency to US dollars. Hmm, so I need to convert each of their earnings into a common currency to compare who makes the most. Since the exchange rates are given to US dollars, converting each person's earnings to USD would make sense.

First, let me list out the information given:

- Navin: 160 Mauritius rupees (MR) per hour.
- Luka: 25 Croatian kuna (HRK) per hour.
- Ian: 34 Botswana pula (BWP) per hour.

Exchange rates:

- 1 US dollar ($) = 32.35 MR
- 1 $ = 5.18 HRK
- 1 $ = 6.95 BWP

They worked eight hours each. So, each person's total earnings in their own currency would be their hourly rate multiplied by 8. Then, convert that total to USD using the respective exchange rate. The person with the highest USD amount after conversion will be the one who earns the most.

Let me break it down step by step.

Starting with Navin. He makes 160 MR per hour. For eight hours, that's 160 * 8. Let me calculate that. 160 times 8 is 1,280 MR. Now, to convert that to USD, since 1$ = 32.35 MR, we divide the total MR by 32.35. So, 1,280 / 32.35. Let me compute that. Hmm, 32.35 times 40 is 1,294, which is a bit more than 1,280. So, approximately 39.55 dollars. Let me verify: 32.35 * 39 = 1,261.65, and 32.35 * 39.55 would be 32.35*39 + 32.35*0.55. 32.35*0.55 is about 17.79, so total around 1,261.65 +17.79 = 1,279.44. Close to 1,280, so approximately $39.55.

Next, Luka. He makes 25 HRK per hour. Eight hours would be 25 * 8 = 200 HRK. To convert to USD, divide by the exchange rate of 5.18. So, 200 / 5.18. Let me calculate that. 5.18 times 38 is 196.84. 200 - 196.84 = 3.16. So, 3.16 /5.18 ≈ 0.61. So total USD is approximately 38.61.

Wait, let me check again. 5.18 * 38.61 = 5.18*38 + 5.18*0.61. 5.18*38 is 196.84, and 5.18*0.61≈3.16. So total 196.84 +3.16=200. Perfect. So Luka earns approximately $38.61.

Now Ian. He makes 34 BWP per hour. Eight hours is 34 *8=272 BWP. Convert to USD using the rate of 6.95. So 272 /6.95. Let's compute that. 6.95 times 39 is 269.05. 272 -269.05=2.95. 2.95 /6.95≈0.424. So total is approximately 39.424, which is roughly $39.42.

Wait, let me check again. 6.95*39.424. Let's compute 6.95*39=269.05, 6.95*0.424≈2.94. So total 269.05 +2.94=271.99, which is almost 272. So yes, $39.42.

So summarizing:

- Navin: ~$39.55
- Luka: ~$38.61
- Ian: ~$39.42

So Navin and Ian are both around $39.55 and $39.42, so Navin is slightly higher. Therefore, Navin earns the most.

But wait, let me double-check all calculations to make sure there are no errors.

Starting with Navin: 160 MR/hour *8 =1,280 MR. 1,280 /32.35. Let's divide 1,280 by 32.35. Let's see, 32.35*39=1,261.65. 1,280 -1,261.65=18.35. Then 18.35 /32.35≈0.567. So total is 39 +0.567≈39.567, so about $39.57. So maybe I was a bit off before, but still around $39.57.

Luka: 25*8=200 HRK. 200 /5.18. 5.18*38=196.84. 200-196.84=3.16. 3.16/5.18≈0.61. So 38.61. That's correct.

Ian: 34*8=272 BWP. 272 /6.95. 6.95*39=269.05. 272-269.05=2.95. 2.95/6.95≈0.424. So 39.424, which is about $39.42. So yes.

Therefore, Navin is slightly higher than Ian, who is higher than Luka. So Navin is the top earner.

But wait, let me check if the exchange rates are correctly applied. For example, 1$=32.35 MR, so 1 MR=1/32.35 ≈0.0309 dollars. So 1,280 MR *0.0309≈1,280*0.0309≈39.55, which matches. Similarly, 200 HRK * (1$/5.18)≈200/5.18≈38.61. 272 BWP * (1$/6.95)≈272/6.95≈39.42. So correct.

Therefore, the answer is Navin.
