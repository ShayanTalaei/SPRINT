Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, we have a complex number z such that z + 1/z equals (1 + sqrt(5))/2, and we need to find z^85 + 1/z^85. Hmm, complex numbers can sometimes be tricky, especially when dealing with powers. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that expressions like z + 1/z often relate to roots of unity or trigonometric identities. Maybe if I can express z in terms of Euler's formula or something similar, it might help. Alternatively, perhaps there's a recurrence relation or a pattern with the powers of z?

Let me start by letting’s denote w = z + 1/z. Then, according to the problem, w is (1 + sqrt(5))/2. I recall that (1 + sqrt(5))/2 is the golden ratio, often denoted by φ. So, w = φ. Now, I also remember that if z + 1/z = φ, then z^n + 1/z^n can be found using a recursive formula. Maybe I can use that here?

Yes, there's a recurrence relation for such expressions. Let me recall it. If we have z + 1/z = a, then z^n + 1/z^n can be found using the formula:

z^n + 1/z^n = a * (z^{n-1} + 1/z^{n-1}) - (z^{n-2} + 1/z^{n-2})

So, that's a linear recurrence relation. That might be useful. Let me confirm that. Suppose we have z + 1/z = a. Then, multiplying both sides by z^{n-1}, we get z^n + z^{-(n-2)} = a*z^{n-1}. Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Alternatively, maybe using the identity for (z + 1/z)^2 = z^2 + 2 + 1/z^2. So, if we square both sides, we can get z^2 + 1/z^2. Let me try that.

Given z + 1/z = φ, then squaring both sides:

(z + 1/z)^2 = φ^2

z^2 + 2 + 1/z^2 = φ^2

Therefore, z^2 + 1/z^2 = φ^2 - 2

Similarly, to get higher powers, maybe we can compute z^3 + 1/z^3 by multiplying z + 1/z and z^2 + 1/z^2. Let's see:

(z + 1/z)(z^2 + 1/z^2) = z^3 + z + 1/z + 1/z^3 = (z^3 + 1/z^3) + (z + 1/z)

So, rearranging:

z^3 + 1/z^3 = (z + 1/z)(z^2 + 1/z^2) - (z + 1/z)

Substituting the known values:

z^3 + 1/z^3 = φ*(φ^2 - 2) - φ

Hmm, this seems like a pattern. Maybe there's a general recurrence here. Let me formalize this.

Let’s denote a_n = z^n + 1/z^n. Then, we can derive a recurrence relation for a_n.

From the problem, a_1 = φ.

We found that a_2 = φ^2 - 2.

Then, using the identity a_1 * a_2 = a_3 + a_1, as above. Therefore, a_3 = a_1*a_2 - a_1.

Wait, that would be a_3 = a_1*(a_2) - a_0, but a_0 is z^0 + 1/z^0 = 2. Wait, maybe I need to check the exact recurrence.

Let me try multiplying a_1 and a_2:

a_1 * a_2 = (z + 1/z)(z^2 + 1/z^2) = z^3 + z + 1/z + 1/z^3 = a_3 + a_1

Therefore, a_3 = a_1*a_2 - a_1

Similarly, a_4 = a_1*a_3 - a_2

And so on. So, the recurrence is a_n = a_1*a_{n-1} - a_{n-2}

That's a linear recurrence relation of order 2. So, if we can compute the terms up to a_85 using this recurrence, we can find the answer. However, computing up to a_85 manually would be tedious. Maybe there's a pattern or periodicity we can exploit?

Alternatively, perhaps we can find a closed-form expression for a_n. Since it's a linear recurrence relation, we can solve it using characteristic equations.

The recurrence is a_n = a_1*a_{n-1} - a_{n-2}

Let me write the characteristic equation. Suppose the solution is of the form r^n. Then:

r^n = a_1*r^{n-1} - r^{n-2}

Dividing both sides by r^{n-2}:

r^2 = a_1*r - 1

So, the characteristic equation is r^2 - a_1*r + 1 = 0

Solving this quadratic equation:

r = [a_1 ± sqrt(a_1^2 - 4)] / 2

Given that a_1 = φ = (1 + sqrt(5))/2, let's compute the discriminant:

a_1^2 - 4 = [(1 + sqrt(5))/2]^2 - 4

First, compute [(1 + sqrt(5))/2]^2:

= (1 + 2*sqrt(5) + 5)/4

= (6 + 2*sqrt(5))/4

= (3 + sqrt(5))/2

Therefore, a_1^2 - 4 = (3 + sqrt(5))/2 - 4 = (3 + sqrt(5) - 8)/2 = (-5 + sqrt(5))/2

Hmm, discriminant is negative, so the roots are complex. Therefore, the solution will involve complex numbers. So, r = [a_1 ± i*sqrt(4 - a_1^2)] / 2

Wait, but since a_1^2 - 4 is negative, the roots are complex conjugates. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*(r_1)^n + D*(r_2)^n, where r_1 and r_2 are complex conjugates.

But since the roots are complex, we can express the solution in terms of trigonometric functions. Let me recall that for such cases, the solution can be written as a_n = E*cos(nθ) + F*sin(nθ), where θ is the argument of the complex roots.

Alternatively, since the roots are complex conjugates, we can write them as e^{iθ} and e^{-iθ}, where θ is some angle. Then, a_n = K*cos(nθ) + M*sin(nθ). But given the initial conditions, we can find K and M.

Alternatively, maybe there's a simpler approach. Since the problem is about z^n + 1/z^n, and z is a complex number, perhaps z lies on the unit circle? Wait, if z is a complex number such that z + 1/z is a real number (since φ is real), then |z| must be 1. Because if z is not on the unit circle, z + 1/z would have a certain modulus, but here it's given as a real number. So, z must lie on the unit circle, hence |z| = 1, so 1/z is the conjugate of z. Therefore, z is e^{iθ} for some angle θ. Then, z + 1/z = 2*cosθ = φ. So, cosθ = φ/2.

But φ is (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ≈ 1.618/2 ≈ 0.809, which is less than 1, so θ is real, and cosθ = φ/2. Therefore, θ = arccos(φ/2). Let me compute φ/2:

φ/2 = (1 + sqrt(5))/4 ≈ (1 + 2.236)/4 ≈ 0.809, which is indeed positive and less than 1. So, θ is a real angle such that cosθ = φ/2. Therefore, z = e^{iθ}, and 1/z = e^{-iθ}, so z^n + 1/z^n = 2*cos(nθ). Therefore, the expression we need is 2*cos(85θ). So, if we can compute θ, then compute 85θ modulo 2π, and find the cosine of that angle.

But θ = arccos(φ/2). Let me compute θ. Since φ = (1 + sqrt(5))/2, so φ/2 = (1 + sqrt(5))/4. Let me denote cosθ = (1 + sqrt(5))/4. Wait, but (1 + sqrt(5))/4 is approximately (1 + 2.236)/4 ≈ 0.809, which is the value of cos36°, since cos36° ≈ 0.809. Indeed, 36 degrees is π/5 radians. Let me check:

cos(π/5) = cos36° = (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2? Wait, no. Wait, actually cos(36°) is (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 multiplied by 2. Wait, let's recall exact values.

Wait, cos(36°) = (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2, which is (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 * 2 = (sqrt(5) + 1)/2 * (1/2). Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, standard exact value: cos(36°) = (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2. Let me compute (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2 = (1 + sqrt(5))/2. Wait, that's φ. But cos(36°) is approximately 0.809, which is φ/2. Wait, φ is (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ≈ 1.618, so φ/2 ≈ 0.809. Therefore, cos(36°) = φ/2.

Therefore, θ = 36°, which is π/5 radians. Therefore, cosθ = cos(π/5) = φ/2. Therefore, θ = π/5. Therefore, z = e^{iπ/5}. Therefore, z^n + 1/z^n = 2*cos(nπ/5). Therefore, z^85 + 1/z^85 = 2*cos(85π/5) = 2*cos(17π). But 17π is an odd multiple of π, so cos(17π) = cos(π) = -1. Therefore, 2*(-1) = -2. Therefore, the answer is -2. Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me verify this step by step.

First, we have z + 1/z = φ. Then, assuming |z| = 1, which is necessary for z + 1/z to be real. Then, z = e^{iθ}, so 2*cosθ = φ. Therefore, cosθ = φ/2. Since φ = (1 + sqrt(5))/2, then φ/2 = (1 + sqrt(5))/4 ≈ 0.809. And cos(π/5) = (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 * 2? Wait, let's compute cos(π/5):

cos(π/5) = cos36° = (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 * 2. Wait, actually the exact value is (1 + sqrt(5))/4 multiplied by 2. Wait, perhaps I need to recall that cos(π/5) = (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 * 2. Wait, let me compute it correctly.

The exact value of cos(36°) is (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2. Let me check:

cos(36°) = sqrt[(5 + sqrt(5))/8] * 2. Wait, maybe another approach. Let me recall that in a regular pentagon, the diagonal over the side is the golden ratio. So, maybe trigonometric identities can help.

Alternatively, let's compute cos(π/5):

cos(π/5) = cos36° ≈ 0.8090, which is equal to (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 * 2. Wait, (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 ≈ (2.236 + 1)/4 ≈ 3.236/4 ≈ 0.809. Therefore, cos(π/5) = (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 * 2? Wait, no. Wait, (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 is approximately 0.809, so cos(π/5) = (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 * 2? Wait, that would be (sqrt(5) + 1)/2 ≈ 1.618, which is φ. Wait, no. Wait, cos(π/5) is equal to (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 * 2? Wait, maybe I'm confused.

Wait, let's compute:

sqrt(5) ≈ 2.236

So, sqrt(5) + 1 ≈ 3.236

Divide by 4: ≈ 0.809

Therefore, (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 ≈ 0.809, which is equal to cos(π/5). Therefore, cos(π/5) = (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 * 2? Wait, no. Wait, (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 is approximately 0.809, which is equal to cos(π/5). Therefore, cos(π/5) = (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 * 2. Wait, no. Wait, let's square both sides. Wait, perhaps not necessary.

But in any case, since cos(π/5) ≈ 0.809, which is equal to φ/2, then θ = π/5. Therefore, z = e^{iπ/5}, so z^85 = e^{i85π/5} = e^{i17π} = e^{iπ}^{17} = (e^{iπ})^{17} = (-1)^{17} = -1. Therefore, z^85 + 1/z^85 = (-1) + (-1) = -2. Therefore, the answer is -2.

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if this is correct. Let me verify step by step.

First, we have z + 1/z = φ. Then, assuming |z| = 1, so z = e^{iθ}, so 2cosθ = φ. Therefore, cosθ = φ/2. Since φ = (1 + sqrt(5))/2, then φ/2 = (1 + sqrt(5))/4 ≈ 0.809. Then, θ = arccos(φ/2) = π/5. Therefore, z = e^{iπ/5}, so z^85 = e^{i85π/5} = e^{i17π} = e^{iπ *17} = (e^{iπ})^{17} = (-1)^17 = -1. Therefore, 1/z^85 = e^{-i85π/5} = e^{-i17π} = (-1)^{-17} = -1. Therefore, z^85 + 1/z^85 = -1 + (-1) = -2. That seems correct. Therefore, the answer is -2.

But let me check if there's an alternative approach, maybe using the recurrence relation. Let's see. If we use the recurrence relation a_n = a_1*a_{n-1} - a_{n-2}, with a_1 = φ, a_2 = φ^2 - 2, then compute a_3, a_4, etc., up to a_85. However, calculating up to a_85 manually would be tedious. But perhaps we can notice a periodicity in the sequence.

Alternatively, since we have z = e^{iπ/5}, then z^5 = e^{iπ} = -1, so z^5 = -1. Therefore, z^5 = -1, so z^5 + 1/z^5 = -1 + (-1) = -2, which is a_5 = -2. Then, z^10 = (z^5)^2 = (-1)^2 = 1, so a_10 = 1 + 1 = 2. Then, z^15 = (z^5)^3 = (-1)^3 = -1, so a_15 = -2. Similarly, z^20 = 1, a_20 = 2. So, the sequence a_n alternates between -2 and 2 every 5 terms. Therefore, a_5 = -2, a_10 = 2, a_15 = -2, a_20 = 2, etc. Therefore, for n divisible by 5, a_n = (-1)^{n/5 + 1}. Wait, let's check.

Wait, n=5: a_5 = -2 = (-1)^{1 +1} = 1? No. Wait, maybe a_n = (-1)^{k} where k = n/5. Wait, n=5: k=1, a_5=-2; n=10: k=2, a_10=2; n=15: k=3, a_15=-2; n=20: k=4, a_20=2. So, a_n = (-1)^k * 2, where k = n/5. Therefore, a_n = (-1)^{n/5} * 2. Wait, but n=5: (-1)^1 *2 = -2, which matches. n=10: (-1)^2 *2=2, matches. n=15: (-1)^3 *2=-2, matches. So, this seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = 2*(-1)^{n/5} when n is divisible by 5.

Therefore, for n=85, which is 5*17, so k=17. Therefore, a_85 = 2*(-1)^17 = -2. Therefore, the answer is -2. That matches the previous result.

Therefore, both methods lead to the same answer. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{-2}.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{-2}
Therefore, the value of \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \) is \boxed{-2}.
