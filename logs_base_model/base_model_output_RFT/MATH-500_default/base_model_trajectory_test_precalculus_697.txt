Okay, so I need to simplify the expression tan 100° + 4 sin 100°. Hmm, let's start by recalling some trigonometric identities that might help here. I know that tan θ is equal to sin θ over cos θ, so maybe rewriting tan 100° as sin 100°/cos 100° could be useful. Let me try that.

So, tan 100° + 4 sin 100° becomes (sin 100°/cos 100°) + 4 sin 100°. Maybe I can factor out sin 100° from both terms? Let's see:

sin 100° (1/cos 100° + 4). Hmm, that's sin 100° times (sec 100° + 4). But I don't know if that helps. Maybe there's another identity or a way to combine these terms into a single trigonometric function?

Alternatively, perhaps using the sine addition formula? Let me think. The expression is in terms of sin and tan, which is sin over cos. Maybe if I can express everything in terms of sine and cosine, I can find a common denominator or something. Let's try that.

So, tan 100° is sin 100°/cos 100°, so the expression becomes (sin 100°/cos 100°) + 4 sin 100°. Let's combine these terms:

First term: sin 100°/cos 100°
Second term: 4 sin 100°, which can be written as (4 sin 100° cos 100°)/cos 100°, so that both terms have the same denominator.

So combining them: [sin 100° + 4 sin 100° cos 100°]/cos 100°. Factor out sin 100° from the numerator:

sin 100° (1 + 4 cos 100°)/cos 100°. Hmm, so that's sin 100° times (1 + 4 cos 100°) divided by cos 100°. Maybe this can be simplified further?

Alternatively, perhaps use the identity for sin A cos B? Let me check. The expression 4 sin 100° cos 100° is equal to 2 sin 200°, since sin 2A = 2 sin A cos A. So, 4 sin 100° cos 100° = 2 sin 200°. Let me write that down:

Original expression: tan 100° + 4 sin 100° = sin 100°/cos 100° + 4 sin 100°
Convert to same denominator: sin 100° (1 + 4 cos 100°)/cos 100°
But 4 cos 100° = 2 * 2 cos 100°, and maybe use some double angle identity?

Wait, maybe instead of that, let's consider that 100° is an angle in the second quadrant where sine is positive and cosine is negative. So cos 100° is negative, which might complicate things. Let's note that cos 100° = -cos(80°), because cos(180° - θ) = -cos θ. Similarly, sin 100° = sin(80°), since sin(180° - θ) = sin θ.

So maybe substituting these in:

tan 100° = sin 100°/cos 100° = sin 80°/(-cos 80°) = -tan 80°

So the original expression becomes -tan 80° + 4 sin 80°. Hmm, that might be helpful. So now we have -tan 80° + 4 sin 80°. Let's write that as 4 sin 80° - tan 80°.

Let me write tan 80° as sin 80°/cos 80°, so the expression is 4 sin 80° - sin 80°/cos 80°. Let's factor out sin 80° again:

sin 80° (4 - 1/cos 80°). Hmm, 4 - 1/cos 80°. Let's compute 1/cos 80°, which is sec 80°. But I don't see an immediate identity here. Maybe express 4 as 4 sec 80° / sec 80°, so that we can combine terms?

Wait, 4 - 1/cos 80° = (4 cos 80° - 1)/cos 80°. So then the expression becomes sin 80° * (4 cos 80° - 1)/cos 80°. Which is sin 80° (4 cos 80° - 1)/cos 80°. Hmm, not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, maybe use the sine addition formula on 4 sin 80° - tan 80°. Let's think. Let me write it as 4 sin 80° - (sin 80°/cos 80°). Maybe factor sin 80°:

sin 80° (4 - 1/cos 80°). Wait, that's where we were before. Maybe instead, let's try to write this as a single sine or cosine function. Let's see:

Suppose we have 4 sin 80° - tan 80°. Let me try to express this as A sin 80° + B cos 80°, but since tan 80° is sin 80°/cos 80°, it's not straightforward. Alternatively, maybe use the identity for a linear combination of sine and cosine.

Alternatively, let's consider multiplying numerator and denominator by something. Wait, perhaps express everything in terms of sine and cosine:

So, 4 sin 80° - tan 80° = 4 sin 80° - sin 80°/cos 80°. Let's combine them:

[4 sin 80° cos 80° - sin 80°] / cos 80°. Factor sin 80° in the numerator:

sin 80° [4 cos 80° - 1] / cos 80°. Hmm, same as before.

Alternatively, maybe use the identity for sin(A - B) or something. Let me think. Let's see, 4 cos 80° - 1. Maybe write 4 cos 80° as 2 * 2 cos 80°, but not sure. Alternatively, perhaps use the identity for cos(A - B) or cos(A + B). Let me check:

cos(A - B) = cos A cos B + sin A sin B
cos(A + B) = cos A cos B - sin A sin B

But I don't see a direct connection here. Wait, let's compute 4 cos 80° - 1. Let me calculate the numerical value to see if it relates to some angle.

But maybe that's not the way to go. Alternatively, perhaps use the fact that 80° is 30° + 50°, but not sure. Alternatively, use the cosine of 20°, since 80° is 4 times 20°, but not sure.

Alternatively, maybe use the identity for multiple angles. Wait, 80° is 180° - 100°, but that's where we came from. Maybe another approach.

Wait, perhaps using the identity for sin 3θ or something? Let's see. For example, sin 3θ = 3 sin θ - 4 sin³ θ. But not sure if that applies here.

Alternatively, maybe consider that 4 sin 80° - tan 80° can be rewritten as 4 sin 80° - sin 80°/cos 80°. Let me factor sin 80°:

sin 80° (4 - 1/cos 80°). Let's compute 4 - sec 80°. Since cos 80° is approximately 0.1736, so sec 80° is approximately 5.7588. So 4 - 5.7588 ≈ -1.7588. So sin 80° is about 0.9848, so multiplying gives approximately 0.9848 * (-1.7588) ≈ -1.732. Wait, that's roughly -√3, which is approximately -1.732. So maybe the expression simplifies to -√3? Let me check.

But let's verify this numerically. Let's compute tan 100° + 4 sin 100°.

First, compute tan 100°. 100° is in the second quadrant, so tan 100° = tan(180° - 80°) = -tan 80°. So tan 80° ≈ 5.671, so tan 100° ≈ -5.671.

4 sin 100°. Sin 100° ≈ sin 80° ≈ 0.9848, so 4 * 0.9848 ≈ 3.9392.

So tan 100° + 4 sin 100° ≈ -5.671 + 3.9392 ≈ -1.7318. Which is approximately -√3, since √3 ≈ 1.732. So that's close. So maybe the exact value is -√3. If that's the case, then the simplified expression is -√3. Let's see if we can prove that analytically.

So, if the expression is equal to -√3, then tan 100° + 4 sin 100° = -√3. Let's check if this identity holds.

We can write tan 100° + 4 sin 100° = sin 100°/cos 100° + 4 sin 100°. Let's factor sin 100°:

sin 100° (1/cos 100° + 4). Let's compute 1/cos 100° + 4. Since cos 100° = -cos 80°, so 1/cos 100° = -1/cos 80°. Therefore:

sin 100° (-1/cos 80° + 4) = sin 80° (-1/cos 80° + 4) because sin 100° = sin 80°. Therefore:

sin 80° (4 - 1/cos 80°). Let's compute this expression:

4 - 1/cos 80° = 4 - sec 80°. Let's see if this equals -√3 / sin 80°. Wait, maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, let's compute 4 - sec 80°. Let's compute sec 80° = 1/cos 80° ≈ 5.7588, so 4 - 5.7588 ≈ -1.7588. Then multiply by sin 80° ≈ 0.9848:

-1.7588 * 0.9848 ≈ -1.732, which is -√3. So it's exact. Therefore, the expression simplifies to -√3. But how can we prove this analytically?

Let me think. Let's set the expression equal to -√3 and see if the identity holds. So:

tan 100° + 4 sin 100° = -√3

Express tan 100° as -tan 80°:

-tan 80° + 4 sin 80° = -√3

Rearranged:

4 sin 80° - tan 80° = -√3

Multiply both sides by cos 80° to eliminate the denominator:

4 sin 80° cos 80° - sin 80° = -√3 cos 80°

Compute 4 sin 80° cos 80°, which is 2 sin 160°, since sin 2θ = 2 sin θ cos θ. So 4 sin 80° cos 80° = 2 sin 160°. Sin 160° is sin(180° - 20°) = sin 20° ≈ 0.3420. So 2 sin 160° ≈ 0.6840.

Then left side: 0.6840 - sin 80° ≈ 0.6840 - 0.9848 ≈ -0.3008.

Right side: -√3 cos 80° ≈ -1.732 * 0.1736 ≈ -0.3008. So numerically, both sides are equal. Therefore, the identity holds. Therefore, tan 100° + 4 sin 100° = -√3.

So the simplified form is -√3. Therefore, the answer is -√3. But let me check again the steps to ensure there's no mistake.

Wait, let's verify the algebraic steps again. Starting from:

4 sin 80° - tan 80° = -√3

Multiply both sides by cos 80°:

4 sin 80° cos 80° - sin 80° = -√3 cos 80°

Left side: 4 sin 80° cos 80° is 2 sin 160°, so 2 sin 160° - sin 80°. Since sin 160° = sin 20°, so 2 sin 20° - sin 80°. Let's compute 2 sin 20° - sin 80°.

Using exact values: sin 20° ≈ 0.3420, sin 80° ≈ 0.9848. So 2*0.3420 = 0.6840 - 0.9848 ≈ -0.3008.

Right side: -√3 cos 80° ≈ -1.732 * 0.1736 ≈ -0.3008. So they are equal numerically. Therefore, the identity holds, so the original expression is indeed equal to -√3.

Therefore, the simplified form of tan 100° + 4 sin 100° is -√3. So the final answer should be \boxed{-\sqrt{3}}.
Therefore, the simplified form of $\tan 100^\circ + 4 \sin 100^\circ$ is $\boxed{-\sqrt{3}}$.
