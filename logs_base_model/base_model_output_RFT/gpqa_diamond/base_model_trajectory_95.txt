Okay, so I need to find the entropy of a supermassive black hole given its angular size and distance. Let me start by recalling what I know about black holes and entropy.

First, entropy of a black hole is related to its area. The formula I remember is S = (A c^3)/(4 G ħ k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon. But maybe there's a simpler version using more familiar constants. Oh right, sometimes they use S = (k_B c^3)/(G ħ) * (A/4), but I think the standard formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 G ħ k_B). Wait, actually, I think the correct formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 G ħ k_B), but I need to check the units to make sure. Alternatively, there's a version where entropy is proportional to the area divided by the Planck area. The Planck area is G ħ / c^3. Wait, actually, the area in terms of Planck units would be A/(G ħ/c^4)^(1/2) but I might be mixing up the exponents here. Let me think again.

The entropy formula in terms of the area is S = (A c^3)/(4 G ħ k_B). Alternatively, I've also heard that the entropy is proportional to the area divided by the Planck area multiplied by the Boltzmann constant. Wait, the Planck area is G ħ / c^3, right? So the Planck area is Għ c^−3. Therefore, the number of Planck areas in the horizon area would be A/(G ħ / c^3) = (A c^3)/(G ħ). Then multiply by the Boltzmann constant to get entropy? Wait, maybe the formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 G ħ) * (1/k_B). Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me look up the correct formula again in my mind. Oh right, the correct formula is S = (c^3 A)/(4 G ħ k_B). Wait, but I think sometimes the formula is written as S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 G ħ). Wait, maybe the standard formula is S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G). Let me confirm. The standard Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is S = (A c^3)/(4 G ħ) * (1/(k_B)). Wait, actually, I'm getting conflicting versions here. Let me try to recall the exact formula.

The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula is S = (k_B c^3)/(4 ħ G) * A. Wait, that seems right. Because the area A has units of m². Let's check the units. The entropy S should have units of J/K. Let's see: (k_B has units J/K), c is m/s, ħ is J·s, G is m³/(kg s²). So let's compute the units of (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G). Let's compute numerator: k_B (J/K) * c^3 (m³/s³) * A (m²) = (J/K) * m³/s³ * m² = J m^5 / (K s³). Denominator: ħ G (J s * m³/(kg s²)) = J m³/(kg s). So denominator is J m³/(kg s). So overall units: (J m^5 / (K s³)) / (J m³/(kg s)) ) = (m^5 / K s³) * (kg s / J m³) * J cancels. Wait, let's compute step by step. Numerator units: (J/K) * (m^3/s^3) * m^2 = J m^5 / (K s^3). Denominator: (J s) * (m^3/(kg s^2)) ) = J m^3/(kg s). So the entire fraction is [J m^5/(K s^3)] / [J m^3/(kg s)] = (m^5 kg s) / (K s^3 m^3) ) = (kg m^2)/(K s^2). But entropy should have units of J/K, which is kg m²/(s² K). So the units match. Therefore, the formula S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G) gives the correct units. So the correct formula is S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G).

Alternatively, some sources write it as S = (A c^3)/(4 G ħ) * (1/k_B), but that would give the wrong units. Wait, no, because if we have S = (A c^3)/(4 G ħ k_B), then the units would be (m² (m/s)^3 ) / (m³/(kg s²) * J s * K). Wait, this is getting too confusing. Let me instead rely on the standard formula. The standard entropy of a black hole is S = (k_B c^3)/(4 ħ G) * A. So that's the correct formula. So S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G). That's the formula I should use.

So the first step is to find the area A of the event horizon. The event horizon of a black hole is a sphere with radius equal to the Schwarzschild radius, which is R_s = 2 G M / c^2. So the area A is 4 π R_s² = 4 π (2 G M / c^2)^2 = 16 π G² M² / c^4.

Alternatively, since A = 4 π R², where R is the Schwarzschild radius. So A = 4 π (2 G M / c²)^2 = 16 π G² M² / c^4. So if I can find the mass M of the black hole, I can compute the area A and then the entropy S.

But the problem gives me the angular size θ and the distance d. The angular size θ is the apparent size of the event horizon as seen from Earth. The formula for the angular size is θ ≈ 2 R / d, where R is the radius of the object, and d is the distance. But wait, that's an approximation for small angles. The exact formula is θ = 2 R / d, but actually, the exact formula for small angles is θ ≈ (2 R)/d, where θ is in radians. So if θ is small, we can use that approximation.

Given θ in radians, so θ (rad) ≈ 2 R / d. Solving for R: R ≈ θ d / 2. Then, since R = 2 G M / c², we can solve for M: M = (R c²)/(2 G) = (θ d c²)/(4 G).

Once we have M, we can compute the area A = 4 π R² = 4 π (2 G M / c²)^2. Let's substitute M into this equation.

A = 4 π (2 G (θ d c²)/(4 G) / c² )². Wait, let me compute step by step.

First, R = θ d / 2. Then R = 2 G M / c² => M = R c²/(2 G) = (θ d / 2) c²/(2 G) = θ d c²/(4 G).

Then, A = 4 π R² = 4 π (θ d / 2)^2 = 4 π θ² d² /4 = π θ² d².

Wait, that's interesting. Because substituting M into A gives A = 4 π R², and R is θ d / 2, so R² is θ² d² /4, so A = 4 π * θ² d² /4 = π θ² d². Therefore, the area A is π θ² d². But wait, this seems too simplified. Let me check the algebra again.

Yes, R = θ d / 2. Then R² = (θ d / 2)^2 = θ² d² /4. Then A = 4 π R² = 4 π * (θ² d² /4) = π θ² d². So that's correct. Therefore, the area A is π θ² d². That's a neat result. So A = π θ² d².

But wait, this is only valid if the angular size is small, which it is here, since θ is 10^-17 degrees. Let me convert θ into radians to check the approximation. 1 degree is π/180 radians. So θ = 10^-17 degrees * π/180 radians/degree ≈ (π/180) * 10^-17 radians. So θ ≈ 1.745 × 10^-19 radians. Since this is a very small angle, the approximation θ ≈ 2 R / d is valid. So the formula A = π θ² d² is correct.

Therefore, to find the entropy S, we can use S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G). Substituting A = π θ² d² into the formula:

S = (k_B c^3 π θ² d²)/(4 ħ G).

Now, we need to compute this expression. Let's plug in the values.

Given:
θ = 10^-17 degrees. We need to convert this to radians for the calculation. So θ_rad = θ_deg * π/180 ≈ 10^-17 * 0.0174533 ≈ 1.74533 × 10^-19 radians.

d = 10^10 parsecs. Wait, parsecs need to be converted into meters. 1 parsec is approximately 3.0857 × 10^16 meters. So d = 10^10 parsecs = 10^10 * 3.0857 × 10^16 m = 3.0857 × 10^26 m.

c is the speed of light, approximately 3 × 10^8 m/s.

G is the gravitational constant, approximately 6.674 × 10^-11 m³ kg^-1 s^-2.

ħ is the reduced Planck constant, approximately 1.05457 × 10^-34 J s.

k_B is the Boltzmann constant, approximately 1.3806 × 10^-23 J/K.

Let me write down all the values:

θ_rad ≈ 1.74533 × 10^-19 radians

d = 3.0857 × 10^26 meters

c = 3 × 10^8 m/s

G = 6.674 × 10^-11 m³ kg^-1 s^-2

ħ = 1.05457 × 10^-34 J s

k_B = 1.3806 × 10^-23 J/K

Now, plug these into the formula S = (k_B c^3 π θ² d²)/(4 ħ G).

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute θ²:

θ² = (1.74533 × 10^-19)^2 ≈ (3.046 × 10^-38) radians².

Then, compute d²:

d² = (3.0857 × 10^26)^2 ≈ 9.52 × 10^52 m².

Multiply θ² and d²:

θ² d² ≈ 3.046 × 10^-38 * 9.52 × 10^52 ≈ 2.898 × 10^15 (since 10^-38 * 10^52 = 10^14, and 3.046 * 9.52 ≈ 28.98, so 28.98 × 10^14 ≈ 2.898 × 10^15).

Next, calculate c^3:

c^3 = (3 × 10^8)^3 = 27 × 10^24 = 2.7 × 10^25 m³/s³.

Multiply by θ² d²:

c^3 θ² d² ≈ 2.7 × 10^25 * 2.898 × 10^15 ≈ 7.8246 × 10^40.

Multiply by π:

π ≈ 3.1416, so 7.8246 × 10^40 * 3.1416 ≈ 2.458 × 10^41.

Now, multiply by k_B:

k_B ≈ 1.3806 × 10^-23 J/K, so 2.458 × 10^41 * 1.3806 × 10^-23 ≈ 3.396 × 10^18 J/K.

Now, divide by (4 ħ G):

First, compute 4 ħ G:

4 * 1.05457 × 10^-34 J s * 6.674 × 10^-11 m³ kg^-1 s^-2.

Compute the product:

1.05457 × 6.674 ≈ 7.042 (since 1.05 * 6.67 ≈ 7.00). So 7.042 × 10^-34 * 10^-11 = 7.042 × 10^-45 J m³ kg^-1 s^-1.

Multiply by 4:

4 * 7.042 × 10^-45 ≈ 2.817 × 10^-44 J m³ kg^-1 s^-1.

Wait, but the units here need to be checked. Let me make sure.

Wait, 4 ħ G has units of (J s) * (m³ kg^-1 s^-2) ) = J m³ s^-1 kg^-1. But to get the denominator, we need to compute 4 ħ G. So 4 ħ G = 4 * ħ * G. So the numerical value is 4 * 1.05457e-34 * 6.674e-11 ≈ 4 * 7.04e-45 ≈ 2.817e-44. The units would be (J s) * (m³ kg^-1 s^-2) ) = J m³ s^-1 kg^-1. But when we divide by this in the entropy formula, which is S = numerator / denominator, where denominator is 4 ħ G. So in terms of units, that's correct.

So now, the division step: 3.396 × 10^18 J/K divided by 2.817 × 10^-44 J m³ kg^-1 s^-1. Wait, but the denominator is in J m³ kg^-1 s^-1. Wait, no, the denominator is 4 ħ G, which has units of (J s)(m³ kg^-1 s^-2) ) = J m³ s^-1 kg^-1. So when we divide by 4 ħ G, the units become (J/K) / (J m³ s^-1 kg^-1) ) = kg^-1 s^2 m^-3 K^-1. Wait, but entropy should have units of J/K. So this seems inconsistent. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, let me check the formula again. The formula is S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G). So the denominator is 4 ħ G, which has units (J s)(m³ kg^-1 s^-2) ) = J m³ s^-1 kg^-1. So S has units (J/K) * m³ s^-1 kg^-1 / (m³ s^-1 kg^-1) )? Wait, no. Let me compute the units step by step.

The numerator is k_B c^3 A. k_B is J/K, c^3 is (m/s)^3 = m³/s³, A is m². So numerator units: (J/K) * (m³/s³) * m² = J m^5 / (K s³). Denominator is 4 ħ G. ħ is J s, G is m³ kg^-1 s^-2. So denominator units: J s * m³ kg^-1 s^-2 = J m³ kg^-1 s^-1. So overall units: (J m^5 / K s³) / (J m³ kg^-1 s^-1) ) = (m^5 / K s³) * (kg s / J m³) * J cancels. Wait, let's compute it properly:

Numerator: J m^5 / (K s³)

Denominator: J m³ / (kg s)

So dividing numerator by denominator: (J m^5 / K s³) / (J m³ / kg s) ) = (m^5 kg s) / (K s³ m³) ) = (kg m²) / (K s²). But entropy S has units J/K = kg m² / (s² K). So the units match. Therefore, the calculation is correct.

So back to the calculation: 3.396e18 J/K divided by 2.817e-44 J m³ kg^-1 s^-1. Wait, but the denominator is in J m³ kg^-1 s^-1, and the numerator is in J/K. So when we divide, the units become (J/K) / (J m³ kg^-1 s^-1) ) = (1/K) * (kg s / m³). But this doesn't match the required units. Hmm, perhaps I messed up the denominator.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check again. The formula is S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G). So the denominator is 4 ħ G. Let me compute 4 ħ G numerically.

4 * ħ * G = 4 * 1.05457e-34 * 6.674e-11

First, multiply 1.05457e-34 * 6.674e-11:

1.05457 * 6.674 ≈ 7.042 (as before). Then 10^-34 * 10^-11 = 10^-45. So 7.042e-45. Multiply by 4: 28.17e-45 = 2.817e-44. So denominator is 2.817e-44 J m³ kg^-1 s^-1.

But in the entropy formula, it's S = (numerator) / (denominator) = (k_B c^3 A) / (4 ħ G). So the denominator is 4 ħ G, which is 2.817e-44 J m³ kg^-1 s^-1.

But when we compute S, it's (3.396e18 J/K) / (2.817e-44 J m³ kg^-1 s^-1). Wait, but the denominator has units J m³ kg^-1 s^-1. So dividing J/K by J m³ kg^-1 s^-1 gives (1/K) * kg s / m³. But entropy should be in J/K. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my calculation. Let me check where.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula. Let me re-express the formula. The correct formula is S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G). Let me write all the units again to check:

k_B: J/K

c^3: (m/s)^3 = m³/s³

A: m²

So numerator: (J/K) * (m³/s³) * m² = J m^5 / (K s³)

Denominator: 4 ħ G: J s * m³/(kg s²) ) = J m³/(kg s)

So denominator: J m³/(kg s)

Therefore, S = (J m^5 / (K s³)) / (J m³/(kg s)) ) = (m^5 kg s) / (K s³ m³) ) = (kg m²)/(K s²) = J/K. Correct.

So the units are correct. Now, the numerical calculation:

Numerator after all steps was 3.396e18 J/K.

Denominator: 4 ħ G = 2.817e-44 J m³ kg^-1 s^-1.

So S = 3.396e18 / 2.817e-44 ≈ 1.206e62 J/K.

Wait, 3.396e18 divided by 2.817e-44 is 3.396e18 / 2.817e-44 = (3.396 / 2.817) * 10^(18 - (-44)) = approx 1.206 * 10^62.

So S ≈ 1.2e62 J/K. Looking at the options, option A is 10^62 J/K, option B is 10^66, etc. So the closest is option A. However, let me check my calculations again because the exponent seems a bit low. Wait, but the options are all powers of 10, so perhaps the approximation is sufficient.

But wait, let's verify the steps again. The key steps are:

1. Compute A = π θ² d².

2. Plug into S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G).

3. Numerically compute each term.

Wait, in the calculation above, when I computed θ² d², I got θ² ≈ 3.046e-38, d² ≈ 9.52e52, so θ² d² ≈ 2.898e15. Then c^3 is 2.7e25, so c^3 θ² d² ≈ 7.824e40. Multiply by π: ~2.458e41. Multiply by k_B: 2.458e41 * 1.38e-23 ≈ 3.396e18. Then divide by 4 ħ G: 2.817e-44. So 3.396e18 / 2.817e-44 ≈ 1.206e62.

But wait, the options are A: 1e62, B:1e66, C:1e59, D:1e65. So 1.2e62 is closest to option A (1e62). However, let me check if I missed any factors in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of θ² d². Let me recompute θ² d²:

θ_rad = 1.745e-19 radians

d = 3.0857e26 m

θ² = (1.745e-19)^2 ≈ 3.046e-38 rad²

d² = (3.0857e26)^2 ≈ 9.522e52 m²

θ² d² = 3.046e-38 * 9.522e52 ≈ 2.898e15 m² rad². Wait, but radians are dimensionless, so θ² d² is in m². Then c^3 is in m³/s³. So c^3 θ² d² is (m³/s³) * m² = m^5/s³. Then multiplied by π: m^5/s³. Then multiplied by k_B (J/K = m² kg/s² K): m^5/s³ * m² kg/s² / K = m^7 kg / (s^5 K). Then divided by 4 ħ G (which is J s m³ kg^-1 s^-2 = m^3 kg s^-1). So units: (m^7 kg / s^5 K) / (m^3 kg s^-1) ) = m^4 / (s^4 K). But entropy should be J/K = m^2 kg/(s^2 K). So this suggests an error in the units. Wait, but earlier I thought the units matched, but now this seems off. Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula. Let me check the formula again.

Wait, the formula is S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G). Let's compute the units again:

k_B: J/K = m² kg/(s² K)

c^3: (m/s)^3 = m³/s³

A: m²

So numerator: (m² kg/(s² K)) * (m³/s³) * m² = m^7 kg / (s^5 K)

Denominator: 4 ħ G = 4 * (J s) * (m³ kg^-1 s^-2) ) = 4 * (m² kg s) * (m³ kg^-1 s^-2) ) = 4 * m^5 / s

So denominator units: m^5 / s

Therefore, S units: (m^7 kg / (s^5 K)) / (m^5 / s) ) = m^2 kg / (s^4 K). But entropy should be J/K = m² kg/(s² K). Therefore, there's a discrepancy here. This suggests that the formula I used has incorrect units, which can't be right. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G k_B)? No, that would bring in another k_B. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G) * (k_B / ...). Wait, I think I need to check the correct formula for entropy of a black hole.

Upon checking, the correct formula is indeed S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G). But let's verify the dimensions again. Let me look up the units.

The entropy of a black hole is given by S = (k_B c^3)/(4 ħ G) * A. So the formula is correct. Let me check the units again. Let's use the units:

c^3: m³/s³

A: m²

k_B: J/K = m² kg/(s² K)

ħ: J s = m² kg/(s)

G: m³ kg^-1 s^-2

So (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G):

(k_B c^3 A) = (m² kg/(s² K)) * (m³/s³) * m² = m^7 kg/(s^5 K)

(4 ħ G) = 4 * (m² kg/s) * (m³ kg^-1 s^-2) ) = 4 * m^5 / s^3

Therefore, (m^7 kg/(s^5 K)) / (m^5 / s^3) ) = (m² kg)/(s² K) = J/K. Yes, the units are correct. So my earlier calculation was correct. Therefore, the entropy S is approximately 1.2e62 J/K. But the options are A:1e62, D:1e65, etc. So the closest is option A. But wait, let me check the calculation again.

Wait, in the calculation, after computing k_B c^3 θ² d² π, I got 3.396e18 J/K. Then dividing by 4 ħ G (2.817e-44), which gives 3.396e18 / 2.817e-44 ≈ 1.206e62. So approximately 1.2e62 J/K. So the correct answer should be A:1e62 J/K. But let me check the problem again. The problem says the entropy of the black hole.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check the formula again. The standard formula for the entropy of a black hole is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G) * (k_B / (something)). Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 8π or something. Let me recall that the area of the event horizon is A = 16 π G² M² / c^4. Then the entropy is S = (k_B c^3)/(4 ħ G) * A. So substituting A:

S = (k_B c^3)/(4 ħ G) * (16 π G² M² / c^4) ) = (k_B c^3 * 16 π G² M² )/(4 ħ G c^4) ) = (4 π k_B G M²)/(ħ c). Wait, that seems different. Wait, that's the standard formula for entropy in terms of mass. Let me check:

Yes, the entropy can also be written as S = (A c)/(4 l_p^2) * k_B, where l_p is the Planck length. Since l_p = sqrt(ħ G / c^3). Let's compute l_p^2 = ħ G / c^3. Then A/(4 l_p^2) = A/(4 ħ G / c^3) ) = A c^3/(4 ħ G). So yes, that's consistent with the previous formula.

Therefore, the formula S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G) is correct. Therefore, the calculation is correct, leading to approximately 1.2e62 J/K. So the answer should be A:1e62 J/K.

But wait, let me check the exact calculation again. Let's redo the numerical steps with more precision.

First, compute θ in radians: θ = 10^-17 degrees. θ_rad = 10^-17 * π/180 ≈ 1.74532925 × 10^-19 radians.

d = 10^10 parsecs = 10^10 * 3.08567758e16 m ≈ 3.08567758e26 m.

Compute θ²: (1.74532925e-19)^2 ≈ 3.046183e-38 rad².

d²: (3.08567758e26)^2 ≈ 9.522276e52 m².

θ² d²: 3.046183e-38 * 9.522276e52 ≈ 2.89775e15 m² rad².

Multiply by π: 2.89775e15 * 3.14159265 ≈ 9.117e15 m² rad².

Multiply by c^3: (3e8 m/s)^3 = 27e24 m³/s³ = 2.7e25 m³/s³.

c^3 * θ² d² * π ≈ 2.7e25 * 9.117e15 ≈ 2.7e25 * 9.117e15 = 2.7 * 9.117 = 24.6159e40 = 2.46159e41 m³/s³ * m² rad².

Multiply by k_B: 1.380649e-23 J/K.

So 2.46159e41 * 1.380649e-23 ≈ 2.46159 * 1.380649 ≈ 3.384e18 J/(s³ m³ rad²) * m² rad² = 3.384e18 J s³ m⁻¹.

Wait, no, wait. Let me check the units again. c^3 has units m³/s³, θ² d² is m² rad², multiplied by π is still m² rad². Then multiplied by c^3 gives m^5/s³. Then multiplied by k_B (J/K = m² kg/(s² K)). So units: m^5/s³ * m² kg/(s² K) = m^7 kg/(s^5 K). Then divide by 4 ħ G (units m^5/s). So m^7 kg/(s^5 K) / m^5/s = m^2 kg/(s^4 K) → but J/K is m² kg/(s² K), so there's a discrepancy. Wait, this suggests that the units are incorrect. There's a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula. Let me check the formula again. The correct entropy formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G) * k_B. Wait, no. Let me check a reliable source. According to the Wikipedia page on black hole thermodynamics, the entropy of a Schwarzschild (non-rotating) black hole is given by:

S = (k_B c^3)/(4 ħ G) * A.

But when I check the units here:

A (area) is m².

c^3 is m³/s³.

ħ is J s = m² kg/s.

G is m³ kg^-1 s^-2.

So (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G):

(k_B: J/K = m² kg/(s² K)) * (c^3: m³/s³) * (A: m²) ) = m^7 kg/(s^5 K)

Denominator: 4 ħ G = 4 * (m² kg/s) * (m³ kg^-1 s^-2) ) = 4 * m^5 / s³

So total units: (m^7 kg/(s^5 K)) / (m^5/s³) ) = (m² kg)/(s² K) = J/K. Correct. So the units are correct.

Therefore, the calculation is correct, leading to S ≈ 1.2e62 J/K. But the options are A:1e62, D:1e65. So the closest is option A. However, let me check if the constants were used correctly.

Wait, let's recalculate the numerical value more precisely.

Compute S = (k_B c^3 π θ² d²)/(4 ħ G)

Let's compute each term step by step:

1. Compute π θ² d²:

θ = 1e-17 degrees → θ_rad = π/180 * 1e-17 ≈ 1.74532925e-19 rad.

θ² = (1.74532925e-19)^2 ≈ 3.046183e-38 rad².

d = 10^10 parsecs → d = 10^10 * 3.08567758e16 m ≈ 3.08567758e26 m.

d² = (3.08567758e26)^2 ≈ 9.522276e52 m².

θ² * d² = 3.046183e-38 * 9.522276e52 ≈ 2.89775e15 m² rad².

Multiply by π: 2.89775e15 * π ≈ 9.117e15 m² rad².

Multiply by c^3: c = 3e8 m/s → c^3 = 27e24 m³/s³ = 2.7e25 m³/s³.

9.117e15 * 2.7e25 = 2.46159e41 m³/s³ * m² rad² = 2.46159e41 m^5/s³ rad².

Multiply by k_B: k_B = 1.380649e-23 J/K = 1.380649e-23 m² kg/(s² K).

2.46159e41 * 1.380649e-23 = (2.46159 * 1.380649) * 1e18 ≈ 3.384e18 J/(s³) * m² rad².

Divide by 4 ħ G:

4 ħ G = 4 * 1.0545718e-34 J s * 6.67430e-11 m³ kg^-1 s^-2.

Compute ħ G: 1.0545718e-34 * 6.67430e-11 ≈ 7.043e-45 J m³ kg^-1 s^-1.

4 ħ G ≈ 2.817e-44 J m³ kg^-1 s^-1.

So 3.384e18 / 2.817e-44 ≈ 1.204e62 J/K.

So approximately 1.2e62 J/K. The closest option is A:10^62 J/K. However, let me check if there's any miscalculation in the exponents.

Wait, 3.384e18 divided by 2.817e-44 is 3.384 / 2.817 ≈ 1.204, and 10^(18 - (-44)) = 10^62. So 1.204e62, which rounds to 1e62. Therefore, the answer is A.

To determine the order of magnitude of the entropy of the supermassive black hole, we start by using the formula for the entropy of a black hole:

\[
S = \frac{k_B c^3 A}{4 \hbar G},
\]

where \( k_B \) is the Boltzmann constant, \( c \) is the speed of light, \( A \) is the event horizon area, \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant, and \( G \) is the gravitational constant. The area \( A \) of the event horizon is related to the angular size \( \theta \) and the distance \( d \) to the galaxy by the approximation \( A = \pi \theta^2 d^2 \), valid for small angles.

### Step 1: Convert the angular size to radians
The angular size is given as \( \theta = 10^{-17} \) degrees. Converting to radians:

\[
\theta_{\text{rad}} = \theta_{\text{deg}} \cdot \frac{\pi}{180} \approx 10^{-17} \cdot 0.0174533 \approx 1.745 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{radians}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the event horizon area
The distance to the galaxy is \( d = 10^{10} \) parsecs. Converting parsecs to meters:

\[
1 \, \text{parsec} = 3.0857 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m}, \quad d = 10^{10} \cdot 3.0857 \times 10^{16} \approx 3.0857 \times 10^{26} \, \text{m}.
\]

The area of the event horizon is:

\[
A = \pi \theta^2 d^2.
\]

First, compute \( \theta^2 \):

\[
\theta^2 = (1.745 \times 10^{-19})^2 \approx 3.046 \times 10^{-38}.
\]

Next, compute \( d^2 \):

\[
d^2 = (3.0857 \times 10^{26})^2 \approx 9.522 \times 10^{52}.
\]

Multiply \( \theta^2 \) and \( d^2 \):

\[
\theta^2 d^2 = 3.046 \times 10^{-38} \cdot 9.522 \times 10^{52} \approx 2.898 \times 10^{15}.
\]

Multiply by \( \pi \):

\[
A = \pi \cdot 2.898 \times 10^{15} \approx 9.117 \times 10^{15} \, \text{m}^2.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the entropy
Substitute the values into the entropy formula. The constants are:

\[
k_B = 1.380649 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}, \quad c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}, \quad \hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J s}, \quad G = 6.67430 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \, \text{kg}^{-1} \, \text{s}^{-2}.
\]

First, compute \( c^3 \):

\[
c^3 = (3 \times 10^8)^3 = 27 \times 10^{24} = 2.7 \times 10^{25} \, \text{m}^3/\text{s}^3.
\]

Multiply \( k_B \), \( c^3 \), \( A \), and \( \pi \):

\[
k_B c^3 A \pi = (1.380649 \times 10^{-23}) \cdot (2.7 \times 10^{25}) \cdot (9.117 \times 10^{15}).
\]

First, compute \( k_B \cdot c^3 \):

\[
1.380649 \times 10^{-23} \cdot 2.7 \times 10^{25} = 3.727 \times 10^{2} \, \text{J m}^3/\text{s}^3.
\]

Next, multiply by \( A \cdot \pi \):

\[
3.727 \times 10^{2} \cdot 9.117 \times 10^{15} = 3.396 \times 10^{18} \, \text{J m}^2/\text{s}^3.
\]

Now, divide by \( 4 \hbar G \):

\[
4 \hbar G = 4 \cdot (1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (6.67430 \times 10^{-11}) \approx 2.817 \times 10^{-44} \, \text{J m}^3/\text{k}g^{-1} \cdot \text{s}^{-1}.
\]

Finally, divide:

\[
S = \frac{3.396 \times 10^{18}}{2.817 \times 10^{-44}} \approx 1.206 \times 10^{62} \, \text{J/K}.
\]

### Final Answer
The order of magnitude of the entropy of the black hole is approximately \( 10^{62} \, \text{J/K} \).
