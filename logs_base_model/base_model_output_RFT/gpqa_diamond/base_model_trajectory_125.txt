Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question is about two reactions and then analyzing the chromatograms after the products are run on both normal-phase HPLC and chiral-phase HPLC. The options are given, and I need to figure out which one is correct. 

First, let me understand the reactions involved. There are two reactions mentioned: Reaction I and Reaction II. Let's tackle them one by one.

Starting with Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH (lithium aluminum hydride) followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent, typically used to reduce ketones to secondary alcohols. The starting material is a ketone, so the reaction should reduce the ketone group to a secondary alcohol. 

The structure of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a six-carbon chain with a ketone group at position 3 and a methoxy group at position 5. Let me draw this out. The carbonyl group (C=O) is at C3. The methoxy group is at C5. So the structure would be: 

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3. Wait, no. Wait, hexan-3-one means the ketone is on carbon 3 of a six-carbon chain. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, hexan-3-one would be CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-? Wait, maybe I should number the carbons. Let's see: hexan-3-one has the ketone on carbon 3. So the six carbons are 1 to 6. Carbon 3 is the carbonyl. So the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C=O

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: CH(OCH3)-

Carbon 6: CH3?

Wait, maybe it's:

CH2(CH2)2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3? Hmm, maybe not. Let me clarify. Hexan-3-one would be:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5 6

So carbon 3 is the ketone. The structure would be:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, hexan-3-one is (3R or S?) but the configuration is given as (S) at carbon 5. Wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C=O

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: C(OCH3)

Carbon 6: CH2CH3? Wait, maybe not. Let me write it as:

CH2(CH2)2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, maybe that's not right. Alternatively, maybe the structure is:

Positions 1 to 6: 1 2 3 4 5 6

So carbon 3 is the ketone, and carbon 5 has a methoxy group. So the structure would be:

Carbon 1: CH2-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C=O

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: C(OCH3)

Carbon 6: CH2CH3? Wait, maybe it's:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? Hmm, maybe that's hexan-3-one with a methoxy at position 5. So after reduction with LAH, the ketone (position 3) would be reduced to a secondary alcohol. So the product would be (Something)-3-hexanol? Wait, but the configuration might change. Wait, LAH is a strong reducing agent and typically doesn't change the configuration of the carbonyl group. Wait, LAH is a hydride agent. When ketones are reduced, they form secondary alcohols. The stereochemistry at the carbonyl carbon (which is the same carbon as the ketone) is not affected because the reduction doesn't involve any chiral centers. Wait, but in this case, the starting material has a stereocenter at carbon 5 (the methoxy group is at C5, which is a secondary alcohol in the starting material). So the starting material is (S) configuration at C5. After reduction, the product would have a new stereocenter at C3 (since the ketone becomes a secondary alcohol). Wait, but LAH reduction of a ketone to a secondary alcohol is typically not stereoselective. Wait, but let me confirm. LAH is a strong reducing agent, but it's not a chiral auxiliary. So when reducing a ketone to an alcohol, the configuration at the adjacent carbon (which becomes the stereocenter) is determined by the starting material. Wait, actually, the ketone is at C3, so the adjacent carbons are C2 and C4. Wait, but the starting material has a stereocenter at C5. So after reduction, the structure becomes:

The original structure is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The carbonyl is at C3, which is a planar sp2 hybridized carbon. When reduced, it becomes a secondary alcohol. So the structure would be:

CH2CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, the ketone is at C3, so the structure is:

(CH2)2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3. After reduction, it becomes:

(CH2)2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, but the ketone is between C2 and C3? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me number the carbons again. Hexan-3-one: positions 1 to 6. Carbon 3 is the ketone. So the structure is:

1: CH2-

2: CH2-

3: C=O

4: CH2-

5: CH(OCH3)

6: CH2CH3? Wait, but that would make it a seven-carbon chain? Wait, no. Wait, hexan-3-one is a six-carbon chain with the ketone at position 3. So the structure is:

CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, that's seven carbons. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me think again. Hexan-3-one: the ketone is on carbon 3. So:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C=O

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: CH2-

Carbon 6: CH3?

No, that's six carbons. So the structure would be:

CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, that's five carbons. Wait, no. Wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2COCH2CH2CH3? Wait, maybe it's:

Carbon 1: CH2-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: CO-

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: CH2-

Carbon 6: CH3? So the structure is CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3. But then where is the methoxy group? At position 5, so carbon 5 has an OCH3 group. So the structure would be:

Carbon 1: CH2-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C=O

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: C(OCH3)

Carbon 6: CH2CH3? Wait, that's six carbons. Wait, carbon 5 has a substituent. So carbon 5 is a CH(OCH3) group. So the structure is:

CH2CH2C(=O)CH2CH(OCH3)CH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, maybe it's:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C(=O)

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: CH(OCH3)

Carbon 6: CH2CH3? Wait, but that's six carbons. So the full structure would be:

CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3. Wait, but that's seven carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try again. Hexan-3-one is a six-carbon chain with the ketone at position 3. So the structure is:

CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3. But then the methoxy group is at position 5. So position 5 is the fifth carbon. Let me count:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C=O

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: CH(OCH3)

Carbon 6: CH2CH3? Wait, that can't be right because carbon 6 would have two CH2 groups. Wait, maybe it's:

CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3. Wait, but that's seven carbons. I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should move on and come back if this is a major issue.

Assuming that the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, which is reduced by LAH to form a secondary alcohol. The product would be 3-hexanol derivative with a methoxy group at position 5. Wait, but the reduction of ketone to secondary alcohol would create a new stereocenter at C3. However, LAH is a strong reducing agent but doesn't induce any specific stereochemistry. So the product would be a secondary alcohol with a methoxy group on C5. Wait, but the starting material is (S) at C5. After reduction, the stereochemistry at C5 remains the same, but the new stereocenter at C3 (the former ketone carbon) would have an R or S configuration. Wait, but LAH doesn't control stereochemistry here. So the product would be a secondary alcohol with a new stereocenter at C3. However, since the starting material has a stereocenter at C5, which is not adjacent to the ketone, the reduction wouldn't affect it. Therefore, the product from Reaction I would be a secondary alcohol with a methoxy group at C5 and a new stereocenter at C3. But wait, the starting material is (S) configuration at C5. The reduction of the ketone to an alcohol would create a new stereocenter at C3. Since LAH is a strong reducing agent, the reduction is likely to proceed without any stereochemical control, so the product would have a new stereocenter at C3, but the configuration there would depend on the mechanism. However, since ketone reduction by LAH typically doesn't proceed with any stereocontrol, the product would have two stereocenters: the original C5 (S) and the new C3 (R or S). But wait, the original compound is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The ketone is at C3. So the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C=O

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: C(OCH3)

Carbon 6: CH3? Wait, that would be six carbons. So:

CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3. So when reduced, the C=O becomes CH(OH). So the product would be:

CH3-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3. But this would make the molecule have two stereocenters: C3 (OH) and C5 (OCH3). The configuration at C3 would be R or S, but the configuration at C5 remains S. However, since the reduction of a ketone to an alcohol doesn't typically create a stereocenter with any specific configuration, the product would have two stereocenters, one of which is the original S. But since the question is about the number of peaks after chromatography, the stereochemistry might not matter here. Alternatively, maybe the reduction leads to formation of a single stereoisomer. Wait, but LAH is a strong reducing agent and the ketone is symmetric. Wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. Let me check if the ketone is symmetric. The structure around the ketone (C3) would be:

Left of C3: CH2-CH3 (from C1 and C2)

Right of C3: CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3 (from C4, C5, C6)

Wait, so the groups on either side of the ketone are different. Therefore, the ketone is not symmetric, so the reduction would not lead to a single product. Wait, no. Wait, the structure on the left of the ketone (C3) is CH2CH3, and on the right, it's CH2CH(OCH3)CH3. So they are different, so the ketone is not symmetric. Therefore, the reduction would not produce a single stereoisomer. Wait, but how? LAH is a strong base and would abstract a proton, but in this case, the ketone is reduced to an alcohol. However, the reduction of an asymmetric ketone would not create a new stereocenter in a way that leads to multiple products. Wait, but the ketone is asymmetric, so the reduction would proceed without any stereoselectivity, leading to a racemic mixture? Wait, no. Wait, the ketone has two different groups on each side. So when reduced, the resulting alcohol would have a new stereocenter. The configuration at that center would depend on the mechanism. But LAH is typically a hydride agent and doesn't induce any specific stereochemistry. Therefore, the product would be a racemic mixture. Wait, but the starting material already has a stereocenter at C5. So the product would have two stereocenters: C3 (from the reduction) and C5 (from the starting material). So the product would be an epimer at C3. But since the reduction doesn't control the configuration, the product would be a racemic mixture of the two possible diastereomers. Wait, but the starting material's configuration at C5 is S. So the product would have the S configuration at C5 and either R or S configuration at C3. But since the reduction doesn't control this, the product would have two stereocenters with the S configuration at C5 and either R or S at C3. However, since the reduction is from a ketone, which is not symmetric, the product would not be a racemic mixture but would actually form a single diastereomer. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me think again. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The ketone is at C3. The groups on either side of the ketone are CH2CH3 (C2 and C1) and CH2CH(OCH3)CH3 (C4, C5, C6). These are different groups, so the ketone is asymmetric. Therefore, the reduction would lead to a new stereocenter at C3. Since the reduction doesn't induce any preference for R or S configuration, the product would have two possible stereoisomers: one with R configuration at C3 and S at C5, and another with S configuration at C3 and S at C5. Wait, but the starting material's configuration at C5 is fixed. So if the reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3, then the product would have two possible configurations at C3, but the C5 configuration is fixed as S. Therefore, the product would have two stereoisomers: (R) and (S) at C3, while C5 is S. However, since the reduction doesn't control the configuration, both would form. So the product would be a mixture of (R)- and (S)-3-hexanol with the C5 configuration fixed as S. Therefore, there are two stereoisomers. But wait, the question is about the chromatogram. The number of peaks would depend on the number of distinct compounds. If the product is a racemic mixture, there would be two peaks (for the two enantiomers) on a chiral column. But on a normal-phase column, they would elute together as they are not separated. Wait, but the question is about combining the products from both reactions and running them on both types of columns. Let's keep this in mind.

Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by an acidic workup. NaBH4 is a reducing agent. Pentane-2,4-dione has two ketone groups: at positions 2 and 4. The structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no. Wait, pentane-2,4-dione would be:

Positions 1 to 5:

1: CH3-

2: C=O

3: CH2-

4: C=O

5: CH3?

Wait, that would be:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. So, two ketone groups on adjacent carbons (positions 2 and 4 in a five-carbon chain). So the structure is:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. Now, when this is treated with NaBH4, which is a milder reducing agent compared to LAH. NaBH4 typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols but doesn't usually reduce esters or amides. However, in this case, the ketones are in a conjugated system. Wait, but NaBH4 can reduce ketones. Let me confirm. Yes, NaBH4 can reduce ketones to secondary alcohols. However, when there are two ketone groups, sometimes under certain conditions, the reduction can proceed. But in this case, the problem states that excess NaBH4 is used. So both ketones would be reduced. 

So the product would be 2,4-pentanediol. The structure would be:

CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. Wait, but the starting material is pentane-2,4-dione, so after reduction, positions 2 and 4 would each have an OH group. So the product is 2,4-pentanediol. Now, since the two ketones are in symmetric positions (positions 2 and 4), the product would be a single compound. Wait, but let me check the symmetry. The structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. The molecule is symmetric around the center. So if you have two OH groups on symmetric positions, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the product is a single compound, not a mixture. However, wait, if the starting material is symmetric, then the product would also be symmetric. But does the starting material have any stereochemistry? The problem states that pentane-2,4-dione is treated, but it doesn't specify any stereochemistry. So the starting material is probably a diketone without any stereocenters. Therefore, the product would be a single compound, 2,4-pentanediol, which is a single stereoisomer. Wait, but the molecule is symmetric, so even if the OH groups are on different sides, they would be mirror images. Wait, but in this case, the OH groups are on the same side? No, wait. Wait, the starting material is a diketone, which is planar. When reduced, each ketone becomes an alcohol. But in the case of symmetric positions, the reduction would lead to a single diol. However, the configuration of the OH groups would be determined by the reduction. Since NaBH4 is a reducing agent that doesn't have a chiral environment, the reduction would not create any stereochemistry. Wait, but in the case of a symmetric diketone, the reduction would lead to a single diol. For example, if the starting material is (Z) or (E) in some context, but here it's a symmetric diketone. Wait, but the starting material is pentane-2,4-dione, which is a diketone with no stereocenters. Therefore, the product would be 2,4-pentanediol, which is a single compound. However, the molecule is symmetric, so even if each OH is on opposite sides, they would be the same due to symmetry. Wait, but in reality, when you reduce a symmetric diketone, you get a single diol. For example, if you have (CH3)2CO-C(=O)CH2CH3, that's not symmetric. Wait, no. Wait, pentane-2,4-dione is symmetric. So the product would be a single diol. However, if the starting material is symmetric, the product would have two OH groups in symmetric positions. Therefore, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Wait, but if the OH groups are on the same side, then it would have a plane of symmetry. Wait, no. If the OH groups are on the same side, then the molecule would be chiral. Wait, let me think. Suppose the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. If the OH groups are on the same side (both R or both S), then the molecule has a plane of symmetry (mirror plane through the center), making it a meso compound. However, if the OH groups are on opposite sides, then it would not have a plane of symmetry, making it a chiral molecule. But wait, the starting material is a symmetric diketone, so the reduction would not create any stereochemistry. Therefore, the product would be a meso compound. Wait, but NaBH4 reduces ketones to secondary alcohols without any stereochemistry. So each ketone would be reduced to an alcohol with R configuration if the reduction is stereospecific. Wait, but NaBH4 is not a chiral reagent, so the reduction would not create any new stereocenters. Therefore, the product would be a diol with two new stereocenters. Wait, but in the case of a symmetric diketone, the reduction would lead to a single diol. Let me clarify. For example, consider (CH3)C(O)CH2C(O)CH3. If each C=O is reduced to CH(OH), then the product would be (CH3)C(OH)CH2CH(OH)CH3. But since the starting material is symmetric, the product would have two stereocenters. However, due to the symmetry, the molecule would be meso. For example, if the OH groups are on the same side, then it's a meso compound. But if the OH groups are on opposite sides, it's a chiral compound. Wait, but the reduction of a symmetric diketone would lead to a single diol, which is a meso compound. Therefore, the product would have two stereocenters but be a meso compound, so there would be only one peak on a chiral column. But wait, meso compounds have an even number of stereocenters and are achiral. Wait, but if the molecule is symmetric, the two stereocenters would be mirror images. Therefore, the molecule would not be chiral. So if the product is a meso compound, then on a chiral column, it would elute as a single peak. But on a normal-phase column, since the compound is the same, it would not split. Wait, but the question is about combining the products from both reactions. So let's recap:

Reaction I: Starting with (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, reduced to a secondary alcohol with two stereocenters (C3 and C5). The C5 configuration is fixed as S. The C3 configuration could be R or S, but since the starting material has a stereocenter at C5, the product would have two stereoisomers: (R)-3 and (S)-3, but since the starting material's C5 is S, the product would have two stereoisomers: (R)-3 and (S)-3. Wait, but the starting material's configuration at C5 is S, so the product would have C5 as S. But the reduction at C3 would create two possible stereoisomers. Therefore, the product from Reaction I would be a racemic mixture of the two stereoisomers. Wait, but the starting material's configuration at C5 is S. So if the product has two stereocenters, the configurations would be (R and S) at C3 and (S) at C5. But since the starting material's configuration at C5 is fixed, the product would have two possible configurations at C3. Therefore, the product would be a mixture of (R)-3 and (S)-3, each with the C5 as S. Therefore, there are two stereoisomers. However, since the reduction does not control the configuration, the product would be a racemic mixture. Therefore, on a chiral column, these would separate into two peaks. On a normal-phase column, since they are not chiral, they would elute as a single peak. Wait, but the question is about combining both reactions. Let's proceed.

Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione is reduced to 2,4-pentanediol, which is a meso compound. Therefore, on a chiral column, it would elute as a single peak. On a normal-phase column, since it's a single compound, it would also elute as a single peak.

Now, combining the products from both reactions: the products from Reaction I and II are mixed together. Then run them on both types of columns.

First, let's list the products:

From Reaction I: Two stereoisomers (if they are enantiomers) or a racemic mixture. Wait, but the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. After reduction, the product has two stereocenters: C3 and C5. C5 is S. C3 is either R or S. Since the reduction doesn't control the configuration at C3, the product would be a 50:50 mixture of the two stereoisomers. Therefore, on a chiral column, these would separate into two peaks. On a normal-phase column, they would elute as a single peak because they are not chiral.

But wait, if the two stereoisomers are enantiomers, then they would have different configurations at the stereocenters. However, the product from Reaction I has two stereocenters, and if the two stereoisomers are enantiomers, then they would have opposite configurations at both stereocenters. Wait, but in this case, C5 is fixed as S. So the configurations would be (R and S) at C3, while C5 remains S. Therefore, the two stereoisomers would have configurations (R, S) and (S, S). Wait, but that can't be. If C5 is fixed as S, then the two stereoisomers would have configurations (R, S) and (S, S). But that would mean one is (R) at C3 and (S) at C5, and the other is (S) at C3 and (S) at C5. Wait, but if C5 is fixed as S, then the two stereoisomers would have configurations (R, S) and (S, S). These are not enantiomers. Enantiomers would have both configurations opposite. Wait, but if C5 is fixed as S, then the two stereoisomers would differ only at C3. Therefore, they would not be enantiomers. Therefore, they would be diastereomers. However, since the starting material's configuration at C5 is fixed, the product would have two stereocenters with one fixed and the other variable. Therefore, the two stereoisomers would be diastereomers. However, the starting material's configuration at C5 is S, so the product would have C5 as S and C3 as either R or S. Therefore, the two stereoisomers would be (R, S) and (S, S). These are not mirror images, so they are diastereomers. Therefore, on a chiral column, they would separate into two peaks. On a normal-phase column, since they are not chiral, they would elute as a single peak.

Reaction II product: 2,4-pentanediol, which is a meso compound. Therefore, on a chiral column, it would elute as a single peak. On a normal-phase column, since it's a single compound, it would also elute as a single peak.

Now, combining the products:

From Reaction I: Two diastereomers (if they are different compounds) or a racemic mixture if they are enantiomers. Wait, but in this case, they are diastereomers, so racemic would mean they are enantiomers. But in this case, they are diastereomers. Wait, but the product could also be a mixture of the two diastereomers. However, since the reduction doesn't control the configuration, the product would be a racemic mixture of the two stereoisomers. Wait, but the two stereoisomers are not enantiomers. Therefore, the product would not be a racemic mixture but a mixture of two diastereomers. However, if the two diastereomers are present in equimolar amounts, they would elute as two separate peaks on a chiral column. Therefore, Reaction I product would give two peaks on a chiral column and one peak on a normal-phase column. Wait, but if the two diastereomers are present in equal amounts, they would be two separate peaks. If one is more abundant, then one peak would be larger. However, since the reduction is from a single starting material, the product would be a 50:50 mixture of the two stereoisomers. Therefore, two peaks on a chiral column. But wait, the two diastereomers are not enantiomers. Therefore, they would not cancel each other out. Therefore, they would appear as two distinct peaks. On a normal-phase column, since they are not chiral, they would merge into a single peak. Wait, but the normal-phase column separates based on retention time, not on chirality. Since the diastereomers are not chiral, they would elute as a single peak. Wait, but if the diastereomers are different compounds, they would have different retention times. Therefore, on a normal-phase column, they would separate into two peaks. Wait, but the diastereomers are not chiral, so their separation would not be based on their chirality. Therefore, on a normal-phase column, the two diastereomers would have different retention times and would elute as two separate peaks. However, the diastereomers are not enantiomers, so their structures are different. Therefore, on a normal-phase column, they would be separate. But wait, the diastereomers are not chiral, so their presence would not cause any chromatographic separation based on chirality. However, the normal-phase column separates based on retention time. Since the two compounds are different, they would have different retention times and elute as two separate peaks. Therefore, on a normal-phase column, the product from Reaction I would give two peaks, and the product from Reaction II would give one peak (as a single compound). 

But wait, the problem states that the products from both reactions are combined. Therefore, the total product is a mixture of:

From Reaction I: two diastereomers (each 50%?) and 

From Reaction II: one compound (meso diol). 

Wait, but the starting material for Reaction I is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The product from Reaction I would have two stereoisomers: (R, S) and (S, S) at C3 and C5. Wait, but the starting material's C5 is S, so in the product, C5 remains S. The reduction affects C3. Therefore, the two products would be (R) at C3 and (S) at C5, and (S) at C3 and (S) at C5. These are two different diastereomers. So when combined with the meso compound from Reaction II, the total mixture would have three distinct compounds: two diastereomers from Reaction I and one meso compound from Reaction II. 

Now, let's think about the chromatography:

Chiral Column (like HPLC with chiral stationary phase):

- The diastereomers from Reaction I would have different configurations, so they would elute as two separate peaks. The meso compound from Reaction II would elute as a single peak. Therefore, total peaks: 3.

Normal-Phase Column:

- The diastereomers from Reaction I would be different compounds, so they would elute as two peaks. The meso compound from Reaction II would elute as a single peak. Therefore, total peaks: 3.

Wait, but the answer options don't have 3 peaks for both columns. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A. 5 P in chiral and 4 in normal-phase

B. 3 in both

C. 4 in chiral and 2 in normal-phase

D. 3 in chiral and 2 in normal-phase

Hmm. According to my analysis, both columns would show 3 peaks. Therefore, the answer would be B. But wait, let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the diastereomers. Let's reconsider Reaction I.

Reaction I: Starting with (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The structure is CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3. Reducing the ketone to alcohol gives CH3-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3. This molecule has two stereocenters: C3 (OH) and C5 (OCH3). The starting material has C5 as S. The reduction at C3 would create two possible configurations: R or S. However, since the reduction is not stereoselective, the product would be a racemic mixture of the two stereoisomers. Wait, but if the two stereoisomers are enantiomers, then they would be present in equal amounts. However, looking at the configurations, the two stereoisomers would be (R) and (S) at C3, with C5 fixed as S. So the two stereoisomers would have configurations (R, S) and (S, S) at C3 and C5. These are not enantiomers. Enantiomers would have opposite configurations at all stereocenters. In this case, since C5 is fixed as S, the two stereoisomers would differ only at C3. Therefore, they are diastereomers. However, if the two diastereomers are present in equal amounts, they would elute as two separate peaks on a chiral column. 

Similarly, the product from Reaction II is a meso compound, which is a single stereoisomer. Therefore, when combined, the total products are:

- Two diastereomers from Reaction I (each 50% if racemic, but maybe not exactly 50% since they are diastereomers)

- One meso compound from Reaction II.

Therefore, on a chiral column, these would elute as three peaks: two from Reaction I's diastereomers and one from Reaction II's meso compound.

On a normal-phase column, diastereomers have different retention times, so they would elute as three peaks. The meso compound would elute as a single peak. Wait, but wait. The diastereomers from Reaction I would each be single compounds, so they would elute as two peaks. The meso compound would be one peak. Therefore, total peaks: 3 on normal-phase column. But the answer options don't have 3 on both. Option B says 3 peaks in both. So that would fit. 

Wait, but let me verify again. 

Reaction I's product: two diastereomers (if they are present in equal amounts) would give two peaks on chiral and two on normal-phase? Wait, no. Wait, on a normal-phase column, diastereomers are different compounds, so they would each have their own retention times, leading to separate peaks. The meso compound is a single compound, so it would give a single peak. Therefore, total peaks on normal-phase column: 2 (from Reaction I) + 1 (from Reaction II) = 3. 

Similarly, on a chiral column, diastereomers would be separated, so 2 peaks from Reaction I, and 1 peak from Reaction II's meso compound. Therefore, 3 peaks on both columns. 

But wait, if the diastereomers are present in equal amounts, the two peaks from Reaction I would be of equal height. But regardless, they would still be two peaks. So the answer would be B: 3 peaks in both columns.

Wait, but let me check if the Reaction II product is indeed a single compound. Pentane-2,4-dione reduces to 2,4-pentanediol, which is a meso compound. Therefore, on a chiral column, it would elute as a single peak. On a normal-phase column, it would elute as a single peak, as it's a single compound.

Therefore, combining all products:

Reaction I: 2 diastereomers → 2 peaks on chiral, 2 peaks on normal-phase.

Reaction II: 1 meso compound → 1 peak on both columns.

Total:

Chiral: 2 + 1 = 3 peaks.

Normal-phase: 2 + 1 = 3 peaks.

Therefore, answer B: 3 peaks in both columns.

But wait, let me check if the Reaction I product is actually two diastereomers or a single compound. Wait, if the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, reducing the ketone to secondary alcohol would create a new stereocenter. The configuration at the new stereocenter (C3) is determined by the reduction. Since the starting material's configuration at C5 is S, the product's configuration at C3 could be R or S. If the reduction is not stereoselective, the product would be equal parts (R) and (S) at C3. Therefore, the product would be a racemic mixture of two stereoisomers. However, if the two stereoisomers are enantiomers, then they would be present in equal amounts. But earlier analysis suggested they are diastereomers. Wait, let's clarify.

The two stereoisomers from Reaction I would have configurations:

1. (R) at C3, (S) at C5.

2. (S) at C3, (S) at C5.

These are two different diastereomers. However, since the starting material's configuration at C5 is S, the product's configuration at C5 is fixed as S. The reduction would create two possible configurations at C3. Therefore, the two stereoisomers are diastereomers. Therefore, they would be separated on a chiral column, resulting in two peaks. 

Therefore, combining both reactions:

Reaction I: 2 peaks (diastereomers) + Reaction II: 1 peak (meso) → total 3 peaks on chiral column.

Reaction I: 2 peaks (different diastereomers) + Reaction II: 1 peak (meso) → total 3 peaks on normal-phase column.

Thus, the answer is B: 3 peaks in both.
