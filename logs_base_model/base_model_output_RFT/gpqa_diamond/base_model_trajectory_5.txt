Okay, so I need to figure out the energy spectrum for a quantum mechanical particle in this given potential. The potential is V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem.

First, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the energy spectrum depends on the potential's form. Since the potential is in two dimensions and involves both r and θ, maybe it's helpful to separate the variables or think about the problem in polar coordinates. Let me think about how to approach this.

The potential has two terms: the first term is (1/2)k r², which looks like a harmonic oscillator term in the radial direction. The second term is (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Wait, cos²θ reminds me of the angular part of the potential. Maybe this is a combination of harmonic potentials in different directions?

Alternatively, perhaps the potential can be rewritten in a way that separates the r and θ dependencies. Let me try to combine the terms. The total potential is V = (1/2)k r² (1 + 3 cos²θ). Hmm, that's an interesting combination. Maybe I can express this in terms of other coordinates or a different potential form.

Wait, another thought: the potential resembles a harmonic oscillator but with an angular dependence. If the potential were V = (1/2)k r² (1 + 3 cos²θ), maybe this is similar to a particle in a 2D harmonic oscillator but with an additional angular term. Alternatively, perhaps it's a combination of potentials in different directions.

Alternatively, maybe we can diagonalize the Hamiltonian by considering the angular part. Let me think about the angular part of the potential. The term 3 cos²θ can be rewritten using a trigonometric identity: cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So substituting that in, the potential becomes V = (1/2)k r² [1 + 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2] = (1/2)k r² [1 + 3/2 + (3/2)cos2θ] = (1/2)k r² [5/2 + (3/2)cos2θ]. So V = (5/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ.

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe there's a better approach. Let me recall that in two dimensions, the Schrödinger equation in polar coordinates is often separable. The Hamiltonian is H = -ℏ²/(2m) (1/r)(d/dr)(r dψ/dr) + (1/r²)(-d²ψ/dθ²) + V(r,θ). So the equation is separable into radial and angular parts if the potential is of the form V(r,θ) = V_r(r) + V_θ(θ). Wait, in this case, V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. So V(r,θ) = V_r(r) + V_θ(r,θ), where V_r(r) = (1/2)k r² and V_θ(r,θ) = (3/2)k r² cos²θ. But V_θ depends on both r and θ. That complicates things because the potential isn't purely a sum of a radial and angular part. So the Hamiltonian isn't separable in this case. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, maybe there's a way to separate variables here. Let me think. Suppose we try to separate the variables by assuming ψ(r,θ) = R(r) Φ(θ). Then substituting into the Schrödinger equation:

[-ℏ²/(2m) (1/r)(d/dr)(r dR/dr) R + (1/r²) (-d²Φ/dθ²) Φ + V(r,θ) R Φ ] = E R Φ

Dividing both sides by R Φ:

[-ℏ²/(2m) (1/r)(d/dr)(r dR/dr) + (1/r²)(-d²Φ/dθ²)/Φ + V(r,θ)] = E

So the equation would be:

-ℏ²/(2m) (1/r)(d/dr)(r dR/dr) + (1/r²)(-d²Φ/dθ²)/Φ + V(r,θ) = E

But since V(r,θ) depends on both r and θ, we can't separate terms involving r and θ. That means the equation isn't separable, which complicates things. Hmm. So maybe this approach won't work. Alternatively, perhaps there's another coordinate system or transformation that can make the problem separable.

Wait, another idea. Let's consider a substitution to make the potential easier. The potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let me factor out (1/2)k r²: V = (1/2)k r² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Maybe this can be rewritten in terms of another potential. Alternatively, perhaps we can perform a change of variables to diagonalize the potential.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential can be considered as a combination of two harmonic oscillators in different directions. Wait, harmonic oscillator in x and y directions: V = (1/2)k (x² + y²). But here, the potential is V = (1/2)k r² (1 + 3 cos²θ). Let's see: in polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. So cosθ = x/r, sinθ = y/r. Then cos²θ = x²/r². So 1 + 3 cos²θ = 1 + 3x²/r². Then V = (1/2)k r² (1 + 3x²/r²) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k x². Wait, that's interesting. So V = (1/2)k (r² + 3x²). Let's expand that: V = (1/2)k (x² + y² + 3x²) = (1/2)k (4x² + y²). So V = 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Ah! So this potential is equivalent to a 2D harmonic oscillator with different frequencies in the x and y directions. The potential in x is 2k x², and in y is (1/2)k y². So in terms of the harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are quantized as E = (n_x + n_y + 1) ℏω, where ω is the angular frequency. But here, the frequencies are different for x and y.

In a 2D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are E = (n_x + n_y + 1) ℏω, where ω is the same for both directions. But here, the potential is different in x and y, so the frequencies are different. Let's compute the frequencies for each direction.

For the x-direction: The potential is 2k x². The standard harmonic oscillator potential is (1/2)k_x x². Comparing, we have (1/2)k_x = 2k ⇒ k_x = 4k. The angular frequency ω_x is sqrt(k_x / m) = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 sqrt(k/m).

For the y-direction: The potential is (1/2)k y². The standard form is (1/2)k_y y², so k_y = k. The angular frequency ω_y is sqrt(k/m).

In the 2D harmonic oscillator with different frequencies, the energy levels are E = (n_x + n_y + 1) ℏ (ω_x + ω_y)/2? Wait, no. Wait, in the standard case with the same frequency, the energy levels are E = (n_x + n_y + 1) ℏω. But when the frequencies are different, the energy levels are E = (n_x + 1/2) ℏω_x + (n_y + 1/2) ℏω_y. Because each direction contributes its own energy. So total energy E = (n_x + 1/2) ℏω_x + (n_y + 1/2) ℏω_y.

So substituting the frequencies we found:

E = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ * 2 sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m)

Factor out sqrt(k/m):

E = sqrt(k/m) [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ) ] ℏ

Simplify inside the brackets:

2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 = 2n_x + n_y + 3/2

So E = [2n_x + n_y + 3/2] sqrt(k/m) ℏ

Which matches option B: E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m)

Wait, but let me double-check. The potential was transformed into 2k x² + (1/2)k y². So the x-direction has k_x =4k, leading to ω_x=2 sqrt(k/m). The y-direction has ω_y= sqrt(k/m). Then energy is (n_x +1/2)ℏω_x + (n_y +1/2)ℏω_y = (n_x +1/2)*2ℏ sqrt(k/m) + (n_y +1/2)ℏ sqrt(k/m) = [2n_x +1 + n_y +1/2] ℏ sqrt(k/m) = (2n_x +n_y + 3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m). Yes, that's exactly option B.

But wait, let me check the choices again. Option B is (2n_x +n_y +3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m). So yes, that's correct. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the transformation.

Original potential: V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Then expanding:

V = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Then substituting cos²θ = x²/r²:

V = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k x². Then expanding r² = x² + y²:

V = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x² = (1/2)k x² + (1/2)k y² + (3/2)k x² = (2k x²) + (1/2)k y². Yes, that's correct. So the potential is indeed 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Therefore, the energy levels are as derived, leading to option B. But wait, the answer options use n_x and n_y as quantum numbers. In the harmonic oscillator, each direction has its own quantum number, so n_x and n_y are independent non-negative integers. So the energy spectrum is a sum of the individual contributions from each direction.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option B. Let me check the other options to ensure there's no confusion.

Option A: E = (n_x +3n_y +3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m). That would imply different frequencies, but seems unlikely.

Option C: E = (2n_x +3n_y +1/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m). Doesn't match our result.

Option D: E = (3n_x +2n_y +1/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m). Also doesn't match.

So yes, option B is correct. But let me think again: the problem statement mentions "the correct answer to this question: ... Find the energy spectrum." The potential is given in polar coordinates, but by transforming it into Cartesian coordinates, we saw it becomes equivalent to a 2D harmonic oscillator with different frequencies in x and y. Therefore, the energy levels are the sum of each direction's energy. Hence, the correct expression is (2n_x +n_y + 3/2)ℏ sqrt(k/m), which is option B.

I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning. The key was realizing that the angular dependence allows the potential to be rewritten in terms of x and y, making it separable into two independent harmonic oscillators. Then, the energy levels are just the sum of the individual energies in each direction. So the answer should be B.
Therefore, the correct answer is option B.
