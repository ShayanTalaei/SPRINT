Okay, so I need to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction for this electron scattering experiment. The given phase shifts are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. The electrons are at 50 MeV, and the target is nuclear. The question tells me to ignore the other phase shifts, so I probably only need to consider up to δ₄. 

First, I remember that in elastic scattering, the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed in terms of phase shifts. The general formula is f(θ) = (1/k) * sum_{n=0}^∞ (2n+1) e^{iδ_n} sin(δ_n) P_n(cosθ), where k is the wave number, P_n are Legendre polynomials, and δ_n are the phase shifts. But since we're asked for the imaginary part along the incident beam direction, that would be at θ=0°, right? Because the incident beam is coming along a particular direction, so θ=0 would be directly in front. 

Wait, but the question says "along the incident beam direction". So maybe that's the forward direction, θ=0°. Let me confirm. The scattering amplitude is a function of the scattering angle θ. The forward direction is θ=0°, so that's where the incident beam is coming from. So the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0° is the value we need. 

But the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by the sum over n of terms involving (2n+1) e^{iδ_n} sin(δ_n) P_n(cosθ). The imaginary part of f(θ) would then be the sum over n of (2n+1) sin(δ_n) sin(δ_n + φ_n), where φ_n is the phase from the Legendre polynomial? Wait, maybe I need to break it down step by step. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a simpler formula when considering the forward direction. Let me recall. For the scattering amplitude in terms of phase shifts, when θ=0, cosθ=1, so P_n(cosθ)=P_n(1)=1 for all n. So the scattering amplitude simplifies to f(0) = (1/k) sum_{n=0}^∞ (2n+1) e^{iδ_n} sin(δ_n). 

Therefore, the imaginary part of f(0) would be Im(f(0)) = (1/k) sum_{n=0}^∞ (2n+1) sin(δ_n) sin(δ_n + 0), since the imaginary part of e^{iδ_n} is sinδ_n. Wait, e^{iδ_n} = cosδ_n + i sinδ_n. So when you multiply by sinδ_n, the imaginary part comes from the sinδ_n * sinδ_n term. Wait, let me re-express this. 

So f(0) = (1/k) sum (2n+1) e^{iδ_n} sinδ_n. Expanding e^{iδ_n} gives cosδ_n + i sinδ_n. Therefore, f(0) = (1/k) sum (2n+1) [cosδ_n sinδ_n + i sin²δ_n]. So the imaginary part is (1/k) sum (2n+1) sin²δ_n. 

Therefore, Im(f(0)) = (1/k) sum_{n=0}^4 (2n+1) sin²δ_n. Since we're ignoring the rest of the phase shifts beyond δ₄, the sum goes up to n=4. 

Now, I need to compute this sum. Let's list the terms for each δ_n:

For n=0: (2*0 +1) sin²(90°) = 1 * sin²(90°). Sin(90°) is 1, so sin² is 1. So term is 1*1=1.

n=1: (2*1 +1)=3, sin²(67°). Let's compute sin(67°). 67 degrees is approximately 0.3907 radians. Wait, but maybe I should use exact values. Let me check. Wait, 67 degrees. Let me use a calculator. Sin(67°) ≈ 0.9205, so sin² ≈ 0.847. Then 3*0.847 ≈ 2.541.

n=2: (2*2 +1)=5, sin²(55°). Sin(55°) ≈ 0.8192, so sin²≈0.671. 5*0.671≈3.355.

n=3: (2*3 +1)=7, sin²(30°). Sin(30°)=0.5, so sin²=0.25. 7*0.25=1.75.

n=4: (2*4 +1)=9, sin²(13°). Sin(13°)≈0.22495, so sin²≈0.05058. 9*0.05058≈0.4552.

Now sum all these terms: 1 + 2.541 + 3.355 + 1.75 + 0.4552 ≈ 1+2.541=3.541; 3.541+3.355=6.896; 6.896+1.75=8.646; 8.646+0.4552≈9.1012.

So the sum is approximately 9.1012. Then multiply by (1/k). Wait, what's k here? The wave number k is given by k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ, but maybe in units where ħc=197.3 MeV·fm, so k in fm⁻¹ is k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ. But perhaps there's a standard expression for k in terms of energy. Wait, in natural units where ħ=1 and c=1, but in units where ħc=197.3 MeV·fm, then k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ. Wait, but m is the electron mass. Let me recall the formula. 

The wave number k is given by k = (1/ħ) * sqrt(2mE). In units where ħ=197.3 MeV·fm (since ħc ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm), so k = sqrt(2mE)/ (ħ). But m is the electron mass, which is m_e ≈ 0.511 MeV/c². So substituting:

k = sqrt(2 * 0.511 MeV/c² * 50 MeV) / (ħ). Wait, but since ħc ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm, then ħ = ħc / c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm / c. Wait, but units might be getting a bit messy here. Let me think again. 

Alternatively, using natural units where ħ=1 and c=1, but in those units, k would be expressed as sqrt(2mE). But since we need k in fm⁻¹, let's compute it properly. 

The energy E is given as 50 MeV. The electron mass m_e is approximately 0.511 MeV/c². So the total energy is 50 MeV. The kinetic energy is 50 MeV, so the total energy is E = K + m_e c² ≈ 50 + 0.511 ≈ 50.511 MeV. But since 50 MeV is much larger than m_e c², we can approximate E ≈ 50 MeV. 

Then, the momentum p = sqrt(2mE) ≈ sqrt(2 * 0.511 MeV/c² * 50 MeV) = sqrt(51.1) MeV·c ≈ 7.15 MeV·c. Then, k = p/(ħ). Since ħc ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm, then ħ = ħc / c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm / c. So k ≈ p/(ħ) = (7.15 MeV·c) / (197.33 MeV·fm / c) ) = (7.15 * c) / (197.33 / c) ) * MeV·c² / MeV·fm. Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let's use the formula k = sqrt(2mE)/(ħ). But since E is in MeV, m in MeV/c², and ħ in MeV·fm/c. Wait, perhaps it's easier to use the relation that k (in fm⁻¹) is given by k = sqrt(2mE) / (ħ c) * c. Wait, maybe I should use the formula for k in terms of E and m. 

Alternatively, using the relation k = (1/ħ) * sqrt(2mE), and knowing that ħc ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm, so ħ = ħc / c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm / c. Therefore, k = sqrt(2mE) / (ħc / c) ) = c sqrt(2mE) / (ħc) ) = sqrt(2mE)/(ħ). But units here are tricky. Let me compute it numerically. 

m_e = 0.511 MeV/c², E = 50 MeV. So sqrt(2 m_e E) = sqrt(2 * 0.511 * 50) = sqrt(51.1) ≈ 7.15 MeV/c. Then, k = (7.15 MeV/c) / (ħ). But ħ = 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s, but in units where ħc ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm, so 1 fm = 1e-15 m, and 1 fm⁻¹ is 1e15 m⁻¹. 

Alternatively, using the formula k (fm⁻¹) = sqrt(2m_e E) * (1 fm) / (ħ c). Wait, maybe a better approach is to use the relation that k (fm⁻¹) = (sqrt(2 m_e E) [MeV/c]) ) / (ħ c [MeV·fm]). 

Let me compute sqrt(2 m_e E) first. 2 * 0.511 MeV/c² * 50 MeV = 2 * 0.511 * 50 * (MeV^2/c²) ) = 51.1 MeV²/c². So sqrt(51.1) ≈ 7.15 MeV/c. So k = 7.15 MeV/c / (197.33 MeV·fm) ) * c? Wait, maybe not. Let's think again. 

Wait, the formula for k in fm⁻¹ is k = sqrt(2 m_e E) / ( ħ c ) * (1 fm). Wait, no. Let's recall that ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm. So 1 fm = 1e-15 m. So to get k in fm⁻¹, we have:

k (fm⁻¹) = sqrt(2 m_e E) [MeV/c] / (ħ c [MeV·fm]) ) * c [m/s]?

Wait, maybe a different approach. Let me use the formula for k in inverse femtometers. 

The relation is k = sqrt(2 m_e E) / (ħ c) * c. Wait, perhaps it's better to use the formula:

k (fm⁻¹) = sqrt(2 m_e E) (MeV/c) / (ħ c) (MeV·fm)) ) * (1 fm⁻¹) 

Wait, let me compute this step by step. 

First, compute sqrt(2 m_e E):

m_e = 0.511 MeV/c²

E = 50 MeV

sqrt(2 * 0.511 * 50) = sqrt(51.1) ≈ 7.15 MeV/c

Then, ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm

Therefore, k = (7.15 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV·fm) ) * (c) ?

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the units properly. Let's see: 

k has units of 1/length. So in natural units where ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm, then k (fm⁻¹) = (sqrt(2 m_e E) [MeV/c]) ) / (ħ c [MeV·fm]) ) * (1 fm) [since 1 fm = 1e-15 m, but maybe the conversion is different]. 

Wait, perhaps a better way: 

The formula for k in fm⁻¹ is:

k = sqrt(2 m_e E) / (ħ c) * (1 fm) 

Wait, no. Let's think in terms of converting the units. 

sqrt(2 m_e E) gives units of MeV/c. To convert MeV/c to 1/fm, we can use the conversion factor. Since ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm, then 1 MeV·fm = ħ c. Therefore, MeV/c = (MeV·fm) / (fm) ) * (1/c). Wait, maybe it's better to write:

1 MeV/c = (1 MeV·fm) / (c * fm) ) = (ħ c) / (c * fm) ) = ħ / (fm). 

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's use the fact that ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm. Therefore, 1 fm = 197.33 MeV·fm / (ħ c) ) * fm. Wait, maybe an alternative approach: 

Let me compute k in units of inverse femtometers (fm⁻¹). 

k (fm⁻¹) = (sqrt(2 m_e E) [MeV/c]) ) / (ħ c [MeV·fm]) ) * (1 fm) 

Wait, maybe the formula is:

k (fm⁻¹) = sqrt(2 m_e E) [MeV/c] * (1 fm) / (ħ c [MeV·fm]) )

Because k = sqrt(2 m_e E) / (ħ c) * (1 fm) [to cancel the units]. 

So:

sqrt(2 m_e E) = 7.15 MeV/c

Then, 7.15 MeV/c * (1 fm) / (197.33 MeV·fm) ) 

The MeV cancels, fm cancels with fm in denominator, c remains. Wait, but the units may not be matching. Let's check again. 

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

k (fm⁻¹) = sqrt(2 m_e E) [MeV/c] * (1 fm) / (ħ c [MeV·fm]) )

So:

sqrt(2 m_e E) = 7.15 MeV/c

Multiply by 1 fm: 7.15 MeV/c * fm 

Divide by ħ c = 197.33 MeV·fm 

So 7.15 * fm / (197.33 * fm) ) * (MeV/c) / (MeV) ) 

Wait, the MeV cancels, the fm cancels with the denominator's fm, leaving 1/c. Wait, this doesn't seem right. Maybe I need to use the conversion factor for inverse femtometers. 

Alternatively, let's recall that 1 fm⁻¹ = ħ c / (1 fm) ≈ 197.33 MeV. So k in fm⁻¹ is k = (sqrt(2 m_e E) [MeV/c]) ) / (ħ c [MeV·fm]) ) * (1 fm) 

So:

k = (7.15 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV·fm) ) * (1 fm) 

The MeV cancels, and the fm in the denominator cancels with the fm from the numerator. Then, 7.15 / 197.33 ≈ 0.03618 fm⁻¹. 

Wait, that can't be right because 0.036 fm⁻¹ is a very small k. But for 50 MeV electrons, the wavelength should be λ = h/(p) ≈ 12.3 / sqrt(50) ≈ 1.75 Å = 175 fm. So k = 2π / λ ≈ 2π / 175 fm ≈ 0.036 fm⁻¹. So that matches. So k ≈ 0.036 fm⁻¹. 

Therefore, k ≈ 0.036 fm⁻¹. 

So going back to the sum we calculated earlier: sum ≈ 9.1012. Then, Im(f(0)) = (1/k) * sum ≈ (1 / 0.036) * 9.1012 ≈ 25.278 * 9.1012 ≈ 230.3 fm. 

But wait, the options are around 87163 fm, 251.271, 355.351, 177.675. Wait, none of these are close to 230. So I must have made a mistake here. Let me check my calculations again. 

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula for Im(f(0)). Let's re-examine the scattering amplitude. 

The forward scattering amplitude is f(0) = (1/k) sum_{n=0}^∞ (2n+1) e^{iδ_n} sinδ_n. 

Taking the imaginary part: Im(f(0)) = (1/k) sum_{n=0}^∞ (2n+1) sinδ_n sin(δ_n + 0) = (1/k) sum (2n+1) sin²δ_n. 

Yes, that's correct. 

But wait, the problem says "along the incident beam direction". The incident beam direction is at θ=0, so the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is f(0). The imaginary part of f(0) is the absorption coefficient, but in the scattering cross-section calculation, the total cross-section is σ = (4π/k²) |f(0)|². But here, the question is directly asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. 

So my calculation of Im(f(0)) ≈ (1/0.036) * 9.101 ≈ 25.277 * 9.101 ≈ 230.3 fm. But none of the options are close to this. The options are A 251.271, B 177.675, C 87163.4, D 355.351. So 251 is close to my result. Hmm. But why is there a discrepancy? Let me check the calculations again. 

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum. Let's recompute the sum with more precise values. 

n=0: 1 * sin²(90°). sin(90)=1, so 1*1=1. 

n=1: 3 * sin²(67°). Let's compute sin(67°). 67 degrees in radians is 67 * π/180 ≈ 1.16937 radians. sin(1.16937) ≈ 0.9205. So sin²≈0.847. 3*0.847≈2.541. 

n=2: 5 * sin²(55°). 55 degrees. sin(55)≈0.8192, so sin²≈0.671. 5*0.671≈3.355. 

n=3: 7 * sin²(30°). sin(30)=0.5, so sin²=0.25. 7*0.25=1.75. 

n=4:9 * sin²(13°). sin(13)≈0.22495, so sin²≈0.05058. 9*0.05058≈0.455. 

Adding them up: 1 + 2.541 = 3.541; +3.355=6.896; +1.75=8.646; +0.455≈9.099. So approximately 9.1. 

Then, k≈0.036 fm⁻¹. So 1/k≈27.778 fm. Then, 27.778 *9.1≈252.3 fm. Which is close to option A:251.271. But why the slight discrepancy? Maybe my k calculation is slightly off. Let me recalculate k more accurately. 

Earlier, I used k ≈ sqrt(2 m_e E)/(ħ c) * (1 fm) / (ħ c), but perhaps a more accurate approach is to compute k in fm⁻¹ directly. 

Given E=50 MeV, m_e=0.511 MeV/c². 

So sqrt(2 m_e E) = sqrt(2 *0.511 *50) = sqrt(51.1) ≈7.15 MeV/c. 

Then, k = sqrt(2 m_e E) / (ħ c) * (1 fm) 

Wait, but ħ c ≈197.33 MeV·fm. So 1 fm = 1e-15 m. But in terms of units, 1 fm⁻¹ = 1e15 m⁻¹. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

k (fm⁻¹) = sqrt(2 m_e E) [MeV/c] / (ħ c [MeV·fm]) ) * (1 fm) 

Wait, no. Let me think again. 

The formula for wavenumber k in units of fm⁻¹ is:

k (fm⁻¹) = sqrt(2 m_e E) [MeV/c] * (1 fm) / (ħ c [MeV·fm])

Because:

k has units of 1/length. Let's see:

sqrt(2 m_e E) [MeV/c] * (1 fm) [unit] / (ħ c [MeV·fm]) [unit] 

So MeV cancels, fm cancels, and we have 1/c divided by 1, so units would be 1/(fm·c). Wait, this is not correct. I think I need to use the conversion factor properly. 

Alternatively, we can use the formula:

k (fm⁻¹) = (sqrt(2 m_e E) [MeV/c]) ) * (1 fm) / (ħ c [MeV·fm]) )

So the steps are:

sqrt(2 m_e E) = 7.15 MeV/c 

Then, multiply by 1 fm: 7.15 MeV/c * fm 

Divide by ħ c = 197.33 MeV·fm 

So:

(7.15 * fm) / (197.33 * MeV·fm) ) * (MeV/c) 

Wait, the MeV cancels, the fm cancels, leaving 1/c. 

So 7.15 / 197.33 ≈0.03618, and the result is 0.03618 / c. But c is approximately 3e8 m/s, but in terms of units, perhaps we need to convert into inverse femtometers. 

Alternatively, since k is given by:

k = (sqrt(2 m_e E) * 10^15 m ) / (ħ c ) 

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the conversion factor for k in terms of E in MeV. 

The formula for k in fm⁻¹ is:

k (fm⁻¹) = sqrt(2 m_e E (MeV)) / (ħ c) / (1 fm) 

But this is getting too tangled. Let me look up the formula for k in terms of E in MeV and convert units carefully. 

From the definition:

k = p/ħ, where p is the momentum. 

p = sqrt(2 m_e E) 

E is in MeV, m_e is 0.511 MeV/c². 

So p = sqrt(2 * 0.511 MeV/c² * 50 MeV) = sqrt(51.1) MeV/c ≈7.15 MeV/c. 

ħ = 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s = 6.582×10^-22 J·s. 

But 1 J = 1 kg·m²/s². 

But perhaps a better way is to convert p into units of fm⁻¹. 

Since 1 eV = 1.7827e-30 kg·m²/s². So 1 MeV = 1e6 eV. 

p =7.15 MeV/c. Let's convert MeV/c to kg·m/s. 

1 MeV/c = (1e6 eV)/c = (1e6 * 1.602e-19 J)/c = (1.602e-13 J)/c. 

But J = kg·m²/s², so 1.602e-13 kg·m²/s² / c. 

Then, p =7.15 * (1.602e-13 kg·m²/s² ) / c / (3e8 m/s) 

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Let me use the conversion factor for inverse femtometers. 

Alternatively, use the relation that 1 fm = 1e-15 m. 

So, 1 fm⁻¹ = 1e15 m⁻¹. 

But ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm. 

So, 1 fm = 197.33 MeV·fm / (ħ c) ) * fm²? Wait, perhaps another approach. 

Let me use the formula:

k (fm⁻¹) = (sqrt(2 m_e E) [MeV/c]) ) * (1 fm) / (ħ c [MeV·fm]) )

Which simplifies to:

k (fm⁻¹) = (sqrt(2 m_e E) ) / (ħ c) * (1 fm) / (1 fm) 

Wait, that would be:

k (fm⁻¹) = sqrt(2 m_e E) / (ħ c) 

But sqrt(2 m_e E) is in MeV/c, and ħ c is in MeV·fm. 

So:

sqrt(2 m_e E) / (ħ c) = (MeV/c) / (MeV·fm) ) = 1/(c·fm). 

But 1/(c·fm) is a unit of inverse meters. Wait, but we need k in fm⁻¹. 

Alternatively, perhaps using the conversion factor:

1 fm⁻¹ = ħ c / (1 fm) ≈ 197.33 MeV. 

So, k (fm⁻¹) = (sqrt(2 m_e E) [MeV/c] ) * (1 fm) / (ħ c [MeV·fm] ) 

Which is:

k = (sqrt(2 m_e E) * 1 fm) / (ħ c * 1 fm) ) 

Wait, the fm cancels out. Then, k (fm⁻¹) = sqrt(2 m_e E) / (ħ c) 

But sqrt(2 m_e E) is in MeV/c. So units would be (MeV/c) / (MeV·fm) ) = 1/(c·fm). 

But 1/(c·fm) = 1/(3e8 m/s * 1e-15 m) ) = 1/(3e-7 s) ) = 3.33e6 s⁻¹. Which is 3.33e6 Hz. 

Wait, but we need k in fm⁻¹. So perhaps this approach is not working. Let me look up the formula for k in terms of E and m. 

The standard formula is:

k = sqrt(2 m E) / ħ 

But in units where ħ c = 197.33 MeV·fm, then:

k (fm⁻¹) = sqrt(2 m E) (c) / (ħ c^2) * (1 fm) 

Wait, perhaps it's best to use the formula:

k (fm⁻¹) = sqrt(2 m_e E) [MeV/c] * (1 fm) / (ħ c [MeV·fm]) )

= sqrt(2 m_e E) / (ħ c) * (1 fm) / (1 fm) ) 

= sqrt(2 m_e E) / (ħ c) 

But sqrt(2 m_e E) is in MeV/c. So converting to units of fm⁻¹, we need to relate MeV/c to fm⁻¹. 

Alternatively, use the fact that ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm. So 1 MeV/c = (1 MeV)/(3e8 m/s) ) = (1e6 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV) / (3e8 m/s) ) 

But this is getting too complicated. Maybe a better approach is to use the known value of k for 50 MeV electrons. 

The relativistic electron energy E = 50 MeV, m_e = 0.511 MeV/c². 

The momentum p = sqrt(2 m_e E) ≈ sqrt(2 *0.511 *50) ≈7.15 MeV/c. 

Then, ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm. 

So, k = p / ħ = (7.15 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV·fm) ) * c 

Wait, no. Wait, ħ = 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s. But perhaps a better way is to use the relation:

k (fm⁻¹) = p (MeV/c) * (1 fm) / (ħ c (MeV·fm)) )

So:

k = (7.15 MeV/c) * (1 fm) / (197.33 MeV·fm) ) 

= 7.15 / 197.33 fm⁻¹ 

≈ 0.03618 fm⁻¹. 

So k ≈ 0.03618 fm⁻¹. 

Then, Im(f(0)) = (1/k) * sum ≈ (1/0.03618) * 9.1 ≈ 27.65 * 9.1 ≈ 251.2 fm. 

Which matches option A:251.271 fm. 

So that's the answer. 

But wait, why did the initial approximate calculation give me 252.3 and the precise calculation gives 251.271? Because with more precise numbers, the sum was 9.099, so 1/0.03618 ≈27.65, 27.65*9.099≈251.2. 

So the correct answer should be A.251.271 fm. 

But let me check again the sum calculation with precise values. 

n=0: 1 * sin²(90)=1. 

n=1: 3 * sin²(67°). Let's compute sin(67°) accurately. 

sin(67°) = sin(1.16937 radians) ≈0.92050485. So sin²≈0.8472. 3*0.8472=2.5416. 

n=2:5 * sin²(55°). sin(55°)=0.819152044, sin²≈0.671. 5*0.671=3.355. 

n=3:7 * sin²(30°)=7*(0.25)=1.75. 

n=4:9 * sin²(13°). sin(13°)=0.224951054, sin²≈0.05058. 9*0.05058≈0.455. 

Sum:1 +2.5416=3.5416; +3.355=6.8966; +1.75=8.6466; +0.455≈9.1016. 

So sum≈9.1016. 

k=0.03618 fm⁻¹. 

Im(f(0))=9.1016 /0.03618 ≈251.2 fm. 

Yes, that's accurate. So the answer is A.251.271 fm. 

But wait, the options are A:251.271, which is very close. So this must be the correct answer. 

But the user provided options: 

A. 251.271 fm

B. 177.675 fm

C. 87163.4 fm

D. 355.351 fm

So the correct option is A.
