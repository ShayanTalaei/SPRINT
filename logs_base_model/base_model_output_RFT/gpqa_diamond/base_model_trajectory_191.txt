Okay, let's try to figure out this physics problem. Hmm, so the question is about finding the electric field at a point outside a conducting sphere with a cavity inside. Let me start by recalling what I know about conductors in electrostatics.

So, the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R, and inside it, there's a small cavity. The center of the cavity is separated by a distance s from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. Then, there's a small positive charge +q placed inside the cavity. The question is asking for the magnitude of the electric field at a point P, which is outside the conductor, at a distance L from the center. The distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and the angle between l and s is theta. Also, both l and L are greater than R.

Alright, let's break this down. First, since the conductor is uncharged, the charges should redistribute on the surface. But wait, the conductor is uncharged initially, and the charge +q is inside the cavity. How does that affect the conductor's charges?

In electrostatics, when you have a charge inside a conducting cavity, the conductor's inner surface must develop a charge equal and opposite to the cavity's charge. So, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's inner wall) would have a charge of -q. But since the conductor itself is neutral overall, the outer surface must have a charge of +q. Because the total charge on the conductor is the sum of the inner and outer charges: (-q) + (+q) = 0. So the outer surface has a charge of +q.

Now, the electric field outside a conductor is determined by the charges on its outer surface. But wait, the conductor's outer surface is a spherical shell of radius R. So, if we have a charge +q on the outer surface, the electric field outside the conductor (which is a sphere of radius R) would follow the inverse square law, right? Because the charge distribution on the outer surface of a conductor is spherically symmetric, so the field outside is as if all the charge were concentrated at the center.

But wait, the point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. But the conductor's outer radius is R, so if L > R, the point is outside the conductor. The electric field at P would then be due to the charge +q on the outer surface. So according to Gauss's law, the electric field should be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/L². That's option A.

But hold on, the problem mentions that the point P is outside the conductor, and the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l. Also, there's an angle theta between l and s. Does this affect the electric field? Because in the case of a spherical conductor with a cavity, the charges induced on the inner surface are dependent on the position of the charge inside the cavity?

Wait, no. Wait, in the case of a conductor with a charge inside a cavity, the electric field inside the conductor is zero. But the charges on the inner surface adjust so that the field inside the conductor (and cavity) is zero. However, the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge on the outer surface. Since the conductor is neutral overall, the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q, so the total charge is zero. Therefore, the field outside should be as if a point charge +q is at the center.

But then why is the position of the charge inside the cavity (the position of l and theta) given? Maybe I'm missing something here. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the cavity's position affects the electric field inside the conductor? Wait, but the conductor's material doesn't allow electric fields inside it. The charges redistribute on the surfaces. The inner surface has induced charges, but the outer surface has +q. So regardless of where the charge q is placed inside the cavity, the outer surface remains with a uniform distribution of +q. Because the conductor's symmetry would require that the outer surface's charge remains uniformly distributed.

Wait, but when the charge q is placed in the cavity, which is off-center (since the center of the cavity is separated by s from the conductor's center), does that affect the distribution of the outer charge? Hmm. If the cavity is off-center, then the induced charges on the inner surface would not be uniformly distributed. Wait, no. Wait, in a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the conductor is zero. The charges on the inner surface are induced by the charge q in the cavity. But since the cavity is a spherical cavity, even if it's off-center, the charges on the inner surface would adjust to cancel the electric field inside the conductor. But the outer surface's charge is still +q, uniformly distributed.

Wait, but if the cavity is off-center, would the outer surface's charge distribution still be uniform? Because the conductor is a sphere, so the outer surface is a sphere. If the charge inside the cavity is off-center, the induced charges on the inner surface would be a non-uniform distribution, but the outer surface's induced charge (which is +q) would still be uniformly distributed because the outer surface is a conductor and the charges would distribute themselves to minimize energy, which for a spherical conductor, would be uniform. Wait, but the outer surface is a sphere, so even if the charges inside the cavity are off-center, the outer surface's charge would still be uniformly distributed. Because the outer surface is a spherical shell, and its charge distribution is determined by external fields. But in this case, the external field is due to the charge inside the cavity. But the cavity's charge is inside a conductor, so the conductor's inner surface would have charges that cancel the field within the conductor. The outer surface's charge is +q, and its distribution is uniform because the conductor is a sphere. So the outer surface's charge is uniformly distributed, so the electric field outside would still be as if the charge +q is at the center.

But then why is the position of the charge inside the cavity (l and theta) given? Maybe I'm missing something here. Let's think again.

Wait, the problem states that the charge is placed inside the cavity. The cavity's center is at a distance s from the conductor's center. So the charge is inside the cavity, which is a sphere of radius r, so it's within the conductor. The conductor itself is a sphere of radius R, so the charge is somewhere inside the conductor (but wait, no, the conductor is a solid sphere, so the cavity is hollow inside it. So the charge is inside the cavity, which is a hollow part of the conductor. So the conductor's material is only between the inner radius (r) and the outer radius (R). So the charge is inside the cavity, which is inside the conductor's material. Wait, no. Wait, the conductor is uncharged, so the cavity is empty except for the charge placed inside it. The conductor is a shell with inner radius r and outer radius R. The charge +q is inside the cavity (radius r), so the cavity's radius is smaller than R. But the conductor's material is between r and R.

But the key point is that the conductor's inner surface has induced charges. The charge inside the cavity (the +q) induces a -q charge on the inner surface. Then, the conductor is neutral overall, so the outer surface must have a +q charge. The distribution of the outer surface's charge is uniform because the conductor is a sphere, so the electric field outside the conductor (which is a sphere of radius R) would be as if all the +q charge is concentrated at the center. Therefore, the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor at a distance L, should be E = (1/(4πε₀))*(q)/L². That's option A.

But wait, the problem mentions the position of the charge inside the cavity (distance l from the center of the cavity, angle theta). Does that affect the electric field at point P? Let me think. If the charge is not at the center of the cavity, then the induced charges on the inner surface of the conductor would be non-uniform. But the outer surface's charge would still be +q, uniformly distributed, right? Because the conductor is a sphere, so the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform regardless of the position of the charge inside the cavity. The electric field outside depends only on the total charge on the outer surface. So even if the charge inside the cavity is off-center, the outer surface's charge remains uniformly distributed, leading to the same electric field as if the charge were at the center.

Wait, but is that correct? Let me think about this. Suppose we have a conductor with a cavity, and the cavity has a charge off-center. The conductor's inner surface will have induced charges arranged to cancel the field inside the conductor. But the outer surface's induced charge is determined by the total charge on the conductor. Since the conductor is neutral, the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q. But the distribution of the outer surface's charge would still be uniform because the conductor is a sphere. So the electric field outside the conductor would still be as if the charge +q is at the center. Therefore, the position of the charge inside the cavity (l and theta) does not affect the electric field outside the conductor. So the answer should be option A.

But let me consider another approach. Suppose we use the method of images. For a point charge inside a spherical cavity in a conductor, maybe we can model the induced charges using image charges. But in this case, since the cavity is a sphere, the image charge would be at the center of the cavity. Wait, but the cavity's center is offset from the conductor's center. So if we have a charge q at a point inside the cavity, which is offset from the conductor's center, then perhaps the image charge would be at the center of the cavity. But since the conductor is neutral, the image charge would be -q, and the outer surface would have +q. But then the electric field outside would be the same as if the +q is at the center. Because the image charge would be at the center of the cavity, which is a distance s from the conductor's center. But the conductor's outer surface is a sphere of radius R, so the image charge is inside the conductor. Wait, but the conductor is a sphere, so if the image charge is inside the conductor, that would mean the conductor has a charge inside it, which would affect the electric field inside the conductor. But the conductor is a conductor, so the electric field inside it (and the cavity) must be zero. Therefore, the image charge idea might not directly apply here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is similar to a spherical capacitor. But in a spherical capacitor, you have two concentric shells. Here, the conductor is a single shell with a cavity. The charge is inside the cavity. The electric field outside the conductor is determined by the outer charge. So regardless of where the charge is inside the cavity, the outer charge is +q, and the field outside is as if the charge were at the center. Therefore, the answer should be option A.

But wait, the options don't have a term with L squared. Option C is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². So that's the same as option A. Wait, are options A and C the same? Let me check:

Option A: (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L²

Option C: (1/(4πε₀)) * q / l²

Wait, so A is q over L squared, and C is q over l squared. So if L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P, which is greater than R, and l is the distance from P to the center of the cavity, which is greater than R (since l, L > R). So L is different from l. Therefore, why would the answer be A or C?

But according to the reasoning earlier, the electric field outside the conductor is due to the outer charge of +q, which is uniformly distributed on the outer surface. Therefore, the electric field at P should be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/L². So that's option A.

But then why is there an option C with l squared? Maybe I'm missing something here. Let me think again.

Wait, the conductor's outer surface is a sphere of radius R. The point P is located at a distance L from the center of the conductor. So regardless of where P is located on the outer surface (i.e., the sphere of radius R), the electric field due to a point charge at the center would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/L². Therefore, the position of the charge inside the cavity (l and theta) doesn't affect the electric field at P. So the answer should be A.

But let me verify this with another approach. Let's consider the superposition principle. The total electric field at P is the sum of the electric fields due to all charges in the system. The charges in the system are: the uncharged conductor (which has induced charges on its inner and outer surfaces), and the point charge +q inside the cavity.

The induced charges on the inner surface of the conductor are -q. The induced charges on the outer surface are +q. The electric field at P due to the inner surface charge (-q) would be zero because the conductor's material is between the inner and outer surfaces, and the charges on the inner surface produce a field inside the conductor, which is zero. Therefore, the electric field at P due to the inner surface is zero. The electric field at P due to the outer surface charge (+q) is as if all the charge were concentrated at the center, so E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/L². The electric field at P due to the point charge +q inside the cavity: since the cavity is a hollow space inside the conductor, the electric field at P due to the +q charge would be as if it's in free space. But wait, no. The +q charge is inside the cavity, and the conductor is uncharged. The conductor's inner surface has induced charges (-q) to cancel the field of +q inside the conductor. Therefore, the electric field at P due to the +q charge would be zero inside the conductor. But P is outside the conductor. Wait, but the +q charge is inside the cavity. The electric field at P due to the +q charge would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(r²), where r is the distance between P and the +q charge. But in this case, the distance between P and the +q charge is l, since l is the distance from P to the center of the cavity, and the center of the cavity is separated by s from the conductor's center. Wait, but the point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and l is the distance from P to the center of the cavity. So the distance between P and the +q charge is not l, but something else. Wait, no. If the center of the cavity is at a distance s from the conductor's center, and the point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, then the distance between P and the center of the cavity is sqrt(L² + s² - 2 L s cosθ), by the law of cosines. But that's the distance between P and the center of the cavity. The charge +q is at the center of the cavity, so the distance from P to the +q is sqrt(L² + s² - 2 L s cosθ). But the problem states that l is the distance from P to the center of the cavity, so l = sqrt(L² + s² - 2 L s cosθ). But that complicates things. So the electric field due to the +q charge at P would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(l²). But then there's also the electric field due to the outer surface charge (+q) at P. But the outer surface's charge is uniformly distributed, so the field due to that is E_outer = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/L². But wait, the outer surface's charge is +q, so the field outside is as if it's at the center. However, the +q charge inside the cavity also contributes to the field. But the conductor's material is uncharged, so the net charge on the conductor is zero. Therefore, the total electric field at P would be the sum of the electric field due to the outer surface charge (E_outer) and the electric field due to the +q charge inside the cavity (E_cavity). But since the conductor's inner surface is -q, which is induced by the +q charge, the field inside the conductor due to the inner surface is zero. However, the field outside the conductor due to the outer surface is E_outer. The field due to the +q charge inside the cavity is E_cavity = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(l²). But wait, the conductor's material is a conductor, so the presence of the +q charge inside the cavity would create an electric field inside the conductor, which is canceled by the induced -q charge on the inner surface. However, the field outside the conductor is due to the outer surface's +q charge. Therefore, the total electric field at P is the sum of E_outer and E_cavity. But since the conductor is neutral, the outer surface's charge is +q, but the inner surface's charge is -q. However, the point P is outside the conductor, so the field there is due to the outer surface's +q. The field due to the +q charge inside the cavity is at a distance l from P. Therefore, the total electric field at P would be E_total = E_outer + E_cavity = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/L² + (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(l²). But this can't be right because the options don't have such a combination. The options either have L² or l². So perhaps I made a mistake here.

Alternatively, maybe the electric field due to the +q charge inside the cavity is canceled by the conductor's response. Wait, but the conductor's inner surface has induced -q, which cancels the field of the +q inside the cavity within the conductor. However, outside the conductor, the field due to the +q charge is still present. But the conductor's outer surface has +q, which would produce a field outside. However, the field due to the +q charge in the cavity and the field due to the conductor's outer surface charge (+q) might combine. Wait, but the conductor's outer surface charge is a separate +q, not the same as the +q in the cavity. The +q in the cavity is inside the conductor, so the conductor's inner surface is induced to -q, and the outer surface is induced to +q. Therefore, the electric field outside the conductor is due to the +q on the outer surface. The +q charge in the cavity is inside the conductor, so its electric field inside the conductor is canceled by the conductor's inner surface. Therefore, the electric field outside the conductor is only due to the outer surface's +q. Therefore, the field at P is (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/L². So option A.

But then why is option C there? It uses l squared. So perhaps the confusion comes from whether the point P is affected by the +q charge in the cavity. Since the conductor's inner surface cancels the field of the +q inside the conductor, the field outside is due to the outer surface's +q. The +q in the cavity is inside the conductor, so its field is canceled inside the conductor. However, the point P is outside the conductor, so the field at P due to the +q in the cavity would be (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(l²). But since the conductor's outer surface has a +q charge, the field outside is due to that as well as the cavity's +q. But the conductor's outer surface's +q is in addition to the +q in the cavity. Wait, no. The +q in the cavity is inside the conductor, so the outer surface's +q is a separate charge. Therefore, the total electric field at P would be the sum of the electric fields due to the outer surface's +q and the cavity's +q. But the cavity's +q is inside the conductor, so the field due to it at P is (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(l²). However, the conductor's outer surface's +q produces a field of (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/L². Therefore, the total field would be the sum of these two fields. But none of the options have a sum. So perhaps the correct answer is option A, as the outer surface's field dominates, or perhaps there's a different consideration.

Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the cavity's charge is negligible compared to the conductor's outer surface charge. Since the conductor is neutral, its inner surface has -q and outer surface has +q. The cavity's +q is a small charge compared to the conductor's outer surface charge. Therefore, the electric field at P is primarily due to the outer surface's +q, which is (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/L². So option A.

But wait, the problem states that the conductor is uncharged. Therefore, the total charge on the conductor is zero. The inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q. So the outer surface's charge is +q. Therefore, the electric field outside the conductor is as if a charge +q is at the center. Therefore, the field at P is (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/L². So option A.

But then why is the problem giving options with l and theta? Maybe the problem is trying to trick me into thinking that the cavity's position affects the field. But as reasoned earlier, the field outside the conductor is due to the outer surface's charge, which is uniformly distributed, so the position of the charge inside the cavity doesn't affect the field outside. Therefore, the answer should be option A.

Wait, but another way to think about it: if the cavity's charge is inside the conductor, then the conductor's inner surface will have induced charges. However, the outer surface's charge is +q, which is uniformly distributed. Therefore, the electric field outside the conductor is due to this +q. The position of the charge inside the cavity (l and theta) doesn't affect the outer surface's charge distribution, so the field outside remains the same as if the charge were at the center. Therefore, the answer is option A.

But let me check the problem statement again. The conductor is uncharged, so the total charge on the conductor is zero. The inner surface has -q, the outer surface has +q. The point P is outside the conductor, at a distance L from the center. The electric field there is due to the outer surface's +q. Therefore, E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/L². So option A.

But why is there an option C with l squared? Maybe I'm missing something. Let's think again. Suppose the charge inside the cavity is +q, and the conductor's inner surface is -q. The outer surface is +q. The field at P due to the outer surface is (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/L². The field at P due to the inner surface (which is -q) would be zero inside the conductor, but outside the conductor, the field due to the inner surface's charge would be as if it's at the center. Wait, but the inner surface's charge is distributed on the inner surface, which is a sphere of radius r. The point P is outside the conductor, so the distance from P to the inner surface's charges would vary. But since the inner surface is a sphere, the field outside due to the inner surface's charges would be zero. Because the conductor's inner surface's charges (if they were all at the center) would produce a field inside the conductor, which is zero. But in reality, the inner surface's charges are distributed on the inner sphere. However, since the conductor's material is in between the inner and outer surfaces, the field due to the inner surface's charges inside the conductor is zero. But outside the conductor, the field due to the inner surface's charges would be the same as if they were concentrated at the center. But since the inner surface's total charge is -q, the field outside the conductor due to the inner surface's charges would be E_inner = (1/(4πε₀)) * (-q)/L². But then the field due to the outer surface is E_outer = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/L². The total field at P would be E_total = E_outer + E_inner = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q - q)/L² = 0. But that can't be right, because the conductor is neutral, so the net field should be zero. But this contradicts the fact that the conductor's outer surface has a charge +q, which should produce a field outside. Wait, but the conductor's outer surface is a sphere of radius R, so the field outside due to it is as if the charge +q is at the center. The inner surface's charges are on a sphere of radius r, but the point P is outside the conductor, so the distance from P to the inner surface's charges varies. However, since the inner surface's charges are on a sphere, the field outside due to them would be as if they were at the center. Therefore, the inner surface's charges produce E_inner = (1/(4πε₀)) * (-q)/L². The outer surface's charges produce E_outer = (1/(4π₀)) * (q)/L². The total field is E_total = E_outer + E_inner = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q - q)/L² = 0. But that's impossible because the conductor's outer surface has a charge +q, which should create a field outside. Therefore, this reasoning must be flawed.

Wait, the mistake here is assuming that the inner surface's charges produce a field outside the conductor. But the inner surface's charges are on a sphere of radius r, and the point P is outside the conductor (radius R). So the distance from P to the inner surface's charges is at least (L - r). However, the conductor's inner surface's charges are on a sphere, so the field outside the conductor due to the inner surface's charges would be as if they were all at the center. Therefore, the inner surface's charges produce E_inner = (1/(4πε₀)) * (-q)/L². The outer surface's charges produce E_outer = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/L². So the total field is zero. But that's impossible because the conductor's outer surface has a charge +q, which should create a field outside. Therefore, the error in this reasoning is that the inner surface's charges are on a sphere of radius r, so their field outside the conductor is not as if they were at the center. The conductor's inner surface is a sphere, but the point P is outside the conductor, so the distance from P to the inner surface's charges is not L, but something else. Wait, but the conductor's inner surface is a sphere of radius r, and the point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center. The distance from P to the inner surface's charges (which are on a sphere of radius r) would be sqrt(L² + r² - 2 L r cosθ'), where θ' is the angle between P and the inner surface's charges. But since the inner surface's charges are uniformly distributed, the average field outside due to them would be zero. Because the charges are symmetrically distributed on the inner sphere, their contributions to the field outside would cancel out. Therefore, the field outside due to the inner surface's charges is zero. Therefore, the total field outside the conductor is only due to the outer surface's +q charge, which is (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/L². Therefore, the answer is option A.

But then why is the problem providing options with l and theta? Maybe the problem is trying to test whether the position of the cavity's charge affects the field outside. But as shown above, the field outside the conductor is due to the outer surface's charge, which is uniformly distributed, so the position of the cavity's charge inside the conductor doesn't affect the field outside. Therefore, the answer should be option A.

But let me check another angle. Suppose the cavity's charge is not at the center. Then, when the conductor is placed in an external electric field, the induced charges would be asymmetric. But in this problem, there is no external electric field. The conductor is placed in the field created by the charge inside the cavity. So the conductor's inner surface will have induced charges, but the outer surface's charge is still +q, uniformly distributed. Therefore, the field outside the conductor is due to the +q on the outer surface, regardless of the position of the charge inside the cavity. Therefore, the answer is option A.

Therefore, after considering all these factors, the correct answer is option A.
</think>

The problem involves a spherical conductor of radius \( R \), with an uncharged cavity of radius \( r \) and center separated by a distance \( s \) from the conductor's center. A small positive charge \( +q \) is placed inside the cavity, and the task is to determine the electric field \( \vec{E} \) at a point \( P \) outside the conductor, located at a distance \( L \) from the center of the conductor (\( L, L > R \)).

### Key Analysis:

1. **Conductor and Cavity Setup**:
   - The conductor is neutral overall but develops charge distributions on its surfaces in response to the cavity's charge.
   - The cavity's charge \( +q \) induces a charge \( -q \) on the inner surface of the conductor to maintain electrostatic equilibrium inside the conductor.
   - The outer surface of the conductor must then have a charge \( +q \) to ensure the conductor's net charge is zero.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**:
   - The electric field outside the conductor depends only on the charges on its outer surface. Since the outer surface has a uniformly distributed charge \( +q \), the electric field outside the conductor behaves as if all the charge \( +q \) were concentrated at the center of the conductor.
   - The distance \( L \) is the distance from the center of the conductor to the point \( P \). Therefore, the electric field at \( P \) is determined by the formula for a point charge: 
     \[
     E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
     \]

3. **Relevance of \( l \) and \( \theta \)**:
   - The problem introduces \( l \) (the distance between \( P \) and the center of the cavity) and \( \theta \) (the angle between \( l \) and \( s \)) to potentially test whether the position of the charge inside the cavity affects the electric field outside the conductor.
   - However, the conductor's outer surface charge \( +q \) is uniformly distributed, and the electric field outside the conductor is determined solely by this charge. The position of the charge inside the cavity does not influence the field outside the conductor, as the induced charges on the inner surface cancel the field within the conductor, leaving only the outer surface's charge to determine the external field.

4. **Critical Evaluation of Options**:
   - **Option A**: \( E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2} \)  
     This correctly represents the electric field at \( P \), as it accounts for the outer surface charge \( +q \) and the distance \( L \).
   - **Option B**: \( E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{(l+s \cos\theta)^2} \)  
     This incorrectly incorporates \( l \) and \( \theta \), which are irrelevant to the external field. The position of the charge inside the cavity does not affect the field outside the conductor.
   - **Option C**: \( E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{l^2} \)  
     This incorrectly uses \( l \), the distance from \( P \) to the cavity's center, instead of the distance \( L \) from the conductor's center to \( P \). This is not relevant to the external field.
   - **Option D**: \( E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{(l-s \cos\theta)^2} \)  
     Similar to Option B, this incorrectly incorporates \( l \) and \( \theta \), which are irrelevant to the external field.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option A**, as the electric field outside the conductor is determined solely by the uniformly distributed charge \( +q \) on the outer surface, and the distance \( L \) from the conductor's center to the point \( P \).

ANSWER: A
