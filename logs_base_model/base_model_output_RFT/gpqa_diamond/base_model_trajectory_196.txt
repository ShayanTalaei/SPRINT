Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's start by breaking down the information given. The compound is Compound X, and it's reacting with red phosphorus and HI. The question is asking for the final product after this reaction. The options are A, B, C, or D. Let me think through this step by step.

First, let me look at the spectroscopic data provided. The IR data shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad peak, probably from an O-H stretch. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which could indicate a carbonyl group, like a ketone or maybe an ester. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be due to conjugated double bonds or aromatic rings. 

Looking at the 1H NMR data: 

- 10.5 ppm is a triplet or maybe a singlet? Wait, it's written as bs (broad singlet) with 1H. A broad peak around 10-12 ppm usually suggests an aldehyde proton. But wait, the question mentions that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Red phosphorus typically reacts with alcohols to form phosphorus compounds, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a Grignard reaction? Wait, but Grignard reagents are usually Mg, not phosphorus. Hmm.

Wait, red phosphorus and HI... I think when an alcohol reacts with triphenylphosphine and HI, it forms an alkyl phosphonium salt, which might then react further under certain conditions. But maybe the reaction here is forming a phosphorus compound, but the question is about the product after this reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the initial compound has an -OH group, which would react with phosphorus and HI to form a phosphine oxide. But I'm not entirely sure. Let's think again.

Wait, the IR has a broad peak around 3400-2500 cm-1, which is typical for an -OH group. So Compound X probably has an alcohol group. The 1720 cm-1 peak suggests a carbonyl, maybe an ester or ketone. Let's look at the NMR.

In the 1H NMR:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): Broad singlet, likely an aldehyde proton. But the IR also has a broad peak, which could be an -OH. Wait, but if there's an aldehyde, the proton would be around 9-10 ppm, but maybe it's a different situation. Alternatively, maybe the aldehyde is part of a conjugated system or some other group.

Wait, but the IR shows 1720 cm-1, which is strong for a carbonyl, maybe an ester or ketone. Let's see. The NMR also has a triplet at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which might be a methyl group attached to something. Then there's a 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) and 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). Let's try to piece this together.

The aromatic region shows 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). So that's a para-substituted benzene ring, perhaps. The 8.0 ppm is a doublet, which suggests coupling with another proton. Similarly, the 7.2 ppm is another doublet. So the substituents on the benzene are in the para positions. Let's think about the substituents. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a methine group next to an oxygen, maybe. Then the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a triplet of protons, which might be a CH2CH3 group. Wait, no, a triplet at 1.4 ppm with 3H? Wait, 3H as a triplet would be a -CH2CH2- group? Or maybe a -CH2CH3 group where the adjacent group is splitting it. Wait, the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) is a multiplet for 2H. Let's try to draw the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzene ring has a substituent with an ester group. Let's consider the NMR. The 10.5 ppm is a singlet for 1H, but if it's an aldehyde, that would be around 9-10 ppm. Wait, but the IR shows a broad peak around 3400-2500, which is typical for an -OH (alcohol or phenol). So maybe the aldehyde is not present. Wait, but 10.5 ppm is a triplet? Wait, no, the question says it's a broad singlet. So maybe an acidic proton like a phenolic -OH. Let me check the IR again. The IR has 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad peak, so that's probably an -OH group. So maybe the compound is a phenol. Then the 1720 cm-1 is a carbonyl group. So perhaps the compound is a phenol with an ester group or a carbonyl group attached.

So, if the structure is a 4-methylphenyl group with an ester substituent, maybe. Let me try to reconstruct the structure.

The aromatic region: two doublets at 8.0 ppm (2H) and 7.2 ppm (2H). That suggests a para-substituted benzene. So the substituent is in the para position relative to another group. Wait, but how many substituents are there? Let's see. The 1H NMR shows 10.5 ppm (1H), which might be an aldehyde, but if it's a phenol, that might not fit. Wait, but if the aldehyde proton is at 10.5 ppm, but the IR shows a broad peak at 3400-2500, which would be an -OH. So maybe the compound has both an aldehyde and a phenol group. But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is not present, and the 10.5 ppm is something else. Wait, but 10.5 ppm is a very downfield shift. Aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm, but maybe if there's some conjugation or electron-withdrawing groups, the shift could be higher. Alternatively, maybe it's a different proton.

Wait, another thought: The 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) could be a methyl ester's oxygen adjacent proton? Wait, no, esters typically have carbonyl protons around 170-175 ppm. Wait, but the 1720 cm-1 peak in IR is a strong carbonyl. So maybe the compound has an ester group. Let's think. An ester would have a carbonyl around 1720 cm-1. The 10.5 ppm could be an aldehyde, but maybe it's a ketone? No, ketones are usually around 205-225 ppm in 13C NMR. Wait, but this is 1H NMR. Wait, the 1720 cm-1 is a strong signal, but for 1H NMR, the carbonyl proton (if any) would be around 170-180 ppm. Wait, but the 10.5 ppm is 1H. Wait, maybe it's not a carbonyl, but an aldehyde or ketone. Wait, this is confusing. Let me check again.

Wait, the 1H NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad singlet. That's a very downfield shift. Aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm. But maybe if there's an electron-withdrawing group, the aldehyde could be deshielded more. Alternatively, maybe it's a different type of proton. Wait, another possibility: the 10.5 ppm is an aldehyde proton. But then the IR would show a strong absorption around 2720 cm-1 (for aldehyde C-H stretch). But the IR given here doesn't mention that. Wait, the IR data given is: 3400–2500 cm-1 (broad), 1720, 1610, 1450. So maybe the aldehyde's C-H is not present here. So maybe the 10.5 ppm is not an aldehyde. Then what else could it be?

Wait, perhaps the 10.5 ppm is an acidic proton. For example, a phenolic -OH. But wait, phenolic -OH protons are usually around 5 ppm, but they can be broad and appear as a broad peak. Wait, but 10.5 ppm is quite downfield. Wait, maybe it's not a phenol. Alternatively, maybe it's a carboxylic acid proton, but those are usually around 12-13 ppm as a broad peak. Wait, the IR shows a peak at 3400-2500, which is broad. If the compound has a carboxylic acid group, the IR would show a broad peak around 2500-3300 cm-1, which matches. But in the 1H NMR, a carboxylic acid proton would be a broad peak around 12-13 ppm. The 10.5 ppm is a singlet, so maybe it's not a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde. Wait, but I'm confused now.

Alternatively, maybe the 10.5 ppm is a methyl ester's oxygen adjacent proton. Wait, methyl esters typically have the OCH3 group around 3.6-3.8 ppm. The 10.5 ppm is way downfield. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, like in an ether. But methylene adjacent to oxygen is usually around 3-4 ppm. Wait, maybe it's a different group.

Alternatively, maybe the 10.5 ppm is a proton that's part of a conjugated system. For example, in an aromatic ring with substituents that deshield the proton. But I'm not sure. Let's try to focus on the aromatic region first.

The aromatic signals: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). So that's a para-substituted benzene. The substituents are in the para positions. Let's consider that. So the benzene ring has two substituents in the para positions. Let's think about what those substituents could be.

The 1H NMR has 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) and 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H), and 2.9 ppm (m, 1H). Let's break that down.

Starting from the downfield: 8.0 ppm is a doublet, so two protons. Then 7.2 ppm is another doublet. The 1.7 ppm is multiplet for 2H. The 1.4 ppm is a triplet (t) for 3H, which suggests a CH2CH3 group. The 0.9 ppm is a triplet (t) for 3H, which is probably a CH3CH2 group.

Putting that together, maybe the benzene ring has a substituent that includes an ester group. For example, a benzene ring with a substituent like OCH2CH2COOR. Let's see. Wait, but maybe the substituent is a propyl group attached via an oxygen. Let's think. For example, a structure like Ph-O-CH2-CH2-CO-O-R. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on the benzene are a methyl group and an ester group. Let me try to sketch a possible structure.

Suppose the benzene ring has two substituents: one is a methyl group, and the other is an ester group. Let's say the substituents are in the para positions. So the benzene ring has a -CH3 and an -OOCR group in the para positions. Wait, but then the NMR would show signals from those substituents.

Wait, the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a triplet? Wait, no. Wait, 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a doublet for 3H. That suggests a CH2CH3 group. For example, a -CH2CH3 attached to something. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a triplet for 3H, which is another CH2CH3 group. Wait, but that would be two CH2CH3 groups? Or maybe one CH2CH3 and another CH3.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent on the benzene is a propyl group. Let's think. If the benzene has a -OCH2CH2COOR group, then the CH2CH2 would appear around 1.4 ppm as a triplet? Wait, maybe not. Let me think about the splitting. If there's a -OCH2CH2COO- group attached to the benzene, the CH2 groups would be adjacent. The first CH2 (next to oxygen) would be split by the adjacent CH2. So the OCH2-CH2- would have the first CH2 as a triplet (because adjacent to the CH2), and the second CH2 as a triplet as well. Wait, but the NMR data shows 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). Wait, 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) could be a -CH2CH3 group. For example, a CH2CH3 attached to an oxygen. Let's consider that.

If the benzene ring has a substituent like -OCH2CH2COOR, then the CH2CH3 would be part of the ester group. The ester group would have a carbonyl at 1720 cm-1, which matches the IR. The OCH2CH2 would be around 3.5-4.5 ppm, but the given data has a peak at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which might be something else.

Wait, the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen. For example, in a structure like -OCH2CH2COOR, the -OCH2- would have protons around 3.5-4 ppm, but maybe in this case, it's splitting into a multiplet. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH2COOR group, but attached to the benzene. Let me try to piece this together.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH2COO- group attached to the benzene. Then the CH2CH2 would have protons at around 3.5 ppm, but the given data shows 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which might not match. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2COOR group. Let's see.

Wait, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a -CH2COOR group and a -CH2CH3 group. Let's try that. The benzene ring would have substituents in the para positions. So, for example, para-substituted with -CH2COOR and -CH2CH3. Let's see how the NMR would look.

The aromatic protons would be in the para positions, so the substitution pattern would cause the aromatic protons to split into two doublets. The downfield protons would be the ones closer to the electrondonating groups. For example, if the substituents are electron-withdrawing (like -COOR), the adjacent protons would be deshielded and appear downfield. But in the given data, the aromatic protons are at 7.2 and 8.0 ppm. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are electron-donating, like -OCH3. Wait, but there's no OCH3 in the substituents. Wait, the NMR shows a 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), which might be a -CH2CH3 group, and a 0.9 ppm (t, 3H), which is a -CH2CH2- group. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with two substituents: one is a -CH2CH2COOR group and the other is a -CH3 group. Let's see. The benzene would have a methyl group and a -CH2CH2COOR group in para positions. Then the aromatic protons would be a doublet (8.0 ppm) and another doublet (7.2 ppm). The substituents would cause the protons adjacent to them to split into different regions.

The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be the two protons on the -CH2- group of the -CH2CH2COOR substituent. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) would be the -CH2CH3 group. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) would be another -CH2CH3 group? Wait, but that would mean two -CH2CH3 groups. But the NMR shows only one -CH2CH3 group (0.9 ppm). Wait, no, the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a triplet, which suggests a -CH2CH2- group. Wait, but a triplet would come from coupling with two neighboring protons. For example, in a -CH2CH2- group, the protons on the CH2 would be split by the adjacent CH2. So the first CH2 (adjacent to the benzene) would be a triplet, and the second CH2 (adjacent to the next CH2 or oxygen) would be a triplet as well. But the given data has 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH2- group attached to an oxygen. For example, -O-CH2CH2-COOR. Then the CH2CH2 would have protons at around 3.5-4 ppm, but the given data shows 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) and 1.7 ppm (m, 2H). Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2COOR group. Let's consider that.

If the substituent is -CH2COOR, then the CH2 would be at around 3.5 ppm, but the given data shows 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which is lower. Hmm. Maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH2COOR group. Then the CH2CH2 would be split into two doublets. The first CH2 (adjacent to the benzene) would be a triplet, and the second CH2 (adjacent to the COO-) would be a triplet as well. But the given data shows 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). Wait, 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) could be a -CH2CH3 group. Then the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) could be another -CH2CH3 group. But how does that fit into the substituent?

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-O-CH2-CH2-COOR group. That would make a longer chain. But that seems complicated. Let me think again.

Another approach: the IR shows a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl. The 3400-2500 cm-1 is a broad peak, which could be an -OH group. So the molecule has both an -OH and a carbonyl group. The 1H NMR shows a broad peak at 10.5 ppm, which is likely an aldehyde proton. Wait, but earlier I thought that might not fit the IR data. Let's check again.

If there's an aldehyde group, the IR would have a strong absorption around 2720 cm-1 (C-H stretch of the aldehyde). But the IR data provided doesn't mention this. However, maybe the aldehyde is not in the structure. Alternatively, the broad peak at 3400-2500 cm-1 could be an -OH group, which is more likely. So the molecule has an -OH and a carbonyl group. Let's assume that.

So the structure could be a phenol with an ester substituent. Let's consider that. For example, a benzene ring with a hydroxyl group and an ester group in para positions. The ester group would have a carbonyl at 1720 cm-1. The -OH would show up as a broad peak in the IR. The NMR would then show aromatic protons, the ester's oxygen adjacent protons, and the ester's methyl groups.

In the 1H NMR, the aromatic protons would be as discussed before. The ester group would have a -O-CO-O-R? Wait, no. Let's clarify. An ester group is typically R-O-CO-R'. So the oxygen adjacent to the carbonyl is part of the ester. The protons on the oxygen would be in the 3.5-4 ppm range. But in the given data, the peaks are at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). So perhaps the ester is part of a longer chain.

Wait, the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a methyl group adjacent to the oxygen. For example, in a structure like -O-CH2CH2COOR, the -CH2CH2 would have protons that split into different regions. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) could be a -CH2CH3 group, and the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) could be another -CH2CH3 group. Wait, but that would require two -CH2CH3 groups, which might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2COOR group. Let's say the benzene ring has a -CH2COOR group and a -OH group in para positions. The -CH2COOR would have a carbonyl at 1720 cm-1. The -OH would show up in the IR as a broad peak. The 1H NMR would then have aromatic protons, the -CH2COOR would have protons at around 3.5 ppm, but the given data shows lower ppm values. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be part of the -CH2COOR group. Wait, but the -CH2COOR would have two protons (on the CH2), which would be split by the adjacent carbonyl. So maybe the -CH2- group would show as a triplet around 3.5 ppm. But in the given data, the highest non-aromatic peak is 2.9 ppm. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH2COOR group. Then the -CH2CH2 would have protons at around 3.5 ppm, but the given data shows lower. Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH2COOR group, but attached to the benzene. Then the CH2CH2 would have protons at around 3.5 ppm. However, the given data shows 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which could correspond to a different group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH2 group attached to the benzene via an oxygen. For example, -O-CH2CH2-. Then the protons on the CH2 would be around 3.5-4 ppm, but the given data shows lower. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH2O- group attached to the benzene. Then the protons on the CH2 would be split into different regions. Let's try to piece this together.

If the benzene ring has a substituent like -O-CH2CH2-COOR, then the protons on the CH2 groups would be around 3.5-4 ppm. However, the given data has 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which is lower. So perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH2 group attached to a carbonyl. For example, -CH2CH2-COOR. Then the protons on the CH2 would be split by the adjacent CH2 and COOR groups. The first CH2 (adjacent to the benzene) would be a triplet (split by the adjacent CH2), appearing around 3.5 ppm. The second CH2 (adjacent to the COOR) would also be a triplet, but maybe downfield. However, the given data shows 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which is lower. So perhaps this isn't the right substituent.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH2-O- group. For example, -CH2CH2-O-COOR. Then the protons on the CH2 would be around 3.5 ppm, but again, the given data shows lower. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH2-O- group attached to the benzene, and the oxygen is part of an ether. Then the protons on the CH2 would be around 3.5 ppm. But the given data shows 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which is lower. So perhaps that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH2- group attached directly to the benzene. Then the protons on the CH2 would be split into different regions. Let's say the substituent is -CH2CH2-, then the first CH2 (adjacent to the benzene) would be a triplet around 2.9 ppm (matching the given data), and the second CH2 would be a triplet around 1.4 ppm (matching the given data). Then the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) could be a -CH2CH3 group. Wait, but that would require another CH3 group. Let me try to sketch this.

If the substituent is -CH2CH2- attached to the benzene, then the protons on the first CH2 (adjacent to the benzene) would be split into a triplet by the adjacent CH2, giving 2.9 ppm (m, 1H). The second CH2 (adjacent to the substituent) would be split by the adjacent CH2 and possibly other groups, giving a multiplet around 1.7 ppm (m, 2H). Then the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) could be a -CH2CH3 group attached elsewhere. Wait, but the substituent is a -CH2CH2- group, so where would the -CH2CH3 come from? Unless there's another substituent. Wait, the aromatic ring has two substituents: one is the -CH2CH2- group, and the other is a -CH3 group in the para position. So the benzene ring has -CH2CH2- and -CH3 in para positions. Then the aromatic protons would be in the doublets as discussed earlier. The substituent -CH2CH2- would have protons at 2.9 ppm (first CH2) and 1.7 ppm (second CH2). The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) could be the -CH3 group. Wait, but the -CH3 would be a singlet, not a doublet. Hmm. Alternatively, the -CH2CH3 group would have a triplet for the CH3. Wait, but the given data has 0.9 ppm (t, 3H), which is a triplet. So if there's a -CH2CH3 group, the CH3 would be a triplet. But in this scenario, the -CH2CH2- group would have the first CH2 as a triplet (2.9 ppm) and the second CH2 as a triplet (1.7 ppm). The -CH3 group would be a singlet, but the given data has a triplet at 0.9 ppm. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH2-O- group attached to the benzene. Then the O would be part of an ether. The protons on the CH2 groups would be split into different regions. Let's see: the first CH2 (adjacent to the benzene) would be a triplet at around 3.5 ppm, but the given data shows 2.9 ppm. The second CH2 (adjacent to the O) would be a triplet at around 1.4 ppm. The OCH2 would have protons around 3.3-3.7 ppm, but the given data doesn't show that. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH2COOR group. Then the protons on the CH2 would be split into different regions. Let's consider that. The first CH2 (adjacent to the benzene) would be a triplet around 3.5 ppm, the second CH2 (adjacent to the COOR) would be a triplet around 1.7 ppm. The COOR would have the OCH2 group, which would be a triplet around 3.3 ppm. But the given data doesn't show that. Hmm.

This is getting complicated. Let me try to summarize what I have so far:

- IR shows a carbonyl (1720 cm-1) and broad -OH (3400-2500).
- 1H NMR shows aromatic protons as doublets (8.0 and 7.2 ppm), suggesting a para-substituted benzene.
- The substituents on the benzene are likely an -OH and a carbonyl group, but how do they fit into the NMR data?

Wait, maybe the compound is a phenol with an ester group. For example, para-hydroxybenzoic acid ester. Let's think. The ester group would be O-CO-O-R. The structure would be Ph-OH and Ph-O-CO-O-R. Wait, but that's not possible. Alternatively, the structure is a benzene ring with a -OH group and an ester substituent in the para position. So, something like para-hydroxybenzyl ester. Wait, maybe the substituent is a -OCH2CH2COOR group.

Wait, let's consider the substituent as -OCH2CH2COOR. Then the structure would be Ph-O-CH2CH2COOR. The aromatic protons would be in the para positions. The substituent -OCH2CH2COOR would have an oxygen adjacent to a CH2, which would have protons around 3.5 ppm. But the given data shows 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which is lower. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH2COOR group attached to the benzene via an oxygen. For example, -O-CH2CH2COOR. Then the protons on the CH2 would be around 3.5 ppm, but again, the given data shows lower.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH2 group attached to the benzene, and the oxygen is part of an ether. So the structure would be Ph-CH2CH2-O-... But then the oxygen would be part of an ether, not an ester. The IR would show a carbonyl if it's an ester. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH2O- group attached to the benzene, and the oxygen is part of a carbonyl. Wait, no, that would require the oxygen to be double-bonded. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet. That's characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (RCOOH), but the IR doesn't show a peak around 2720 cm-1, which would be expected for a C-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde. But earlier I thought the IR didn't support that. Alternatively, maybe the broad peak is an acidic proton, like a phenolic -OH. If the compound has both an aldehyde and a phenolic -OH, but the IR doesn't show the aldehyde C-H stretch. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the aldehyde is part of a conjugated system, so the C-H stretch is not prominent. For example, if the aldehyde is part of an aromatic ring, but that's not common. Alternatively, maybe the aldehyde is part of an ester group, which would make the C-H stretch in the IR. Wait, no, esters have a carbonyl, not an aldehyde.

This is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to piece together the structure step by step.

1. IR has 3400-2500 cm-1: broad, likely -OH (phenol or alcohol) and a carbonyl (ester, ketone, aldehyde).

2. 1H NMR:

   - Aromatic: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). So two doublets, suggesting para-substituted benzene.

   - 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H). Broad singlet. Could be aldehyde, phenolic -OH, or maybe a carboxylic acid (but IR doesn't support that).

   - 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): aromatic protons, likely adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (like ester or carbonyl).

   - 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): aromatic protons, adjacent to an electron-donating group (like -OCH2...).

   - 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): Could be part of a CH2 group in an ester (OCH2CH2...).

   - 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): CH2 group attached to something (maybe OCH2CH3).

   - 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): CH3 group, possibly adjacent to a CH2.

   - 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): CH3 group adjacent to a CH2.

Putting this together, the benzene ring has two substituents in para positions. One substituent is an -OCH2CH2COOR group, and the other is a -CH3 group. Wait, but how does that fit into the NMR data?

Alternatively, the substituents are:

- One substituent: -OCH2CH2COOR (which would have protons at 3.5-4 ppm, but the given data shows lower ppm).

- Another substituent: -CH3 (which would be a singlet at around 1 ppm, but the given data has a triplet at 0.9 ppm).

This doesn't match. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is -OCH2CH2- attached to the benzene, and the oxygen is part of an ether. Then the protons on the CH2 would be around 3.5 ppm, but again, the given data shows lower.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH2- group attached to the benzene via an oxygen. For example, -O-CH2CH2-. Then the protons on the CH2 would be around 3.5 ppm. But the given data shows 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which is lower. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH2- group attached directly to the benzene. Then the first CH2 (adjacent to the benzene) would be a triplet around 2.9 ppm, and the second CH2 (adjacent to the next CH2) would be a triplet around 1.7 ppm. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) could be a -CH2CH3 group attached elsewhere. Wait, but the substituent is a -CH2CH2- group, so where would the -CH2CH3 come from? Unless there's another substituent. But the aromatic ring is para-substituted, so maybe the benzene has two substituents: -CH2CH2- and -CH3 in para positions. Then the aromatic protons would be as discussed.

In that case, the substituents would be:

- -CH2CH2- (as part of the substituent)

- -CH3

So the benzene ring has -CH2CH2- and -CH3 in para positions. The aromatic protons would be the two doublets at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm. The substituent -CH2CH2- would have protons at 2.9 ppm (first CH2) and 1.7 ppm (second CH2). The -CH3 group would be a singlet. But in the given data, the -CH3 would be a singlet, but the given data has a triplet at 0.9 ppm. Hmm. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is -CH2CH2CH2- attached to the benzene. Then the protons would split into different regions. But that seems more complicated.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH2COO- group. Then the protons on the CH2 would be around 3.5-4 ppm. But the given data shows lower. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH2O- group attached to the benzene. Then the protons on the CH2 would be around 3.5 ppm. But again, the given data shows lower.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH2-O- group attached to the benzene, and the oxygen is part of a carbonyl. But that would form an ester. For example, -CH2CH2-O-COOR. Then the protons on the CH2 would be around 3.5 ppm, but the given data shows lower.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH2- group attached to the benzene via an oxygen, and the oxygen is part of an ether. Then the protons on the CH2 would be around 3.5 ppm, but again, the given data shows lower.

This is getting too complicated. Let me try to consider the possible structures from the options.

The options are:

A. 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B. 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

C. 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

D. 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

Wait, let me look at the options again. The options are all benzene derivatives with substituents and either an acid or an ethyl group. But the original IR and NMR data don't seem to match these options. Wait, perhaps the substituent is an acid. Let's see.

Option D: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the benzene has a -COOH group and a -sec-butyl group in the para positions. The IR would show a strong carbonyl peak around 1720 cm-1 (from the -COOH group), which matches. The 1H NMR would have aromatic protons as doublets (para positions). The -COOH would have a broad singlet around 10-12 ppm. The -sec-butyl group would have a triplet for the CH2CH(CH2)2 group.

But wait, the 1H NMR data given doesn't have a peak around 10 ppm. The highest is 8.0 ppm. So option D seems inconsistent with the given data. The IR would show a carbonyl at 1720, which is correct, but the 1H NMR doesn't show a broad peak around 10 ppm. So D is probably not the answer.

Option B: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So the benzene has a -sec-butyl group and a -CH3 in para positions. The aromatic protons would be as discussed (two doublets). The -sec-butyl group would have a triplet for the CH2CH(CH3)2 group. But the given NMR data has a triplet at 1.4 ppm (3H), a multiplet at 1.7 ppm (2H), and a multiplet at 2.9 ppm (1H). This doesn't match the -sec-butyl group's expected shifts. The -sec-butyl would have protons around 1.4 ppm (CH2), 2.0 ppm (CH), and 3.0 ppm (CH3). The given data has 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), and 2.9 ppm (m, 1H). That doesn't align. So B is unlikely.

Option C: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. The benzene has a -isobutyl group and a -CH3 in para positions. The -isobutyl group would have a triplet around 1.4 ppm for the CH2CH(CH3)2 group. The given data has 1.4 ppm (d, 3H). Wait, but isobutyl has a different splitting. An isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH3)2, so the CH2 would be split into a triplet (two adjacent CH3 groups), and the CH would be a triplet. But the given data has 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), which is a doublet. So that doesn't match. Also, the given data has a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which doesn't fit. So C is unlikely.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. The benzene has a -CH2CH2CH2COOH group. The IR would show a carbonyl (1720 cm-1) and a broad -OH (from the carboxylic acid). The 1H NMR would have aromatic protons as doublets. The -CH2CH2CH2COOH would have protons in the lower ppm region. The ethyl group would have a triplet and a quartet. But the given data shows peaks at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). This doesn't match the expected ethyl group splitting. Also, the carboxylic acid would have a broad peak around 12-13 ppm, but the given data's highest peak is 8.0 ppm. So A is unlikely.

Wait, but maybe the substituent is an ester instead of a carboxylic acid. The IR would still show a carbonyl, but the 1H NMR would not have the carboxylic acid peak. Let's reconsider the options with ester groups.

Looking back, the options provided in the question are all benzene derivatives with substituents. But according to the given IR and NMR data, the compound has a carbonyl and an -OH group. However, none of the options have an -OH group. Wait, the options provided are all benzene derivatives without an -OH group. That's confusing. Maybe the original problem had a typo, or I'm misunderstanding the options.

Wait, the options given are:

A. 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B. 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

C. 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

D. 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

Hmm. All options except A and D have a benzene ring with substituents. But according to the IR data, there should be an -OH group (broad peak), which would suggest an alcohol or carboxylic acid. But the options don't have any with -OH. So either there's a mistake in the options, or I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the -OH is part of the substituent on the benzene ring. For example, the substituent could be a phenol group. Let's see. Option B has a -sec-butyl group and a -CH3. No. Option C has an isobutyl and a -CH3. No. Option D has a -sec-butyl and a -COOH. If the substituent is a -COOH, then the IR would show a broad peak around 2500-3400 cm-1 (carboxylic acid O-H), and a strong peak at 1720 cm-1 (carbonyl). The 1H NMR would show aromatic protons, and the -COOH would have a broad peak. But the given data's highest aromatic peak is 8.0 ppm, and the -COOH would appear around 12-13 ppm. The given data doesn't have that. So D is inconsistent.

Option A has a propanoic acid group. The IR would show a broad O-H and a carbonyl. The NMR would have aromatic protons and the -CH2CH2CH2COOH group. The -CH2CH2CH2COOH would have protons around 2.5-3.5 ppm. The given data has a peak at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which could correspond to the last CH2 in the chain. But then the ethyl group (CH2CH3) would have a triplet at around 1.4 ppm. The given data has 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), which is a doublet. That doesn't match. Also, the given data has 0.9 ppm (t, 3H), which would correspond to the CH3 in the ethyl group. But the propanoic acid chain would have CH2CH2COOH, so the middle CH2 would be a triplet around 3.5 ppm, but the given data has 2.9 ppm. So this doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a phenolic -OH group. For example, the benzene ring has a -OH group and a substituent like -CH2CH2COOR. Then the IR would show a broad O-H and a carbonyl. The NMR would have aromatic protons, and the substituent's protons. Let's try this.

If the substituent is -CH2CH2COOCH2CH3, then the chain would have protons at around 3.5-4 ppm. But the given data shows lower. Hmm.

Alternatively, the substituent is -CH2CH2OCH2CH3. Then the protons on the CH2 would be around 3.5 ppm. Again, the given data shows lower.

This is getting too complicated. Let me think again. The key points from the IR and NMR:

- Broad peak around 3400-2500 cm-1: likely an -OH (phenol or alcohol) or a carboxylic acid (but IR would show a peak around 2720 for the C-H stretch, which isn't present here).

- 1720 cm-1: carbonyl (ester, aldehyde, or ketone).

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): broad singlet. Could be an aldehyde or a carboxylic acid. But in the options, there's no aldehyde. Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic proton (like a phenol -OH). But if the substituent is a phenol, the IR would show a broad peak around 3000-3500 cm-1, which the given data shows. The 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet, which is more characteristic of a carboxylic acid or aldehyde. But given the options don't have these, perhaps the compound is a phenol with an ester substituent.

Wait, the options have substituents like ethyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl. If the substituent is an ester group, like -OCH2CH2COOR, but the options don't show that. Alternatively, the substituent is a propyl group.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is D: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Let's check again. The IR would show a carbonyl (1720 cm-1) and a broad O-H (from the carboxylic acid). The 1H NMR would have aromatic protons as doublets (para substituents). The -sec-butyl group would have a triplet at around 1.4 ppm (CH2), a quartet at 2.0 ppm (CH), and a triplet at 3.0ppm (CH3). The carboxylic acid would have a peak around 12-13 ppm (broad). But the given data doesn't show that. So D is unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a phenolic -OH and an ester group. The substituents would be -OH and -OCH2CH2COOR. But the options don't reflect that. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that can't be. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an ethyl group attached to something else.

Wait, looking at option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. The substituent is a propyl group attached to the benzene. The IR would show a carbonyl (from the carboxylic acid) and a broad O-H. The NMR would show aromatic protons and the propyl group's protons. The propyl group would have a triplet at around 1.4 ppm (CH2), a quartet at 2.0 ppm (CH), and a triplet at 3.0ppm (CH3). But the given data shows 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), which could correspond to the middle and end of the propyl group. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) might be the end CH3. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) doesn't match. Also, the carboxylic acid would have a peak around 12-13 ppm. So A is unlikely.

At this point, I'm a bit stuck. The options don't seem to match the given data. However, perhaps the correct answer is none of the options, but since that's not possible, I must have missed something.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an alcohol group. The IR would show a broad peak around 3400-2500 cm-1, and the 1H NMR would have a peak around 1-2 ppm. But the given data has a peak at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), which could be a CH3 group adjacent to an oxygen. But there's no -OH in the options. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an isopropyl group. But the options don't have that. Wait, the given 1H NMR has a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which could be a CH3 group attached to a CH2. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) could be a CH3 adjacent to a CH2. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 group adjacent to another group. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH group. The aromatic protons are the two doublets at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm. So the substituents are -CH2CH2- and -CH3 in the para positions. But the options don't have such a substituent.

Given all this, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options. But since that's not possible, I must have made a mistake in interpreting the NMR data. Let me check once more.

Wait, in the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) → likely an aldehyde or carboxylic acid.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) → aromatic

- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) → aromatic

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) → maybe a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) → maybe a CH2 adjacent to another group

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) → maybe a CH3 adjacent to a CH2

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) → maybe a CH3 group adjacent to a CH2

Putting this together, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH2O- group attached to the benzene. Then the protons on the CH2 would be around 3.5-4 ppm, but the given data shows lower. Alternatively, the substituent is a -CH2CH2COOR group, but again, the protons would be higher.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH2NH2 group, but that's not in the options.

Given the time I've spent and the options provided, I think the correct answer is D: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Even though the 1H NMR doesn't perfectly match, perhaps there's an error in the problem statement. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a sec-butyl group, and the IR and NMR data correspond to that. Let me check again.

If the substituent is -sec-butyl, the NMR would have a triplet at 1.4 ppm (CH2), a quartet at 2.0 ppm (CH), and a triplet at 3.0 ppm (CH3). The given data has 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) and 2.9 ppm (m, 1H). Doesn't match. So D is unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is -CH2CH2CH2CH3 (but that's an ethyl group, which is not in the options). The given data has a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which could be a CH3 group in a -CH2CH2CH3 chain. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) could be the middle CH2, and 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be the end CH2. But the given data has 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) as well. This doesn't fit.

At this point, I'm forced to conclude that none of the options perfectly match the given data, but given the options, the closest would be none of them. However, since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -OCH2CH2CH2CH3 group, but again, not among the options.

After careful consideration, I think the correct answer is D: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, despite the 1H NMR data not perfectly aligning.
