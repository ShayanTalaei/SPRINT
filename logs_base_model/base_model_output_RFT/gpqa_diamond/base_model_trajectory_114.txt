Okay, let's try to figure out this physics problem. So, the question is about an electron and a positron colliding and annihilating into two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured. One is going upper-right, and the other lower-right. We need to find the angle between them. The options are 138°, 172°, 74°, and 96°. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that when a particle and its antiparticle annihilate, they produce two photons. Since the electron and positron are moving along the horizontal axis, their motion is along the x-axis. The problem states their Lorentz factors are 4 and 2 respectively. Lorentz factor (γ) is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so it relates to their velocities. A higher Lorentz factor means higher speed. So the electron moving with γ=4 is moving faster than the positron with γ=2.

But wait, the positron is moving from the right, so if the electron is moving from the left, they are moving towards each other? Or are they moving in the same direction but opposite? Wait, the problem says the electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left, and the positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right. So if they are moving towards each other along the same line (the x-axis), their relative motion would make them collide. But maybe they are moving in opposite directions? Wait, no, the electron is from the left moving to the right, and the positron is from the right moving to the left. Wait, no, the problem says "from the right" for the positron. Wait, maybe the positron is moving to the left? Because if someone is moving "from the right," they might be coming from the right and moving to the left. Similarly, the electron is moving from the left, so maybe moving to the right. So they are moving towards each other along the x-axis. So their initial velocities are in opposite directions. But their Lorentz factors are different, so their speeds are different. The electron (γ=4) is faster than the positron (γ=2). So when they collide, they annihilate into two photons. The photons have the same energy and their directions are upper-right and lower-right. So the angle between them is what we need to find.

Wait, the directions are upper-right and lower-right. So if the x-axis is horizontal, and the y-axis is vertical, then upper-right would be in the first quadrant, and lower-right would be in the fourth quadrant. So the angle between them would be measured from the x-axis. Wait, but the angle between the two photon directions would be the angle between their vectors. So if one is at θ degrees above the x-axis and the other is at φ degrees below the x-axis, the angle between them would be θ + φ. But I need to figure out what those angles are.

Since the problem says the energies of both photons are the same, that tells me that their momenta must have the same magnitude. Because for photons, energy and momentum are related by E = |p|c. So if E1 = E2, then |p1| = |p2|. But their directions are different, so their momenta vectors are different. The total momentum before collision should equal the total momentum after collision, due to conservation of momentum. But wait, the initial particles are an electron and a positron. So their rest masses are the same. The electron has mass m, and the positron has mass m as well (since they are antiparticles). So the total rest mass is 2m. But since they are moving, their total momentum is the sum of their individual momenta.

Wait, but in the lab frame, the electron is moving to the right (from left) with a certain momentum, and the positron is moving to the left (from right) with another momentum. So their momenta are in opposite directions. So when they collide, their total momentum should be the vector sum of their individual momenta. Then, the photons must carry away this total momentum. Since the photons have opposite directions (upper-right and lower-right), their momenta vectors would be in those directions. But their magnitudes must add up to the total initial momentum.

But the problem states that the energies of the photons are the same. So their magnitudes are equal. Let's denote the energy of each photon as E. Then, their momenta are p1 = E/c in the upper-right direction and p2 = E/c in the lower-right direction. The angle between p1 and p2 would be the angle we need to find.

Wait, but the total momentum before collision is the sum of the electron's and positron's momenta. Let's compute the initial momenta.

First, let's compute the velocities of the electron and positron. The Lorentz factor is given by γ = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). For the electron, γ_e = 4, and for the positron, γ_p = 2.

So for the electron (moving to the right, from the left):

v_e = c * sqrt(1 - (1/γ_e²)) = c * sqrt(1 - 1/16) = c * sqrt(15/16) = (sqrt(15)/4)c ≈ 0.968c.

For the positron (moving to the left, from the right):

v_p = c * sqrt(1 - (1/γ_p²)) = c * sqrt(1 - 1/4) = c * sqrt(3/4) = (sqrt(3)/2)c ≈ 0.866c.

But since the positron is moving to the left, its velocity is -v_p in the x-direction. So the total initial momentum in the x-direction is:

p_initial = m_e * γ_e * v_e (to the right) + m_p * γ_p * v_p (to the left). But since m_e = m_p = m (mass of electron), we can write:

p_initial = m [ γ_e * v_e - γ_p * v_p ].

Wait, because the positron's velocity is in the opposite direction. So the positron's momentum is negative. So total initial momentum is:

p_initial = m ( γ_e v_e - γ_p v_p )

We can compute this:

First, compute γ_e v_e:

γ_e = 4, v_e = (sqrt(15)/4)c, so γ_e v_e = 4 * (sqrt(15)/4)c = sqrt(15) c ≈ 3.872c.

Similarly, γ_p v_p:

γ_p = 2, v_p = (sqrt(3)/2)c, so γ_p v_p = 2 * (sqrt(3)/2)c = sqrt(3)c ≈ 1.732c.

So p_initial = m ( sqrt(15)c - sqrt(3)c ) = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

But sqrt(15) ≈ 3.872, sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732, so sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈ 2.140. So p_initial ≈ 2.140 m c.

Wait, but m c is the rest mass energy divided by c. Wait, m is the rest mass of the electron, so m c² is the rest energy. So m c = (m c²)/c = E_rest / c. But maybe we don't need to compute the actual momentum in terms of m and c, but rather in terms of the given Lorentz factors.

Wait, but perhaps we can compute the total initial momentum by considering the relativistic velocities. Alternatively, maybe we can work in units where c=1 to simplify calculations. Let's try that.

Let me set c=1 for simplicity. Then, the velocities are:

v_e = sqrt(1 - 1/γ_e²) = sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.968.

v_p = sqrt(1 - 1/γ_p²) = sqrt(1 - 1/4) = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

Since the positron is moving to the left, its velocity is -v_p. So the total initial momentum (since c=1) is:

p_initial = m_e (γ_e v_e) + m_p (γ_p (-v_p)).

But m_e = m_p = m. So:

p_initial = m [ γ_e v_e - γ_p v_p ].

Compute γ_e v_e:

γ_e = 4, v_e = sqrt(15)/4, so 4 * sqrt(15)/4 = sqrt(15).

Similarly, γ_p v_p = 2 * sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(3).

So p_initial = m [ sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ].

So that's the total initial momentum in the x-direction. The total initial momentum is entirely in the x-direction because the two particles are moving along the x-axis towards each other. Since the problem says the photons have the same energy, their momenta must have the same magnitude. Let's denote the photon's momentum magnitude as p. Since they are moving at upper-right and lower-right directions, their momenta are in the first and fourth quadrants. Let's denote the angles of the photons with respect to the x-axis as θ and -θ (since they are symmetrically placed above and below the x-axis). Wait, but the problem says one is upper-right and the other lower-right, but not necessarily symmetric. However, since the energies are the same, the magnitudes of their momenta are the same. So the angles might not be symmetric, but their magnitudes are the same. Wait, but the problem states that the energies are the same, so |p1| = |p2|. But their directions are upper-right and lower-right. So the momenta vectors are in the first and fourth quadrants, with the same magnitude but different angles.

The total momentum after collision must equal the initial momentum. So the vector sum of the two photon momenta equals the initial momentum vector. Let's denote the two photon momenta as:

p1 = p (cosθ, sinθ)  (upper-right direction)
p2 = p (cosφ, sinφ)  (lower-right direction)

But since they are in opposite vertical directions, maybe φ = -θ? Wait, but the problem says one is upper-right and the other lower-right. So if one is at angle θ above the x-axis, the other would be at angle -θ below the x-axis. But the problem states that one is upper-right and another lower-right. Wait, but "lower-right" could be at any angle below the x-axis. But since their energies are the same, their momenta magnitudes are the same. So perhaps their angles are symmetric with respect to the x-axis. Let's assume that the two photons have angles θ and -θ. Then their x-components would be p cosθ and p cos(-θ) = p cosθ, and their y-components would be p sinθ and p sin(-θ) = -p sinθ. So the total momentum would be:

p_total_x = p cosθ + p cosθ = 2p cosθ
p_total_y = p sinθ - p sinθ = 0

But the initial momentum is entirely in the x-direction, so the y-component must cancel out. Which they do in this symmetric case. The x-component is 2p cosθ, which must equal the initial momentum p_initial. So:

2p cosθ = p_initial

But p_initial is m (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) (with c=1). Wait, but p is the magnitude of each photon's momentum. Since E_photon = |p| c, but since c=1, E = |p|. So E1 = E2 = p. Therefore, p = E.

But wait, the photon's momentum magnitude is p = E/c, but since c=1, p = E. So the momenta of the photons are p1 = (E, 0) + (0, E tanθ) and p2 = (E, 0) + (0, -E tanθ)? Wait, no. Wait, if a photon has energy E and direction at angle θ from the x-axis, its momentum components are (E cosθ, E sinθ). Wait, no, actually, the momentum vector for a photon is (E/c) in the direction of propagation. Since c=1, it's (E cosθ, E sinθ) in 2D. Wait, no, in 2D, a photon moving at angle θ from x-axis has momentum components (p_x, p_y) = (E cosθ, E sinθ), where E is the magnitude of the momentum. But since E = |p|, which is sqrt(p_x² + p_y²) = E. So yes, that's correct.

But in our case, the two photons have the same energy E, so their momenta are:

p1 = (E cosθ, E sinθ)
p2 = (E cosφ, E sinφ)

But the problem states that one is upper-right and the other lower-right. So θ is in the first quadrant (positive y), φ is in the fourth quadrant (negative y). So φ = -θ? If they are symmetric with respect to the x-axis, then yes. Let's assume that. Then p2 = (E cosθ, -E sinθ).

Then the total x-component is E cosθ + E cosθ = 2E cosθ.

The total y-component is E sinθ - E sinθ = 0.

So the total momentum is (2E cosθ, 0). But the initial momentum is (p_initial, 0) where p_initial = m (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Therefore, 2E cosθ = p_initial.

But E is the energy of each photon, which is also equal to |p| (since E = |p| c, but c=1). Wait, but the photon's momentum magnitude is sqrt( (E cosθ)^2 + (E sinθ)^2 ) = E. So yes, E = |p|. Therefore, E = |p|.

But from the energy perspective, the total energy before collision is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron. Wait, no. Wait, the initial energy is the sum of the rest energy plus the kinetic energy. But photons' energy is the sum of the initial energies minus the rest energy of the annihilating particles? Wait, no, the initial energy of the system (electron and positron) is their total relativistic energy. Then, when they annihilate, the energy of the photons must equal the total energy of the system minus the rest energy of the annihilated particles? Wait, no, the rest energy of the electron and positron is 2mc². But the total energy of the system is the sum of their relativistic energies, which includes their kinetic energy plus rest energy. So when they annihilate, all their energy (rest plus kinetic) is converted into the photons. So the total energy of the photons must equal the sum of the relativistic energies of the electron and positron.

But wait, the problem states that the energies of both photons are the same. So each photon has energy E = (sum of relativistic energies of electron and positron)/2.

Wait, but the relativistic energy of a particle is γ m c². So for the electron, E_e = γ_e m c² = 4 m c². For the positron, E_p = γ_p m c² = 2 m c². But the positron is moving in the opposite direction, so its energy is also 2 m c². Wait, but energy is a scalar, so direction doesn't matter. So the total energy of the system is E_total = 4 m c² + 2 m c² = 6 m c². Then, when they annihilate, the total energy is converted into two photons, each with energy E = 3 m c². But wait, the problem states that the energies of the photons are the same. So each photon has energy 3 m c². Therefore, their momenta are p = E/c = 3 m c² / c = 3 m c.

But wait, if c=1, then p = 3 m. So each photon's momentum magnitude is 3 m. Therefore, from the earlier equation:

2E cosθ = p_initial

But E = 3 m, so 2 * 3 m * cosθ = p_initial.

But p_initial is m (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

So:

2 * 3 m * cosθ = m (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))

Divide both sides by m:

6 cosθ = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)

Therefore:

cosθ = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6

Compute the value:

sqrt(15) ≈ 3.872, sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732

So sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈ 3.872 - 1.732 ≈ 2.140

Divide by 6: 2.140 / 6 ≈ 0.3567

So θ ≈ arccos(0.3567) ≈ 69 degrees.

Therefore, the angle between the two photons is 2θ, since one is at +θ and the other at -θ. Wait, but if the angle between them is the total angle from one to the other, then it's 2θ. Wait, if one is at θ above x-axis and the other is at θ below x-axis, the angle between them is 2θ. So 2 * 69 ≈ 138 degrees. But let's compute it more accurately.

Let me compute θ:

cosθ = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6 ≈ (3.87298 - 1.73205)/6 ≈ 2.14093/6 ≈ 0.35682

θ ≈ arccos(0.35682) ≈ 69.0 degrees (since cos(60°)=0.5, cos(75°)=0.2588, so 0.3568 is between 60 and 75. Let's compute more precisely.

Alternatively, use calculator steps:

Compute arccos(0.35682):

We know that cos(60°) = 0.5, cos(65°) ≈ 0.4226, cos(69°) ≈ 0.3584. Wait, cos(69°) ≈ 0.3584, which is very close to 0.3568. So θ ≈ 69 degrees. Therefore, the angle between them is 2θ ≈ 138 degrees. But looking at the options, 138 is option A. But wait, the options are:

A. 138

B. 172

C. 74

D. 96

So 138 is an option. But wait, let me check if this makes sense. The angle between the two photons is 2θ ≈ 138 degrees. But let's verify the calculations again.

First, the initial momentum:

p_initial = m (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ≈ m (3.87298 - 1.73205) ≈ m (2.14093)

Each photon has momentum p = 3 m (since E = 3 m c², but c=1, so p=3 m).

So 2p cosθ = p_initial → 2*(3 m) cosθ = 2.14093 m → 6 cosθ = 2.14093 → cosθ ≈ 0.35682 → θ ≈ 69 degrees. So the angle between them is 2θ ≈ 138 degrees. So the answer would be A. 138.

But wait, the problem states that one photon is upper-right and the other lower-right. If they are symmetric with respect to the x-axis, then the angle between them is 2θ. But if the angles are not symmetric, but the momenta magnitudes are the same, then the angle between them would be different. However, given that their energies are the same, their momenta magnitudes are the same. But since their directions are upper-right and lower-right, the angles must be symmetric with respect to the x-axis. Therefore, the angle between them is indeed 2θ ≈ 138 degrees.

But wait, another approach: using conservation of momentum and the fact that photons have opposite directions. Let's consider the total momentum before collision. Since the electron and positron are moving along the x-axis, their total momentum is p_initial = m (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) as calculated earlier. After collision, the two photons must have momenta p1 and p2 such that p1 + p2 = p_initial, and |p1| = |p2| = E/c = 3 m (since E_photon = 3 m c², and c=1). Therefore, p1 = (E cosθ, E sinθ), p2 = (E cosφ, E sinφ). The sum is (E cosθ + E cosφ, E sinθ + E sinφ) = (p_initial_x, 0). Therefore, E sinθ + E sinφ = 0 → sinθ = -sinφ → φ = -θ. Therefore, the angles are θ and -θ. Hence, the angle between them is θ - (-θ) = 2θ. So the angle is 2θ. Therefore, if θ ≈ 69 degrees, the angle between them is ≈138 degrees. So the answer is A. 138.

But wait, let's check the calculation again for the initial momentum. Wait, when I set c=1, then the velocities are in terms of c. But the actual calculation for p_initial is:

p_initial = m_e γ_e v_e - m_p γ_p v_p. Wait, no. Wait, the positron is moving in the opposite direction, so its velocity is negative. So p_initial = m_e γ_e v_e (to the right) + m_p γ_p (-v_p) (to the left). Since m_e = m_p = m, this becomes:

p_initial = m [ γ_e v_e - γ_p v_p ].

As calculated before, γ_e v_e = sqrt(15), γ_p v_p = sqrt(3). So p_initial = m (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

But if c=1, then the units are in terms of m and m/s. But since E_photon = p, and E_photon = 3 m c², but with c=1, E_photon = 3 m. Therefore, p_photon = 3 m. So the equations hold.

Therefore, the angle between the two photons is 2θ ≈ 138 degrees. So the answer should be A. 138.

But wait, let me double-check the calculation of cosθ. cosθ = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))/6 ≈ (3.87298 - 1.73205)/6 ≈ 2.14093/6 ≈ 0.35682. Then θ = arccos(0.35682). Let's compute this more accurately.

Using a calculator: arccos(0.35682) ≈ 69.0 degrees. So 2θ ≈ 138.0 degrees. Therefore, the angle is approximately 138 degrees, which is option A.

But wait, the problem states that the directions are upper-right and lower-right. The angle between the two directions would be the sum of the angles from the x-axis to each direction. If one is at +θ and the other at -θ, the angle between them is 2θ. So yes, 138 degrees. Therefore, the answer should be A. 138.

But let me check if there's another approach. For example, using the invariant quantity like the Mandelstam variable s, but I think that's more complicated. Alternatively, considering that the total energy is the sum of the relativistic energies, and the total momentum is the vector sum.

Alternatively, considering that the photons are moving at 45 degrees? No, because their directions are given as upper-right and lower-right, but the angle between them is determined by their individual angles from the x-axis. Since their angles are symmetric, the angle between them is twice one of the angles.

Therefore, after careful calculation, the angle between the photons is approximately 138 degrees, so the answer is A. 138.
