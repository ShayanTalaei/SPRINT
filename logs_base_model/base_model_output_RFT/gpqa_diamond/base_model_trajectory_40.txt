Okay, so I need to figure out the speed of light in glass relative to the observer when the glass is moving at a constant velocity v towards the observer. Let's start by recalling some basic concepts.

First, I know that when light travels through a medium like glass, its speed decreases. The formula for the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum (which is given here as 1), and n is the index of refraction of the medium. So normally, without any motion, the speed of light in glass would be 1/n.

But in this problem, the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. So we have to consider the effect of the glass's motion on the observed speed of the light. This is a situation involving relative velocities, so maybe I need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity? Wait, but wait—glass is a medium, and maybe the movement of the medium affects the light's speed in a different way.

Wait, no, special relativity's velocity addition applies when you have two objects moving relative to each other. The formula is u' = (u + v)/(1 + uv/c²), where u is the velocity of an object in one frame, and v is the relative velocity between the frames. But here, the light is moving through the glass, which is moving. So perhaps we need to apply this formula here.

But wait, the speed of light in the glass is already 1/n in the glass's rest frame, right? So if the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer, then in the lab frame (observer's frame), the speed of light would be adjusted by the velocity addition formula.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. In the glass's rest frame, the speed of light is c/n = 1/n. But the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. So to find the speed of light in the lab frame (which is the observer's frame), we need to transform the velocity from the glass's frame to the lab's frame.

Using the velocity addition formula from special relativity. The formula is u' = (u + v)/(1 + u*v/c²). Here, u is the velocity of light in the glass's frame, which is 1/n. The velocity v is the velocity of the glass relative to the lab frame. Wait, but in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. So when transforming from the glass's frame (S') to the lab frame (S), the velocity of the light would be u = (u' + v)/(1 + u'v/c²), where u' is the speed in the glass's frame.

Wait, maybe I got the direction wrong. Let's clarify. Let's say the lab frame is S, and the glass is moving at velocity v in the +x direction (towards the observer). The light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So in the glass's frame (which is moving at velocity v in the lab's frame), the light's speed is 1/n. But since the glass is moving towards the observer, in the lab frame, the light's speed would be higher than in the glass's frame. So we need to apply the velocity addition formula correctly.

The velocity addition formula is u = (u' + v)/(1 + (u'v)/c²). Here, u' is the velocity of the light in the glass's frame, which is 1/n. The velocity v is the velocity of the glass relative to the lab frame. Since the glass is moving towards the observer, v is positive. The light is moving in the same direction, so its velocity in the lab frame would be u = (1/n + v)/(1 + (1/n * v)/c²). But since c=1, this simplifies to (1/n + v)/(1 + (v/n)).

Wait, but let's check the direction again. If the glass is moving towards the observer, then in the lab frame, the light's speed should be the sum of the glass's speed and the light's speed in the glass's frame. But that's only non-relativistic. Since we're dealing with light, we need to use the relativistic formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the frame transformations. In the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at 1/n. The glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. So to find the light's speed in the lab frame, we can use the velocity addition formula. Let's denote the lab frame as S, and the glass's frame as S', which is moving at velocity v relative to S.

In S', the light's velocity is u' = 1/n. The velocity of S' relative to S is v. So the light's velocity in S (the lab frame) would be u = (u' + v)/(1 + u'v/c²). Since c=1, this becomes (1/n + v)/(1 + (1/n) v).

But wait, that's the formula for adding velocities. Let me confirm. If an object is moving at u' in S', and S' is moving at velocity v relative to S, then the velocity in S is u = (u' + v)/(1 + u'v). Yes, that's the standard formula. So substituting u' = 1/n, we get u = (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n) = ( (1 + n v)/n ) / ( (n + v)/n ) ) = (1 + n v)/(n + v). Wait, that simplifies to (1 + n v)/(n + v). So that would be option C.

Wait, but let me check again. Let me make sure I didn't mix up the frames. The glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. So in the lab frame, the glass is moving at v. The light inside the glass is moving at 1/n in the glass's frame. Since the glass is moving towards the observer, the light's velocity in the lab frame would be greater than 1/n. The formula gives (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n) = (1 + n v)/(n + v), which is option C.

But wait, let me think again. If the glass is moving towards the observer, then in the lab frame, the light in the glass should be moving faster. So if v is positive, then (1 + n v)/(n + v) would be greater than 1/n. Let's test with some numbers. Suppose n=1 (so no slowing down), then the speed would be (1 + v)/(1 + v) = 1. That makes sense: if the glass isn't slowing down the light (n=1), then moving the glass at v towards the observer, the light's speed relative to the observer is still 1. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, if the glass isn't slowing down the light (n=1), then the speed in the glass is 1, and if the glass is moving towards the observer at velocity v, then according to the formula, the speed in the lab frame would be (1 + v)/(1 + v) = 1. Which is correct, because if n=1, the glass is transparent (like air), and the speed of light is 1. Then, moving the medium at velocity v, the speed of light relative to the lab would be 1 + v (if non-relativistic), but according to the formula, it's 1. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no—if the glass isn't slowing down the light (n=1), then the speed in the lab frame should be 1 + v. But according to the formula, it's (1 + v)/(1 + v) = 1. That contradicts. So maybe there's a mistake in the formula.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the direction of the velocity. Let me double-check the velocity addition formula. The formula is u = (u' + v)/(1 + u'v/c²). Here, u' is the velocity of the object in the moving frame (glass's frame), and v is the velocity of the moving frame (glass) relative to the lab frame. If the glass is moving towards the observer at velocity v (so v is positive), then the light in the glass is moving at u' = 1/n in the glass's frame. So when transformed to the lab frame, u = (u' + v)/(1 + u'v/c²). Since c=1, this is (1/n + v)/(1 + (1/n)v). Let's compute this for n=1. Then u = (1 + v)/(1 + v) = 1. But in reality, if the glass isn't slowing down the light (n=1), then the speed of light in the lab frame should be 1 + v, right? Because the glass is moving at v towards the observer, so the light's speed relative to the observer should be the sum of the glass's speed and the speed of light in the glass.

Wait, but according to the formula, when n=1, the speed in the lab frame is 1, which contradicts the expectation. So there must be a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe the formula is different because the medium is moving. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the medium's motion and how it affects the speed of light. When a medium is moving, the speed of light in the lab frame is given by the relativistic addition of the medium's speed and the light's speed in the medium. But wait, if the medium is moving at velocity v, then the speed of light in the lab frame would be u = (c_medium + v)/(1 + (c_medium * v)/c²). Since c_medium = c/n = 1/n, this becomes (1/n + v)/(1 + (v/n)/1) = (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n) = (1 + n v)/(n + v). Which is the same as before, option C.

But when n=1, this gives (1 + v)/(1 + v) = 1, which suggests that the speed of light in the lab frame is 1, but according to classical mechanics, it should be 1 + v. But according to special relativity, the speed of light must always be 1 in any inertial frame. Wait, no—that's not correct. Wait, the speed of light in a medium is different, but in the frame of the medium, it's 1/n. If the medium is moving at velocity v, then in the lab frame, the speed of light would be (1/n + v)/(1 + (1/n)v), which can be greater than 1 if v is positive. However, according to special relativity, the speed of light in any inertial frame must be c=1. But this is not possible here because the medium is moving. Wait, no—the medium's motion affects the speed of light in the lab frame, but according to the velocity addition formula, the speed of light in the lab frame would still be 1. Wait, that can't be right. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the frames. Let's take an example. Suppose the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. In the glass's frame, the light is moving at 1/n. Then, using the velocity addition formula, the lab frame (observer's frame) would see the light moving at (1/n + v)/(1 + (1/n)v). If n=1, this becomes (1 + v)/(1 + v) = 1. But that suggests that even though the glass is moving at velocity v, the speed of light in the lab frame is still 1. But according to the theory of relativity, the speed of light must be 1 in all inertial frames. So if the glass is moving, the speed of light in the lab frame should still be 1, regardless of the glass's speed. But that's only possible if the glass is the medium. Wait, but the glass is moving, so the medium is moving. So the speed of light in the lab frame would be 1/n + v, but adjusted by the relativistic formula.

Wait, but this seems to conflict with the fact that the speed of light must be invariant. Wait, no—the speed of light in a medium is frame-dependent. The medium's motion affects the speed of light in the lab frame. So in the lab frame, the speed of light would be different from the speed of light in the medium's rest frame. But according to the velocity addition formula, it's (1/n + v)/(1 + (v/n)). If n=1, this gives 1, which is correct because the medium's speed doesn't affect the speed of light in its own rest frame. Wait, no—if the medium is moving, then the speed of light in the lab frame would be different. Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the medium's refractive index.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that when the medium is moving, the speed of light in the lab frame is given by the relativistic formula, which would be (c_medium + v)/(1 + (c_medium * v)/c²). Since c_medium = c/n = 1/n, this becomes (1/n + v)/(1 + (v/n)) = (1 + n v)/(n + v). So that's option C.

But when n=1, this gives (1 + v)/(1 + v) = 1, which matches the expectation that the speed of light in a medium with n=1 (which is a vacuum) moving at velocity v would still have the speed of 1 in the lab frame. Wait, but if the medium is moving, shouldn't the speed of light in the lab frame be different? Wait, no—if the medium's refractive index is n=1, it's effectively a vacuum. So moving the medium (which is like moving the vacuum) shouldn't affect the speed of light. So in that case, the speed of light in the lab frame is still 1, which matches the formula. So that seems correct.

Another test case: suppose n approaches infinity. Then the medium becomes a perfectly reflecting surface. If n is very large, then the speed of light in the medium is very small (1/n ≈ 0). If the medium is moving at velocity v, then according to the formula, the speed of light in the lab frame would be (0 + v)/(1 + 0) = v. So the speed of light in the lab frame would be v. Which makes sense, because if the medium is moving at v and almost stops the light, then the light's speed in the lab frame would be approximately v.

Another test case: suppose v is very small. Then the formula (1 + n v)/(n + v) ≈ (1 + n v)/(n (1 + v/n)) ≈ (1 + n v)/(n) * (1 - v/n) ≈ (1/n)(1 + n v)(1 - v/n) ≈ (1/n)(1 + n v - v/n - v²/n²). Ignoring higher-order terms, this is approximately (1/n)(1 + v(n - 1)/n). For small v, this is about 1/n + v. Which matches the non-relativistic addition of velocities, since in non-relativistic terms, the speed would be 1/n + v. So that checks out.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option C: (1 + n v)/(n + v).
