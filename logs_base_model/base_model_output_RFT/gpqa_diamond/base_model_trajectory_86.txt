Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, the question is about identifying the correct 1H NMR data for a specific aromatic compound. Let's break down the information given step by step.

First, the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. So, that tells me there's both a carbonyl (like a ketone or aldehyde) and an aromatic ring with a halogen substituent.

Wait, the aromatic ring is di-substituted. So, two substituents on the benzene ring. The total carbons are 8. Let's think: a benzene ring has 6 carbons. If there are two substituent groups, each substituent adds some carbons. Since the total is 8, that means the substituents add 2 more carbons. So, each substituent would be a single carbon atom? Wait, but substituents can have more than one carbon. For example, if one substituent is a CH2 group and another is a CH3, that would add 4 carbons. Hmm, maybe I need to reconsider.

Wait, the molecule is di-substituted, so two groups attached to the benzene ring. The total number of carbons is 8. Benzene has 6, so substituents add 2 carbons. So each substituent must be a single carbon atom. That would mean substituents like -CH2X (where X is a halogen), but wait, if each is a CH2, then two CH2 groups would add 4 carbons. That's not matching. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is a ketone (like -COR) which would have a carbonyl group. Wait, but the FTIR indicates a carbonyl group. So perhaps one substituent is a ketone (like -CO-) and another is a halogen (like -X), but how does that work?

Wait, maybe the substituents are a carbonyl group (like a ketone) and a halogen. But a ketone is a carbonyl group, so the substituent would be -COR. So, the benzene ring has two substituents: one is a carbonyl group (like -CO-) and another is a halogen (like -X). But how does that fit into the total carbons?

Wait, the benzene ring is 6 carbons. If one substituent is a carbonyl group, which would be a single carbon (like -CO-), but that's a carbonyl attached to the ring. So, for example, if it's a benzaldehyde group (PhCHO), that would add one carbon (from the aldehyde group). Then the other substituent would be a halogen, like -Cl, -Br, -F. So total carbons would be 6 (benzene) + 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (halogen) = 8. That matches the total. So the structure would be a benzene ring with a -CHO and a -X substituent (X being a halogen).

Alternatively, maybe the carbonyl is part of a ketone substituent. For example, a benzophenone derivative with a halogen. But let's think about the substituents. If the substituents are -CHO and -X, then the structure would be something like benzaldehyde with a halogen substituent.

But wait, the FTIR also shows an aromatic-halogen bond. That suggests that the halogen is attached to the benzene ring. So, the structure is a benzene ring with both a ketone (carbonyl) group and a halogen substituent.

Alternatively, maybe the carbonyl is part of a substituent that's not directly attached to the ring. Wait, but the question says "di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound," so the substituents are on the benzene ring. So, each substituent is attached directly to the ring.

So, the substituents are a carbonyl group (like -CO-) and a halogen (like -X). But how exactly are they attached? Let me think. For example, one substituent could be a phenyl group with a ketone (like OCO-), but that might not fit. Wait, maybe the carbonyl is part of a ketone substituent. Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzophenone derivative with a halogen attached. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the carbonyl is part of an acyl group substituent. For example, one substituent is -CO-R, but that would add more carbons unless R is a hydrogen. Wait, if R is a hydrogen, then it's just -COR, so one carbon from the carbonyl. Then the other substituent is -X. So total carbons: 6 (benzene) + 1 (CO) + 1 (X) = 8. That works.

So the structure would be a benzene ring with two substituents: one is a ketone group (like -CO-) and another is a halogen atom (-X). But wait, a substituent like -X would be a single atom, but in reality, substituents are groups. So maybe the halogen is attached as a -X group, like -Cl, -Br, -F. But then the molecule would have a -CO- group and a -X group on the ring.

Wait, but the question says "a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound containing 8 carbon atoms in total." So, substituents are groups attached to the ring. Let's count the carbons again. Benzene (6 C) + substituent 1 (CO-) which is one C (from the carbonyl) + substituent 2 (X) which is one C? Wait, no. The substituent -CO- is a carbonyl group attached to the ring. The carbonyl group is part of a ketone substituent, like -COR. So, if R is a hydrogen, then substituent is -COH (aldehyde) but that's not possible. Wait, maybe substituent is -CO-R, where R is a hydrogen, so -CHO (aldehyde group). But then the aldehyde group is -CHO, which has one carbon (the carbonyl carbon). Then substituent 2 is -X, which is a single atom but as a substituent, it's -X (like -Cl, -Br, -F). Wait, but substituents can't be just single atoms. They have to be groups. So perhaps the substituent is -Cl, which is a single substituent (a chlorine atom attached to the ring). So the substituents are -CHO (aldehyde) and -X (like Cl, Br, F). But then the total carbons would be 6 (benzene) + 1 (CHO) + 0 (since X is a single atom, not adding any carbons). Wait, that would be 7 carbons. But the question says 8 carbons. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a ketone group that is part of an acyl group. Like -CO-O-R or something else. Wait, maybe the substituent is a carbonyl group attached to another carbon. For example, maybe it's a benzene ring with a substituent like -COR where R is an alkyl group. For example, -CO-CH2-Cl. Then the substituent would add two carbons (the CO and the CH2). Let me check: benzene (6) + substituent 1 (CO-CH2-Cl) which adds 3 carbons (CO is one, CH2 is two), but wait, CO-CH2-Cl would be a substituent with the carbonyl group attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to Cl. But that would add 2 carbons (from CH2 and Cl). Wait, Cl is an atom, not a carbon. So substituent 1: CO-CH2- (so two carbons) and substituent 2: Cl. Then total carbons: 6 + 2 + 0 = 8. That matches. But then the substituents would be -COCH2- and -Cl. So the structure would be benzene with a COCH2Cl substituent and a Cl substituent? Wait, but that would be a tri-substituted benzene, but the question says di-substituted. So that's not possible.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think again. The total carbons are 8. Benzene is 6. So substituents add 2 carbons. Each substituent must add 1 carbon. But substituents can't be single carbons unless they are like -CH2X. Wait, if one substituent is -CH2Cl, that's two carbons (CH2 and Cl, but Cl is an atom). Wait, no. Wait, substituent -CH2Cl would be a CH2 group attached to Cl. So the substituent is -CH2Cl, which is a single substituent. Then substituent 1: -CH2Cl (2 carbons: CH2 and Cl? Wait, no. CH2Cl is a group with one carbon (CH2) and Cl attached. Wait, no. CH2Cl is a group where the carbon is connected to two H's and one Cl. So the substituent is -CH2Cl, which is a single substituent (so that's one substituent, but it's a -CH2Cl group, which has one carbon. Wait, but the substituent is a group attached to the ring. The substituent -CH2Cl has one carbon (the CH2), but the Cl is attached to the CH2. So total carbons from substituents: 1 (from CH2). Then the other substituent would have to add 1 carbon. But how? Because substituents can't be like -CH2Cl and another substituent with one carbon. Wait, maybe the other substituent is a carbonyl group attached to another carbon. Like -CO-R, where R is a group with one carbon. For example, -COCH3 (acetophenone). But then substituent 1: -COCH3 (two carbons) and substituent 2: -Cl. Then total carbons would be 6 (benzene) + 2 (COCH3) + 0 (Cl) = 8. That works. So substituents are -COCH3 and -Cl. But wait, that would make the substituents di-substituted. So the structure would be benzene ring with a ketone substituent (acetophenone-like) and a chlorine substituent.

But then, the FTIR shows a carbonyl group (which would be the -CO- in the ketone substituent) and an aromatic-halogen bond (Cl attached to the ring). That fits. So the NMR would show signals corresponding to these groups.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: 1H NMR: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s). This looks like a para-substituted benzene with two doublets (each 2H) and a singlet (3H). Maybe a toluene-like group. But wait, the substituent is -COCH3 and -Cl. The COCH3 would give a triplet around 2.3 ppm (for the CH3 attached to the carbonyl). But in option A, the singlet is at 1.3 ppm (3H), which is more like a methyl group attached to something, but not a carbonyl. Maybe this is not the right structure.

Option B: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s). The singlet at 6.9 ppm is a single proton, which is unusual for a benzene ring. Benzene rings usually have multiple protons unless there's a substituent causing a single proton. But in a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, the protons adjacent to each substituent would be equivalent. Wait, but if the substituents are in a meta position, maybe? Or if there's a strong de-shielding effect causing a singlet. Alternatively, maybe this is a meta substitution, but I'm not sure. The 4.8 and 4.6 ppm doublets could be the COCH3 (around 2.3 ppm) but that's lower. Wait, no. Wait, the COCH3 would be around 2.3 ppm as a triplet, but in option B, the peaks are at 4.8 and 4.6. These could be the protons adjacent to the ketone. Wait, maybe it's a vinyl group. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in such a way that there's a para-substituted benzene with a -COCH2Cl group? Wait, but earlier we thought substituents are -COCH3 and -Cl. But in that case, the COCH3 would have a triplet at around 2.3 ppm. But none of the options have that. Let's check option D: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). The 2.3 singlet would be the CH3 attached to CO. Then the aromatic protons at 7.8 and 7.6 (each 2H, doublets) could be para-substituted. But then the other substituent would be -Cl. So the structure would be benzene with -COCH3 and -Cl. Wait, but how would that look in NMR?

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a benzaldehyde with a halogen substituent. For example, benzaldehyde (PhCHO) with a Cl substituent. But then the substituents would be -CHO and -Cl. The CHO group would have a peak around 9-10 ppm, but none of the options have that. Option C has a peak at 9.9 ppm, which is a singlet (1H). That could be the aldehyde proton, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. However, in the question, the FTIR shows a carbonyl group, which could be from either a ketone or an aldehyde. But if the substituent is an aldehyde, the NMR would have a strong peak around 9-10 ppm. Option C has 9.9 ppm (1H, s). Then the aromatic protons would be split into two doublets. Let's see: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d). That suggests a para-substituted benzene with two substituents: one at the para position to the aldehyde. Wait, but the aldehyde is a substituent. Wait, if the benzene has an aldehyde group (CHO) and a halogen (Cl), then the substituents would be para to each other. Then the aromatic protons would be two sets of doublets. But the aldehyde group is a strong deshielding group, so the adjacent protons would be shifted downfield. The aldehyde proton would be a singlet at around 9.9 ppm. Then the aromatic protons adjacent to CHO would be at higher ppm, maybe around 7.8 and 7.6. The other aromatic protons would be at a lower ppm. But in option C, the aromatic peaks are 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d), which would correspond to a para-substituted benzene with two substituents (CHO and Cl) in the para positions. Wait, but if the substituents are meta to each other, the protons would be different. But in option C, the aromatic protons are two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests that there are two sets of equivalent protons, which would be the case for a para-disubstituted benzene. So if the substituents are para to each other, then the aromatic protons would be two sets of two equivalent protons each.

But let's check the substituents. If the substituents are CHO (aldehyde) and Cl (halogen), the structure would be para-Cl-benzaldehyde. The aldehyde group would be at position 1, Cl at position 3? Wait, no. In para substitution, substituents are opposite each other. So positions 1 and 3 are meta, positions 1 and 4 are para. Wait, benzene is numbered such that substituents are on adjacent carbons. Wait, perhaps the substituents are at positions 1 and 4 (para). Then the aldehyde would be at position 1, Cl at position 4. Then the aromatic protons would be at positions 2 and 6 (each adjacent to CHO) and positions 3 and 5 (each adjacent to Cl). But the protons adjacent to CHO would be deshielded and appear around 7.8 ppm, and those adjacent to Cl would be around 7.6 ppm. That matches option C. The aldehyde proton is at 9.9 ppm, a singlet. Then the aromatic protons are two doublets. The other substituent (Cl) would cause an aromatic-halogen bond, which matches the FTIR data. The Cl substituent would also cause splitting of the aromatic protons, but in this case, the protons are in a para-disubstituted benzene, leading to two sets of doublets. The CH3 group in option C is at 2.3 ppm, but there's no CH3 in the structure. Wait, the substituent is CHO and Cl. So there's no CH3 group. Wait, option C has a singlet at 2.3 ppm (3H). That would imply a CH3 group, but in our structure, there's a CHO and Cl substituent. Wait, maybe the substituent is a CH2Cl group. Let me reconsider. If the substituent is -CH2Cl, then the NMR would show a triplet for the CH2 (around 3.5 ppm) and a singlet for the Cl. But none of the options show that. Alternatively, if the substituent is -COCH3 and -Cl, then the NMR would have a triplet for the CH3 at around 2.3 ppm. But none of the options have that. Let's look again.

Option D: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). So this has two aromatic doublets and a singlet at 2.3 ppm (3H). The singlet suggests a CH3 group attached to something. If the substituent is -COCH3 and another substituent is, say, -X (halogen), then the CH3 would be at 2.3 ppm. But the aromatic protons would be split into two doublets. If the substituents are para to each other, then aromatic protons would be two doublets. For example, substituent 1: -COCH3 at position 1, substituent 2: -Cl at position 4. Then the aromatic protons would be at positions 2 and 6 (adjacent to COCH3) and positions 3 and 5 (adjacent to Cl). The protons at positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent and appear as a doublet around 7.8 ppm, and protons at positions 3 and 5 would be a doublet around 7.6 ppm. That matches option D. But the substituent -COCH3 would have a CH3 group at 2.3 ppm, which is the singlet in option D. So that fits. Then the aromatic protons are split into two doublets. Also, the FTIR would show a carbonyl group (from the ketone) and an aromatic-halogen bond (from the Cl substituent). That matches the question.

But wait, the problem states that the FTIR shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. So the substituents are a ketone and a halogen. So the structure would be a benzene ring with -COCH3 and -Cl substituents. The NMR would show the aromatic protons as two doublets (7.8 and 7.6 ppm), the COCH3 as a singlet at 2.3 ppm, and the Cl substituent would not show up in the 1H NMR as a separate peak (since Cl is not a proton). Wait, but in option D, there's no Cl peak. That's okay because Cl is not a proton and doesn't appear in the 1H NMR. So the aromatic protons are split into two doublets, and the CH3 is a triplet. Wait, no, in option D, the CH3 is a singlet at 2.3 ppm. Wait, but CH3 attached to a carbonyl would be a triplet. For example, the -COCH3 group would have the CH3 next to the carbonyl. The splitting would be a triplet due to coupling with the carbonyl carbon. Wait, but the carbonyl is a double bond, so maybe the coupling is different. Wait, the carbonyl is a C=O group. The adjacent CH3 would be split by the adjacent carbon. Wait, but in the structure, the carbonyl is part of the substituent. So the substituent is -COCH3. The structure would be benzene ring with a -COCH3 group and a -Cl group. The CH3 is attached to the carbonyl carbon. The splitting would come from the adjacent carbon (the one attached to the ring). Wait, but the carbonyl is a double bond, so the adjacent carbon is the one attached to the ring. So the CH3 would be split by the adjacent carbon (the one attached to the ring). Let's think: the substituent is -CH2-CO-R? Wait, no. Wait, the substituent is -CO-CH2-X? Wait, no. If the substituent is -COCH3, then the structure is benzene-C(=O)-CH3. Then the CH3 is attached to the carbonyl carbon. The splitting would come from the adjacent carbon (the one attached to the ring). Wait, but the ring is attached to the carbonyl carbon, which is double-bonded to oxygen. So the CH3 is attached to a carbon that's double-bonded to oxygen. In such a case, the CH3 would experience splitting from the adjacent carbon. But since the ring is attached to the carbonyl carbon, and the CH3 is attached to the same carbon, maybe there's no splitting. Wait, no. The carbonyl is C=O. The adjacent carbon (the one attached to the ring) is connected to the carbonyl carbon. So the CH3 would be attached to the carbonyl carbon, which is connected to the ring. The ring's protons would be attached to the same carbon as the carbonyl. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to draw it mentally. Structure: benzene ring with a substituent group -COCH3. The substituent is directly attached to the ring. So the ring's carbon is connected to the carbonyl carbon, which is connected to the CH3. So the ring's carbon is -C(=O)-CH3. The CH3 is attached to the carbonyl carbon. The splitting of the CH3 would come from coupling with the adjacent carbon (the one attached to the ring). But the ring's carbon is part of the benzene ring, which is symmetric. Wait, but the ring's carbon is attached to three other ring carbons. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the CH3 would be a singlet because there's no adjacent protons to cause splitting. Alternatively, maybe the CH3 would be split by the adjacent ring protons. Wait, but the ring protons are on the adjacent carbons. Wait, in the case of acetophenone (benzene with -COCH3), the CH3 group is attached to the carbonyl carbon. The splitting of the CH3 would come from coupling with the adjacent ring protons. However, in acetophenone, the CH3 is a singlet because the adjacent protons are equivalent and there's no splitting. Wait, no. In acetophenone, the CH3 group is adjacent to the carbonyl group, and the ring protons are meta and para to the substituent. The CH3 would be split by the ring protons. But in reality, the acetophenone NMR shows the CH3 as a singlet because there's no coupling between the CH3 and the ring protons. Wait, but in reality, the ring protons are at a different chemical shift and the CH3 is a singlet. So in option D, the CH3 is a singlet at 2.3 ppm. That matches the expected acetophenone NMR. Then the aromatic protons would be split into two doublets. So if the substituents are -COCH3 and -Cl in para positions, the aromatic protons would be two doublets. The -COCH3 substituent would cause the adjacent protons to be deshielded and appear at higher ppm. So the protons adjacent to -COCH3 would be at lower ppm? Wait, no. Wait, in para-substituted benzene with two substituents, the protons adjacent to each substituent would be split. Let me think of the structure: benzene ring with substituent A at position 1 (COCH3) and substituent B at position 4 (Cl). Then the aromatic protons would be at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6. Position 2 and 6 are adjacent to substituent A (COCH3), and positions 3 and 5 are adjacent to substituent B (Cl). The substituent A is electron-withdrawing (due to the carbonyl group), which would deshield the adjacent protons, causing them to appear downfield (higher ppm). The substituent B is an electron-withdrawing group (halogen), which also deshields adjacent protons. However, the substituents are in para positions, so the protons adjacent to substituent A would be at higher ppm than those adjacent to substituent B. Alternatively, the substituent with stronger electron-withdrawing effect (Cl is more electronegative than carbonyl? Wait, Cl is more electronegative than oxygen, but the carbonyl is a strong electron-withdrawing group. Wait, but the substituent A is -COCH3, which is an electron-withdrawing group (due to the carbonyl). Substituent B is -Cl, which is also electron-withdrawing but less so than the carbonyl. So the protons adjacent to substituent A would be more deshielded and appear at higher ppm. So the protons at positions 2 and 6 (adjacent to COCH3) would be at higher ppm (like 7.8 ppm), and the protons at positions 3 and 5 (adjacent to Cl) would be at lower ppm (like 7.6 ppm). That matches option D: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d). The CH3 is a singlet at 2.3 ppm. So option D fits this scenario.

Now let's check the other options. Option A: 4.8 and 4.6 doublets. These could be the protons adjacent to the carbonyl and the halogen. But if substituent is -CHO and -Cl, then the protons adjacent to CHO would be at higher ppm (around 7 ppm), and those adjacent to Cl would be around 6.5 ppm. But the peaks in option A are lower (4.8 and 4.6). So that suggests substituents are not in ortho or para positions. Wait, maybe meta? Or perhaps the substituents are in a meta arrangement. But the aromatic ring with two substituents would have protons in certain positions. Option B has a singlet at 6.9 ppm. That could be a single proton, perhaps due to a substituent causing a unique environment for a proton. For example, if one substituent is -CHO and the other is -Cl, but arranged in such a way that one proton is unique. However, for a para-disubstituted benzene, there are two sets of equivalent protons. So the NMR would have two doublets, not a singlet. Option B has a singlet at 6.9 ppm, which would suggest a unique proton, but in a para-disubstituted benzene, there are four equivalent protons in two doublets. So option B is unlikely. Option C has a singlet at 9.9 ppm, which could be the aldehyde proton, but then the aromatic protons would need to be in a certain arrangement. However, the substituent would need to be -CHO and -Cl in such a way that the aromatic protons are two doublets. But option C's aromatic peaks are at 7.8 and 7.6, which are lower than expected for a benzaldehyde derivative. So option C might not fit.

So, considering all this, the correct NMR data should correspond to a para-substituted benzene with a -COCH3 and -Cl substituent. The aromatic protons would be two doublets, the CH3 would be a singlet at around 2.3 ppm, and the aromatic protons would be at around 7.8 and 7.6 ppm. That matches option D. Therefore, the correct answer should be D.
