Okay, so I need to figure out the correct answer to this quantum mechanics question. Let's start by reading the problem carefully again. The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given as V(r) = 1/2 m ω² r². The question asks for the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (states) that have the same energy eigenvalue. The options are A, B, C, D.

First, I remember that the three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator can be solved by separating the variables into radial and angular parts. The energy levels for such a system are quantized and depend on the quantum numbers associated with the radial and angular momentum. But wait, maybe it's easier to recall the formula for the energy levels in a 3D harmonic oscillator.

In three dimensions, the energy levels are given by the formula E = (n_r + l + 3/2) ħω, where n_r is the radial quantum number and l is the azimuthal quantum number. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the 3D and 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. Let me think again. For a three-dimensional harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. But since it's isotropic, the energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Alternatively, another way to write it is E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the total number of quanta, which is n = n_x + n_y + n_z. Wait, but that might not account for the angular momentum part. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify this.

Wait, in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the principal quantum number, which is the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction (n_x + n_y + n_z). But that's only considering the radial part. But actually, the energy in 3D harmonic oscillator is E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the total number of quanta, which is the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Wait, but that's similar to the 1D case but extended. Wait, no, in 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy is E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. So the total energy depends on the sum of the individual quantum numbers plus 3/2. But then, for each energy level, there are multiple states (eigenfunctions) with the same energy, depending on the different ways the quantum numbers can add up to the same total.

But wait, the question is about the third excited state. The ground state is the lowest energy state, which is n = 0 (n_x = n_y = n_z = 0), so the ground state energy is (0 + 3/2) ħω = 3/2 ħω. Then the first excited state would be n=1, which can be achieved by (1,0,0), (0,1,0), or (0,0,1). So there are 3 states for the first excited state. Then the second excited state would be n=2, which can be either (2,0,0) and permutations, or (1,1,0) and permutations. Wait, how many states are there for n=2? The number of states is the number of ways to sum the quantum numbers to 2. For three dimensions, the degeneracy (number of states) for a given n is (n + 2)(n + 1)/2. Wait, no, let's think again. For n=0: 1 state. For n=1: 3 states. For n=2: 6 states. Wait, how? Let me count. For n=2, the possible combinations are (2,0,0), (0,2,0), (0,0,2), and (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1). So that's 3 + 3 = 6 states. So for n=2, 6 states. Similarly, for n=3, the number would be 10 states. Wait, but the question is about the third excited state. Let's clarify the order. The ground state is n=0 (energy level 3/2 ħω), first excited state is n=1 (energy 5/2 ħω), second excited state is n=2 (energy 7/2 ħω), third excited state is n=3 (energy 9/2 ħω). Wait, that's the key point. The energy levels increase by ħω each time. So the ground state is the lowest, then each excited state is the next higher energy level.

So the third excited state would be n=3. The energy is (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. So the energy is 9/2 ħω. So looking at the options, B and D have 9/2 ħω. The other options have different energies. So that's the first part of the answer.

Now, the second part: how many linearly independent eigenfunctions are possible for the same energy eigenvalue. For a given energy level (n), the degeneracy is the number of states with that energy. As I thought earlier, for n=3, the number of states is (3 + 2)(3 + 1)/2? Wait, maybe a better way is to recall that the degeneracy for the n-th level in 3D harmonic oscillator is (n + 1)(n + 2)/2. Wait, let me check for n=0: (0+1)(0+2)/2 = 1*2/2=1. Correct. For n=1: (1+1)(1+2)/2=2*3/2=3. Correct. For n=2: (2+1)(2+2)/2=3*4/2=6. Correct. For n=3: (3+1)(3+2)/2=4*5/2=10. So for n=3, there are 10 eigenfunctions. But wait, looking at the options, choice B says 10 and D says 3. But wait, the options are:

A. 11 π² ħ²/(2m r²), 10

B. (9/2) ħ ω, 10

C. 11 π² ħ²/(2m r²), 3

D. (9/2) ħ ω, 3

So if the third excited state is n=3, energy is 9/2 ħω, and the degeneracy is 10. But option B says 10. However, the angular momentum part may affect the number of states. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator with the hydrogen atom. Wait, no, in a 3D harmonic oscillator, the degeneracy is higher than that in the hydrogen atom. Let me clarify.

In the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are E = (n + 3/2)ħω, where n = n_x + n_y + n_z. The degeneracy for each energy level is (n + 1)(n + 2)/2. So for n=3, it's (4)(5)/2=10. So the number of eigenfunctions is 10. Therefore, the answer should be 10. But looking at the options, both B and D have 10 and 3, respectively. Wait, but the energy in the options B and D is (9/2) ħω, which is correct for n=3. So the number of eigenfunctions would be 10, but in the options, B has 10. However, the answer provided in the options is either B or D. Wait, but the energy for the third excited state is (3 + 3/2) ħω = 9/2 ħω. So the correct energy is 9/2 ħω, and the degeneracy is 10. But the options B and D have 10 and 3, respectively. So why is there an option with 3? Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me re-examine the problem.

Wait, the problem says "the third excited state". The ground state is the first state (n=0), then first excited (n=1), second excited (n=2), third excited (n=3). So the energy is (3 + 3/2) ħω = 9/2 ħω. The degeneracy is 10. So the answer should be 9/2 ħω and 10. But looking at the options, B says 10 and D says 3. Wait, but the options don't have 10 for the number of eigenfunctions. Wait, option B is (9/2) ħω and 10. Option D is (9/2) ħω and 3. So according to my calculation, it's B. But why is D there with 3? Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the degeneracy.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is not considering the 3D harmonic oscillator but instead a different system. Wait, the problem states that the potential is V(r) = 1/2 m ω² r². That's the standard 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. So yes, the energy levels are E = (n + 3/2) ħω, and the degeneracy is (n + 1)(n + 2)/2. So for n=3, that's 10. So why is option D saying 3? Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Wait, perhaps the problem is considering only s-waves, which have l=0. Then the degeneracy would be different. Wait, but in the 3D harmonic oscillator, the degeneracy includes all possible l values. Let me think again.

In the 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the sum of n_x + n_y + n_z. The degeneracy for each n is (n + 1)(n + 2)/2. Therefore, for n=3, it's 10. So the number of eigenfunctions is 10. Therefore, the correct answer should be B: (9/2) ħω, 10. But the options don't have 10 for the number of eigenfunctions. Wait, looking back at the options:

A. 11 π² ħ² / (2m r²), 10

B. (9/2) ħ ω , 10

C. 11 π² ħ² / (2m r²), 3

D. (9/2) ħ ω, 3

So B has 10, D has 3. So if the answer is B, but why is 10 an option? Wait, but according to my calculation, the degeneracy is 10. So why is D with 3? Maybe the problem is considering angular momentum quantum numbers. Wait, but the 3D harmonic oscillator has more states than the hydrogen atom. Let me check again.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the radial part only, but that's not usual. The radial part in 3D harmonic oscillator is more complex. Wait, maybe the confusion arises between the 3D harmonic oscillator and the hydrogen atom. In the hydrogen atom, the energy levels depend on the principal quantum number n, and the degeneracy is (n + 1)^2. But in the 3D harmonic oscillator, the degeneracy is (n + 1)(n + 2)/2. So for the third excited state (n=3), the degeneracy is 10. Therefore, the correct answer should be B: (9/2) ħω, 10. But the options list B as 10, which matches. So why is D there? Maybe the problem is referring to the number of possible states with the same energy, but perhaps the question is considering the angular momentum. Wait, but the eigenfunctions are labeled by quantum numbers n, l, m. But in the 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy depends only on n, not on l. Therefore, all states with the same n have the same energy. The number of such states is the degeneracy, which is (n + 1)(n + 2)/2. Therefore, for n=3, 10 states. So the answer should be B. But let me check the options again.

Wait, but the problem states "how many linearly independent eigenfunctions are possible for the same energy eigenvalue?" So the answer is 10, which is option B. But the options given are:

B. (9/2) ħ ω , 10

D. (9/2) ħ ω, 3

Therefore, the correct answer should be B. However, the original problem's options may have a typo, or perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, let me check once more.

Wait, another approach: the energy levels of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. The degeneracy for each energy level is the number of ways to write n = n_x + n_y + n_z, where n is fixed. For n=3, the number of states is (3 + 2)(3 + 1)/2 = 10. So that's correct. Therefore, the answer should be 10. Therefore, the correct option is B. But looking at the answer choices, B is the only one with 10. So the answer should be B. However, the original problem's options include D with 3, which is likely incorrect.

Wait, but the question is in the context of the third excited state. The ground state is n=0 (energy 3/2 ħω), first excited state n=1 (5/2 ħω), second excited state n=2 (7/2 ħω), third excited state n=3 (9/2 ħω). So yes, n=3. Therefore, the energy is 9/2 ħω, and the degeneracy is 10. Therefore, the correct answer is B. But why is D there? Maybe the confusion is between the angular momentum quantum number l and the principal quantum number n. Wait, but in the 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy depends only on n, which is the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Therefore, the degeneracy includes all possible combinations of l and m. Therefore, the number of eigenfunctions is indeed 10.

Wait, but maybe the problem is referring to the radial part. Let me think. The radial wavefunction for a 3D harmonic oscillator can be written in terms of Laguerre polynomials, and the energy levels are determined by the principal quantum number n. The number of radial nodes increases with n. But the degeneracy includes all possible angular momentum quantum numbers l. Therefore, the total number of eigenfunctions is (n + 1)(n + 2)/2. Therefore, for n=3, 10. Therefore, the answer is B. But the options don't have B as an option. Wait, let me check the original question again.

Wait, the problem is stated as: "what is the value of energy of the third excited state, and how many linearly independent eigenfunctions are possible for the same energy eigenvalue?" The options are:

A. 11 π² ħ² / (2m r²), 10

B. (9/2) ħ ω , 10

C. 11 π² ħ² / (2m r²), 3

D. (9/2) ħ ω, 3

So the correct answer is B: (9/2) ħω and 10. Therefore, the correct choice is B. However, the original problem's options may have a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the 3D Coulomb potential, which is different. Wait, but the problem states V(r) = 1/2 m ω² r², which is the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. Therefore, the answer should be B. But the option D says 3, which would be the case if n=1 (first excited state), but the problem is asking for the third excited state, which is n=3. Therefore, the correct answer is B. But the options given by the user do include B as an option. Therefore, the answer is B. However, the user's original problem's options are A, B, C, D, with B and D having (9/2) ħω but different degeneracies. Therefore, the correct answer should be B. But wait, the problem statement says "how many linearly independent eigenfunctions are possible for the same energy eigenvalue?" So the answer is 10, which is option B. Therefore, the correct answer is B.
