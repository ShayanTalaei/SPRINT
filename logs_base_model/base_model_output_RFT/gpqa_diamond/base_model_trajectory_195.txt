Okay, so I need to figure out the maximum speed of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. Let me start by recalling what a harmonic oscillator is. In the non-relativistic case, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², and the maximum speed is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But since this is relativistic, I can't use the same approach because kinetic energy in relativity isn't just (1/2)mv². 

First, let's think about energy conservation. In the non-relativistic case, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA², where A is the amplitude. At maximum displacement, the kinetic energy is zero, and all energy is potential. At maximum speed, the kinetic energy is maximum, so the potential energy is zero. But in relativity, the kinetic energy is different.

Wait, the problem says the oscillator obeys Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. But in relativity, Hooke's law might not hold exactly the same way because forces could have different expressions. However, maybe the problem is assuming that the force is still F = -kx, so the potential energy is still (1/2)kx². Hmm, but relativistic effects come into play with the kinetic energy, not the potential energy. So maybe the potential energy is still the same, but the kinetic energy is relativistic.

In the non-relativistic case, maximum speed v_max occurs when all potential energy is converted to kinetic. So (1/2)mv_max² = (1/2)kA². Solving for v_max gives sqrt(kA²/m). That's option B. But since this is relativistic, we can't use this. So the answer must be different.

Relativistic kinetic energy is given by K = (γ - 1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor. The total energy of the system should still be conserved. The total energy at maximum displacement is the potential energy (1/2)kA², since kinetic energy is zero. At the equilibrium point (maximum speed), the potential energy is zero, and the total energy is the relativistic kinetic energy. So:

(γ - 1)mc² = (1/2)kA²

Solving for γ:

γ = 1 + (kA²)/(2mc²)

But the Lorentz factor γ is also 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (kA²)/(2mc²)

Let me solve for v. Let me denote (kA²)/(2mc²) as some term. Let's call that term 'a' for simplicity. So:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + a

Take reciprocal of both sides:

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + a)

Square both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + a)²

Then:

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + a)²

So v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + a)²) where a = (kA²)/(2mc²)

Let me compute 1 - 1/(1 + a)². Let's expand the denominator:

1/(1 + a)^2 = 1/(1 + 2a + a²)

But maybe there's a better way. Let's compute 1 - [1/(1 + a)^2] = [ (1 + a)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + a)^2

Expanding numerator: (1 + 2a + a² - 1) = 2a + a²

So numerator is 2a + a², denominator is (1 + a)^2. So:

sqrt( [2a + a²]/(1 + a)^2 ) = sqrt( [a(2 + a)] ) / (1 + a)

But maybe I can factor the numerator:

2a + a² = a(a + 2). The denominator is (a + 1)^2. So:

sqrt( [a(a + 2)] / (a + 1)^2 ) = sqrt(a(a + 2)) / (a + 1)

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Let me plug back a = (kA²)/(2mc²):

So sqrt( [ (kA²/(2mc²)) (kA²/(2mc²) + 2) ] ) / (1 + kA²/(2mc²) )

This seems complicated. Let me see if there's a simpler way. Alternatively, maybe there's a binomial approximation, but since the problem is multiple-choice, maybe we can manipulate the answer options to see which one matches this expression.

Looking at the options:

Option C: v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²)/(2mc²))² )

Wait, that's exactly what I have here. Let me check:

In my expression, v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + a)^2 ), where a = (kA²)/(2mc²). So yes, that's exactly option C. Let me check the other options.

Option A: c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²)/(2m))² ). Hmm, the denominator here is 1 - (kA²)/(2m), which doesn't have the c² term. Also, the numerator is 1, but in my case, it's a = (kA²)/(2mc²). So this seems incorrect.

Option B is the non-relativistic case, so not applicable here.

Option D: c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²)/(2mc²)) ). So here, inside the sqrt, it's 1 + 1/(1 - a), which would be (1 - a +1)/ (1 - a) = (2 - a)/(1 - a). But in my case, the expression inside the sqrt is 1 - 1/(1 + a)^2, which doesn't match this.

So the correct answer should be option C. Let me verify once again.

Total energy at maximum displacement is (1/2)kA². At maximum speed, potential energy is zero, so all energy is kinetic. Relativistic kinetic energy is (γ - 1)mc² = (1/2)kA².

So γ = 1 + (kA²)/(2mc²)

γ = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (kA²)/(2mc²)

Square both sides:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = [1 + (kA²)/(2mc²)]^2

So 1 - v²/c² = 1/[1 + (kA²)/(2mc²)]^2

Then v²/c² = 1 - 1/[1 + (kA²)/(2mc²)]^2

Which is exactly what option C states. So yes, option C is correct.
Therefore, the correct answer is $\boxed{C}$.
