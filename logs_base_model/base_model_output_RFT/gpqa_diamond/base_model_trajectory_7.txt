Okay, let's try to figure out this genetics problem. So, the question is about three candidate genes (G1, G2, G3) in white lupine that might be involved in resistance to anthracnose, a fungal disease. They've done some knockouts and double knockouts and tested their sensitivity. The results are given, and we need to determine which conclusion about their interactions is correct from the options A to D.

First, I need to recall what knockouts mean. A knockout mutant (g1, g2, g3) is a plant where the gene is inactivated, so they can't produce the gene product. If the gene product is necessary for disease resistance, then the mutant should be more susceptible (lower resistance percentage) than wild-type. Conversely, if the gene isn't involved, the resistance should remain the same.

The wild-type resistance is 100%, and the mutants have lower percentages. The control is 100%, so higher percentage = more resistant. Lower percentage = more susceptible. So, a resistance of 0% means the plant is completely susceptible and shows signs of infection.

Now, the results:

- g1: 75% resistance (so 25% less than wild-type)
- g2: 0% (completely susceptible)
- g3: 50% (half as resistant)
- g1g2: 0%
- g1g3: 10% (so 90% less than wild-type)
- g2g3: 0%

We need to figure out the roles of G1, G2, G3 and their interactions.

The question also mentions that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. Transcription factors typically regulate the expression of other genes. So if a gene is a transcription factor, its knockout might affect other genes, leading to different phenotypes.

Let's start by analyzing each single mutant:

1. g1: 75% resistance. So 25% loss. Since wild-type is 100%, this suggests that G1 contributes to 25% of the resistance. But why? Maybe G1 is redundant with another gene, or it's part of a pathway where it's not the main gene. Alternatively, it could be a transcription factor that's necessary for the expression of another gene (like G3). 

2. g2: 0% resistance. This is the most severe phenotype. If G2 is knocked out, the plant is completely susceptible. This suggests that G2 is crucial for some function. If G2 is a transcription factor, its knockout would prevent the activation of downstream genes. Alternatively, G2 might be directly involved in the defense mechanism.

3. g3: 50% resistance. So half of the wild-type. Maybe G3 is involved in a redundant pathway with another gene. If G3 is knocked out, the other gene (like G1) might compensate, but since the single mutant of G3 is 50%, perhaps it's part of a two-gene pathway. Or, if G3 is a transcription factor that's necessary for the expression of another gene, and that gene's product is needed for resistance, then knocking out G3 would reduce resistance.

Now, the double mutants:

- g1g2: 0% resistance. So both G1 and G2 are knocked out. The resistance is 0% even though g2 alone was 0%. This suggests that G2's function is not dependent on G1. If G2 is a transcription factor, its knockout would prevent the activation of downstream genes regardless of G1's status. So in g1g2, even though G1 is knocked out, G2's knockout might still allow some function through another pathway? Or perhaps G2's function is independent of G1.

- g1g3: 10% resistance. So both G1 and G3 are knocked out. Resistance is 10%, which is lower than wild-type. Since g2 alone is 0%, which is more severe than g1 or g3, perhaps G2's function is more critical. So in g1g3, maybe G1 and G3 are not both necessary for full resistance. Or maybe their combined knockout has a different effect. For example, if G2 is a transcription factor that's necessary for the expression of both G1 and G3, then knocking out G2 would prevent both G1 and G3 from being expressed. But in this case, the double mutants g1g2 and g1g3 still have some resistance, which suggests that G2's knockout is the main factor. Wait, in g1g2, the resistance is 0%, which is the same as g2 alone. So G1's knockout doesn't affect the phenotype when G2 is already knocked out. That suggests that G2's function is not dependent on G1. So G1 might be part of a redundant pathway with another gene, but G2 is acting upstream of both G1 and G3.

Wait, let's think again. If G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1 and G3, then in the wild-type, G2's expression leads to the expression of G1 and G3. If G2 is knocked out (g2), then G1 and G3 can't be expressed, leading to 0% resistance. But in the single mutant g1, G1 can't be expressed, but G3 can. So the resistance is 50%, which is half of wild-type. That would mean that G3's product is necessary for 50% of the resistance. But when both G1 and G3 are knocked out (g1g3), the resistance is 10%. That's lower than 50%, which suggests that when G3 is knocked out alone, G1 is still functional. But if G1 is knocked out in g1g3, maybe G3's product is not the only one needed. Or perhaps G3's function is partially redundant with another gene.

Alternatively, if G1 is a transcription factor that activates G3, then knocking out G1 would reduce the expression of G3. But in the single mutant g1, resistance is 75%, which is higher than the wild-type. Wait, no, the wild-type is 100%, so if G1 is knocked out, the resistance is 75%, which is lower. Wait, no, the wild-type is 100%, so a mutant with 75% resistance is less resistant, meaning more susceptible. So if G1 is knocked out, the plant is 25% less resistant. So G1 is necessary for 25% of the resistance. But if G1 is a transcription factor that activates G3, then knocking out G1 would reduce G3's expression, leading to lower resistance. But wait, in the single mutant g1, resistance is 75%, which is lower than wild-type, so G1's knockout reduces resistance by 25%. Then, in the double mutant g1g3 (both G1 and G3 knocked out), resistance is 10%. If G1 is a transcription factor that activates G3, then knocking out G1 would reduce G3's expression. But in the single mutant g1, G3 is still functional, so the resistance would be less than wild-type. However, in the double mutant g1g3, both G1 and G3 are knocked out, so the resistance is 10%, which is even lower. That suggests that G3's product is necessary for some function, but G1's knockout reduces G3's function. Alternatively, maybe G3 is part of a redundant pathway with another gene, and G1 is part of a different pathway.

Alternatively, let's consider the possibility that G2 is a transcription factor. If G2 is a transcription factor, then its knockout would prevent the activation of downstream genes. Let's see the results:

- g2: 0% resistance. So if G2 is a transcription factor that activates other genes, then its knockout would reduce resistance. If G2's knockout leads to 0% resistance, that suggests that the downstream genes are crucial. But then, in the single mutant g1, G1's knockout leads to 75% resistance. If G1 is not a transcription factor, maybe it's directly involved in a pathway that requires only partial function. For example, if G1 is part of a redundant pathway with G3, then knocking out G1 alone would reduce resistance by 25%, but knocking out both G1 and G3 would reduce it further. Alternatively, if G1 is part of a two-gene pathway, then the single knockout would reduce resistance by half (50%), but the double knockout might go to 25%. But the numbers here don't exactly fit. Let's see:

If G1 and G3 are redundant, then:

- Wild-type: 100% (both genes functional)
- g1: 75% (only G3 functional)
- g3: 50% (only G1 functional)
- g1g3: 25% (no functional genes)

But the actual data is:

g1:75%, g3:50%, g1g3:10%. So this doesn't fit the redundancy model. Because if they were redundant, the double knockout would be 25%, not 10%. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, if G1 is a transcription factor that activates G3. So G2 might be another transcription factor that activates G1. Let's think:

If G2 activates G1, then in wild-type, G2 is expressed, which activates G1. If G2 is knocked out (g2), G1 can't be expressed, leading to 0% resistance. If G1 is knocked out (g1), G2's activation of G1 is gone, so G1 can't be expressed. But G2 is still present, so maybe other pathways are active. Wait, but the single mutant g1 has 75% resistance. So if G1's knockout leads to 75% resistance, that's 25% reduction from wild-type. If G1 is a transcription factor that activates G3, then in the wild-type, G2 activates G1, which then activates G3. If G1 is knocked out (g1), G3 can't be activated, so the resistance is lower. But in the single mutant g1, resistance is 75%, so G3 is only partially required. Alternatively, maybe G3 is directly involved in a different pathway. Let's try to map this out.

Another approach: Look for the double mutants. The double mutants' resistance can tell us about the relationship between the genes.

- g1g2: 0% resistance. So even though G1 is knocked out, G2 is also knocked out. The result is 0%, same as g2. So G2's knockout is the main cause here. So G1's knockout doesn't affect the phenotype when G2 is already knocked out. This suggests that G2 is upstream of G1. In other words, G2's function is not dependent on G1. So if G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1 and possibly other genes, then knocking out G2 would prevent G1 from being expressed. Therefore, in g1g2, G1 is already knocked out, so the function of G2 is the main issue. Hence, the phenotype is similar to g2.

Similarly, g1g3: 10% resistance. So both G1 and G3 are knocked out. The resistance is 10%, which is lower than the single mutants. This suggests that the combined knockout of G1 and G3 has a more severe effect than either single knockout. But how?

If G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3, then in the double mutant g1g3, G2 is still present, but G1 and G3 can't be expressed. However, the resistance is 10%, which is not as low as the wild-type. Wait, but in the single mutant g2, the resistance is 0%, which suggests that G2's knockout is sufficient to cause complete susceptibility. So if G2 is necessary for the expression of both G1 and G3, then in the wild-type, G2 is active, so G1 and G3 are expressed. If G2 is knocked out, G1 and G3 are not expressed, leading to 0% resistance. But in the single mutant g1, G1 is knocked out, but G3 is still expressed. So the resistance would be 50% because G3 is still functional. However, the data shows that in g1, the resistance is 75%, which is lower than 100% by 25%. So perhaps G1 is part of a two-gene pathway with another gene. For example, if G1 and G4 are in a pathway where both are needed, but G4 is not among the mutants. Alternatively, maybe G1's function is partially redundant with G3. Let's think.

Alternatively, G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1. In the wild-type, G2 is active, so G1 is expressed. If G1 is knocked out (g1), G2's activity can't activate G1, but maybe other genes are activated. Wait, but the single mutant g1 has 75% resistance, which is 25% less than wild-type. So perhaps G1 is part of a two-gene pathway where G1 and another gene (say G4) are both necessary. If G1 is knocked out, then G4 can't be expressed, leading to 50% resistance. But in the data, g1 is 75% resistance. That doesn't fit. Alternatively, G1's product is necessary for 25% of the resistance mechanism. So even if G1 is knocked out, the remaining 75% of resistance is still achieved by other genes. But then, in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is even lower. So if G1's knockout reduces resistance by 25%, and G3's knockout reduces resistance by 50%, then the double knockout would reduce resistance by 75% (25% + 50%), but the actual result is 10%, which is 90% of wild-type. So that doesn't add up. Maybe they are redundant. If G1 and G3 are redundant, then knocking out both would reduce resistance by 75% (since 25% from each), but in reality, the double mutant is 10%, which is 90% of wild-type. So that's not matching. So redundancy doesn't explain the double mutant.

Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are both required for a function, but their combined knockout leads to a different phenotype. For example, if G1 is involved in a pathway that, when combined with G3, provides additional resistance. But this is getting complicated.

Let me try another approach. Let's look at the double mutant g1g3 (10% resistance). Since the single mutants g1 (75%), g3 (50%) are both lower than wild-type, but the double mutant is even lower. This suggests that the loss of both G1 and G3 has a more significant effect than the sum of their individual losses. That could happen if G1 and G3 work together in some way, and their combined loss causes a greater disruption. Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are part of the same pathway, and their combined loss leads to a more severe phenotype. However, the numbers don't add up in a straightforward additive way. Let's see:

If G1's knockout reduces resistance by 25% (from 100% to 75%), and G3's knockout reduces resistance by 50% (from 100% to 50%), then the double knockout would reduce resistance by 25% + 50% = 75%, leading to 25% resistance. But the actual double mutant is 10%, which is 90% of wild-type. So that's not matching. Therefore, the genes might not be additive. Maybe G3's knockout is more critical, but when G1 is also knocked out, there's some residual function.

Wait, in the double mutant g1g3, resistance is 10%, which is lower than the single mutant g3 (50%). That suggests that G1's knockout in the presence of G3 knockout leads to a more severe phenotype. So maybe G3's product is necessary for some function, and G1's product is necessary for another function. If both are knocked out, there's no function left, but in the single mutant g3, G1 is still functional, so G1's product is still present. But in g3 alone, resistance is 50%, which might mean that the other gene (G1) is partially functional. But in the double mutant, both are knocked out, leading to 10% resistance. How can that be?

Alternatively, maybe G3's product is required for the expression of another gene that's part of the resistance pathway. For example, if G3 activates G4, which is necessary for resistance. Then, in the wild-type, G3 is active, so G4 is expressed. If G3 is knocked out (g3), G4 isn't expressed, so resistance drops to 50%. If G1 is also knocked out (g1g3), then G4 is not expressed, leading to even lower resistance. But in the double mutant g1g3, resistance is 10%, which would mean that G4 isn't expressed. But how does that connect to the single mutant g1?

Wait, let's think again. If G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. Then:

- In wild-type, G2 is active, so G1 and G3 are expressed. Resistance is 100%.
- In g2, G2 is knocked out, so G1 and G3 can't be expressed. Resistance drops to 0%.
- In g1, G1 is knocked out. But G2 is still present, so G3 is expressed. So resistance would be the same as wild-type minus the contribution of G1. But in the data, g1 has 75% resistance. So maybe G1 is part of a two-gene pathway where both G1 and another gene (say G4) are needed. If G1 is knocked out, G4 can't be expressed, leading to 50% resistance (assuming G4 is necessary for 50% of the resistance). But the data shows 75% resistance, which is a 25% loss. So perhaps G1's knockout reduces resistance by 25%, and G3's knockout reduces resistance by 50%. Then, the double knockout would reduce resistance by 75%, leading to 25%, but the data shows 10%. This inconsistency suggests that this model isn't correct.

Alternatively, maybe G3's knockout in the presence of G1 knockout leads to a more severe phenotype because G3 is a transcription factor that's necessary for the expression of another gene that's part of the resistance. Let's consider:

If G3 is a transcription factor that activates G4, which is necessary for resistance. Then:

- In wild-type, G3 is active, so G4 is expressed. Resistance is 100%.
- In g3, G3 is knocked out, so G4 can't be expressed. Resistance drops to 50% (since G4 is necessary for 50% of the resistance).
- In g1g3, G1 and G3 are knocked out. G4 isn't expressed (since G3 is knocked out), so resistance drops further. But according to the data, g1g3 has 10% resistance. So if G4's expression is needed for 50% of the resistance, and G3's knockout leads to 50% loss, then knocking out G3 would reduce resistance to 50%. If G1 is also knocked out, maybe there's another gene (G5) that's necessary for the remaining 25% of resistance. But the data shows 10%, which is 90% of wild-type. This is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, let's consider that G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. Then:

- In wild-type, G2 is active, so G1 and G3 are expressed. Resistance is 100%.
- In g2, G2 is knocked out, so G1 and G3 can't be expressed. Resistance drops to 0%.
- In g1, G1 is knocked out. But G2 is still active, so G3 is expressed. So resistance is 50% (since G3 is still functional). But the data shows g1 as 75% resistance. So this doesn't fit.
- In g3, G3 is knocked out. G2 is active, so G1 is expressed. Resistance is 50%. But the data shows g3 as 50% resistance. So this fits.
- In g1g3, both G1 and G3 are knocked out. G2 is active, but G1 and G3 can't be expressed. So what's left? If there are other genes that G2 activates besides G1 and G3, their expression would be unaffected. Suppose there's another gene G4 that's necessary for resistance. Then, in g1g3, G4 is expressed (since G2 is active and G4 is another target), leading to resistance of 100% minus the contributions of G1 and G3. But the data shows 10% resistance. So if G1 and G3 are each responsible for 45% of the resistance, but their combined knockout removes 90%, then resistance would be 10%. But this is speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are part of separate pathways, each contributing to the same resistance mechanism. For example, if the resistance mechanism requires both G1 and G3's products working together. Then, in the double knockout, both are non-functional, leading to no resistance. But the data shows 10% resistance, which is still some function. So this might not be the case.

Another angle: The fact that the double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance suggests that the combined loss of G1 and G3 has a more significant effect than either single mutant. If G1 and G3 are in a redundant pathway, then knocking out both would be worse than either single. For example, if G1 and G3 are both necessary for the same function, then knocking out both would lead to a more severe phenotype. But the numbers don't add up for redundancy. Let's see:

If G1 and G3 are redundant, then:

- Single knockout (g1 or g3) would lead to 50% resistance (since each is responsible for 50%).
- Double knockout would lead to 0% resistance (since both are required for full function). But the data shows 10% resistance, so this doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if G3's knockout is more severe than G1's, but that contradicts the data since g3 is 50% and g1 is 75%. So that can't be.

Wait, maybe G2 is acting upstream of both G1 and G3. So G2's activity is necessary for the expression of both G1 and G3. Then:

- In wild-type, G2 is active, so G1 and G3 are expressed. Resistance is 100%.
- In g2, G2 is knocked out, so G1 and G3 can't be expressed. Resistance drops to 0%.
- In g1, G1 is knocked out. But G2 is still active, so G3 is expressed. So resistance is 50% (since G3 is functional). But the data shows g1 as 75% resistance. So this doesn't fit.
- In g3, G3 is knocked out. G2 is active, so G1 is expressed. Resistance is 50% (since G1 is functional). The data shows g3 as 50%, which fits.
- In g1g3, both G1 and G3 are knocked out. G2 is active, so if there's another gene G4 that's necessary for resistance, then G4 would be expressed, leading to 100% resistance. But the data shows 10% resistance. Alternatively, if G2's activity is necessary for the expression of G4, which is part of the resistance. Then, in g1g3, G2 is active, so G4 is expressed. But why would that lead to 10% resistance? Unless G4 is only partially required. This is getting too convoluted.

Perhaps I need to look at the options and see which one fits.

The options are:

A. G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3
B. G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1
C. G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1
D. G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3

First, let's recall what epistasis means. If gene A is epistatic towards gene B, it means that the phenotype of A masks the effect of B. So, if A is non-functional, the phenotype is the same regardless of B. For example, if gene A encodes a component that is required for the function of gene B's product, then if A is knocked out, the effect of B is masked, leading to the same phenotype. Alternatively, in the case of redundancy, if A and B are redundant, then the loss of one masks the effect of the other.

In the given data, the double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance. Since the single mutants g1 and g3 have 75% and 50% respectively, the double mutant's resistance is lower than both. This suggests that the combined loss of G1 and G3 has a more severe effect than either single knockout. This is more consistent with epistasis rather than redundancy. Because in epistasis, the loss of one gene masks the effect of another, leading to a more severe phenotype. For example, if G1 is epistatic towards G3, then the loss of G1 would mask the effect of G3, leading to a more severe phenotype than just the loss of G3. But in the data, the double mutant is more severe than both single mutants, which suggests that the combined loss has a more severe effect, which could be due to epistasis.

Let's analyze the options:

Option A: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy means that a gene affects multiple traits. If G1 and G3 are pleiotropic, their knockout could affect other genes. But the question is about their interaction in the resistance pathway. If G1 is epistatic towards G3, then the loss of G1 would mask the effect of G3. For example, if G1's knockout causes a more severe phenotype regardless of G3's state. But in the data, the double mutant g1g3 has lower resistance than either single mutant, which suggests that the combined loss is more severe. So if G1 is epistatic towards G3, then losing G1 would lead to a more severe phenotype than losing G3 alone. But in the data, the single mutant g3 (50%) is less severe than g1 (75%), which contradicts epistasis. Therefore, this option may not be correct.

Option B: G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

If G1 is a transcription factor, then G1's knockout would lead to reduced resistance. If G2 and G3 are pleiotropic, their knockout could affect other genes. But the question is about their role in the resistance pathway. If G2 is epistatic towards G1, then the loss of G2 would mask the effect of G1. But in the data, the single mutant g2 has 0% resistance, which is more severe than g1's 75%. So if G2 is epistatic towards G1, then losing G2 would lead to a more severe phenotype than losing G1. But the data shows that losing G2 leads to 0%, which is more severe than losing G1 (75%). So this could fit. However, the double mutants would need to be considered. The double mutant g1g2 has 0% resistance, which is same as g2. This fits with epistasis because the loss of G2 masks the effect of G1. The double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance. Since G2 is epistatic towards G1, but G3 is also involved, perhaps G3's product is necessary in addition to G2's. But this is speculative.

Option C: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

If G1 and G3 have the same promoter, they might be part of the same gene. But the problem states they are three distinct genes. If G3 is epistatic towards G1, then the loss of G3 would mask the effect of G1. For example, if G3 is required for the expression of G1's product, then losing G3 would lead to a more severe phenotype than losing G1 alone. But in the data, the single mutant g3 has 50% resistance, which is less severe than g1 (75%). So if G3 is epistatic towards G1, the loss of G3 should be more severe than G1. This contradicts the data, so this option is unlikely.

Option D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

If G1 and G3 are redundant, then their combined knockout would lead to a more severe phenotype. However, if G1 is epistatic towards G3, then the loss of G1 would mask the effect of G3. But in the data, the single mutant g3 has 50% resistance, which is less severe than g1 (75%). If G1 is epistatic towards G3, then the loss of G1 would lead to a more severe phenotype than G3. But in the data, the opposite is true. Therefore, this option is also unlikely.

Between options A and B. Let's revisit the data:

- g1: 75% resistance (25% loss)
- g3: 50% resistance (50% loss)
- g1g3: 10% resistance (90% loss)

If G2 is a transcription factor, and G1 is epistatic towards G3 (Option A), then losing G1 would lead to a more severe phenotype than losing G3. But the data shows the opposite. So Option A is unlikely.

Option B: G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 are pleiotropic, G2 is epistatic towards G1. If G2 is a transcription factor and epistatic towards G1, then losing G2 would lead to a more severe phenotype than losing G1. The data shows g2 (0%) is more severe than g1 (75%), so this fits. The double mutant g1g2 has 0% resistance, same as g2, which fits with epistasis. The double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance. If G2 is epistatic towards G1, then G3's effect is masked by G2. But G3 is also knocked out, so perhaps G3's product is necessary for another function. Alternatively, G3's product is partially necessary. This is still unclear.

Another angle: The double mutant g1g3 has lower resistance than the single mutants. If G3's product is necessary for the expression of another gene that's part of the resistance pathway, then knocking out both G1 and G3 would knock out that gene as well. For example, if G3 activates G4, and G1's product is needed for G4's expression. Then:

- In wild-type, G1 and G3 are both active, G4 is expressed, leading to 100% resistance.
- In g1, G1 is knocked out, G4 can't be expressed (if G1 is required for G4), leading to lower resistance.
But according to the data, in g1, G4 is still functional, leading to 75% resistance. So this doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if G3's knockout leads to the loss of a redundant pathway. For example, if G3's product is part of a redundant pathway with G1. Then, losing both G1 and G3 would lead to loss of both pathways, resulting in lower resistance. But I'm not sure.

Given the time I've spent, I think the correct answer is Option D. But I'm not confident. Let me try to think again.

Wait, another approach: The double mutant g1g2 has 0% resistance. Since g2 alone has 0%, the presence of G1 in the double mutant doesn't affect the phenotype. This suggests that G1's function is not dependent on G2. So G1 is not part of the same pathway as G2. Similarly, the double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance. If G1 and G3 are each part of separate pathways that contribute to the same resistance mechanism, then their combined knockout would have a more severe effect. This could be due to epistasis. If G1 is epistatic towards G3, then the loss of G1 would mask the effect of G3. But in the data, the single mutant g3 (50%) is less severe than g1 (75%), which contradicts epistasis. Alternatively, if G3 is epistatic towards G1, then the loss of G3 would mask the effect of G1. But the data shows the opposite. So this is confusing.

Wait, another angle: The resistance percentages can indicate the relative importance of each gene. Since g2 has the lowest resistance (0%), G2's knockout is the most critical. Then, g1 (75%) and g3 (50%). The double mutants' resistances are even lower than the individual mutants. So G2 is the most critical, followed by G3, then G1. If G2 is a transcription factor necessary for the expression of both G1 and G3, then:

- In wild-type: G2 is active, so G1 and G3 are expressed. Resistance 100%.
- g2: G2 is knocked out, so G1 and G3 can't be expressed. Resistance 0%.
- g1: G1 is knocked out, but G2 is active, so G3 is expressed. Resistance is 50% (assuming G3's expression is sufficient for 50% resistance).
But the data shows g1 as 75% resistance. So this doesn't fit. Alternatively, G1's knockout reduces resistance by 25%, and G3's knockout reduces by 50%. Then, the double knockout would reduce resistance by 75%, leading to 25%, but the data shows 10%. So this is inconsistent.

Alternatively, if G3's knockout leads to a 50% reduction (from 100% to 50%), and G1's knockout leads to a 25% reduction (from 100% to 75%), then the double knockout would lead to 25% + 50% - overlap. But the data shows 10%, which is 90% of wild-type. This suggests that the combined effect is more than additive. Maybe there's a more severe interaction.

Wait, another possibility: G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. So:

- In wild-type: G2 is active, G1 and G3 are expressed. Resistance 100%.
- g2: G2 is knocked out, G1 and G3 can't be expressed. Resistance 0%.
- g1: G1 is knocked out, G2 is active, so G3 is expressed. Resistance 50% (since G3 is expressed, but G1's product is not available. If G1's product is necessary for full resistance, then losing G1 would reduce resistance by 50%. So 100% - 50% = 50% resistance. But the data shows g1 as 75%. So this doesn't fit.
- g3: G3 is knocked out, G2 is active, so G1 is expressed. Resistance 50% (same as above). The data shows g3 as 50%, which fits.
- g1g3: Both G1 and G3 are knocked out. G2 is active, so if there's another gene G4 that's expressed due to G2's activity, but G4's product is partially necessary for resistance. Then, G4's expression would lead to 100% resistance. But the data shows 10%, which is 90% of wild-type. So this doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are part of the same pathway, and their combined knockout leads to a more severe phenotype. For example, if G1 and G3 are both required for the same function. Then, in the double knockout, resistance is lower. But the data shows that the double knockout is 10%, which is lower than either single knockout. This suggests that the combined knockout has a more severe effect, which could be due to epistasis.

Wait, if G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. Then, in the wild-type, all are expressed. If G2 is knocked out (g2), both G1 and G3 are non-functional. Resistance is 0%. If G1 is knocked out (g1), G2 is active, so G3 is expressed. If G3's product is essential for 50% of the resistance, then resistance would be 50%. Similarly, if G3 is knocked out (g3), G1 is expressed, contributing 50% of the resistance. So in double knockout g1g3, G1 and G3 are both non-functional. But if G2 is active, is there another gene that's expressed? If there's a gene G4 that's expressed due to G2's activity and contributes to resistance, then G4 would still be expressed. If G4 contributes 50% of the resistance, then resistance would be 50%. But the data shows 10%, so that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps G1's product is necessary for 25% of the resistance, G3's for 25%, and another gene for 50%. Then, in double knockout, the loss of both G1 and G3 would be 50% + 25% = 75%, so resistance would be 25%. But the data shows 10%. This is not matching.

Another approach: Let's look at the double mutants.

g1g2 has 0% resistance. Since g2 alone has 0%, the presence of g1 doesn't affect the phenotype. This suggests that G1's function is not redundant with G2. Similarly, g1g3 has 10% resistance. So G1's knockout in the presence of G3's knockout leads to a more severe phenotype than either single knockout. This could be due to epistasis. For example, if G3 is epistatic towards G1. If G3 is a transcription factor that activates G1, then in the absence of G3 (g3), G1 can't be expressed, leading to lower resistance. But in the double mutant g1g3, since G1 is already knocked out, the effect of G3's knockout is minimal. However, the data shows that the double mutant has lower resistance than the single mutants, which suggests that the loss of both G1 and G3 leads to a more severe phenotype. This could happen if G1 and G3 are part of the same pathway, and their combined loss leads to a more severe effect than either alone. For example, if G1 and G3 are in a linear pathway, and the loss of both leads to a more severe phenotype. But this is speculative.

Looking back at the options, the correct answer is likely Option D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. But earlier analysis suggested this may not fit. Alternatively, Option B: G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Wait, if G2 is a transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are pleiotropic, then G2's knockout would affect both G1 and G3. But the data shows that g2 alone has 0% resistance, which suggests that G2's knockout is sufficient to knock out both G1 and G3. If G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3, then in the wild-type, G2 is active, so G1 and G3 are expressed. In g2, G2 is knocked out, so G1 and G3 are non-functional. Resistance is 0%. In g1, G1 is knocked out, but G2 is active, so G3 is expressed. Resistance is 50% (if G3's product is necessary for 50% of the resistance). But the data shows g1 as 75%, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe G2's knockout leads to the loss of both G1 and G3. Then, in g2, both are knocked out, leading to 0% resistance. In g1, G1 is knocked out, but G3 is still functional (since G2 is active). If G3's knockout in g3 leads to 50% resistance, but in g1, G3 is functional, leading to higher resistance. But this contradicts the data.

Wait, another possibility: G2 is a negative regulator. If G2 is knocked out, the pathway is activated. But this seems unlikely because the wild-type has 100% resistance.

Alternatively, G2's presence is required for the expression of G1 and G3. If G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. Then:

- Wild-type: G2 is active, G1 and G3 are expressed. Resistance 100%.
- g2: G2 is knocked out, G1 and G3 can't be expressed. Resistance 0%.
- g1: G1 is knocked out. But G2 is active, so G3 is expressed. Resistance 50% (since G3 is functional, but G1's product is missing).
But data shows g1 as 75%, so this doesn't fit.

Alternatively, G1's knockout reduces resistance by 25%, G3's by 50%. Then, the double knockout would reduce resistance by 75%, leading to 25%, but data shows 10%. So this is inconsistent.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that's necessary for the expression of both G1 and G3. So:

- If G2 is knocked out, G1 and G3 can't be expressed. Resistance 0% (g2).
- If G1 is knocked out, G2 is active, so G3 is expressed. If G3 is necessary for 50% of the resistance, then resistance is 50% (g1).
- If G3 is knocked out, G2 is active, so G1 is expressed. Resistance 50% (g3).
- If both G1 and G3 are knocked out, G2 is active, but if there's another gene G4 that's expressed due to G2's activity and contributes to resistance, then G4 would be expressed, leading to resistance of 50%. But the data shows 10%, which is lower. So this doesn't fit.

I'm going in circles here. Let me try to look for the answer among the options again.

The key point is that the double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance. Since g3 alone has 50%, the double mutant is more resistant than g3 alone. Wait, no, 10% is less than 50%, meaning the double mutant is more sensitive. So the resistance is lower. So the double mutant is more severe than either single mutant. This suggests that the genes are in a redundant pathway. But how?

Wait, if G1 and G3 are in a redundant pathway, then the loss of both would be worse than losing either alone. But the data shows the opposite. Therefore, redundancy is unlikely. Therefore, the genes must be part of the same pathway, and their combined knockout has a more severe effect than either single knockout. This is more consistent with epistasis.

If G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3, then:

- In wild-type, G2 is active, so G1 and G3 are expressed. Resistance 100%.
- g2 has 0% resistance (both G1 and G3 are knocked out).
- g1: G1 is knocked out. G2 is active, so G3 is expressed. Resistance is 50% (assuming G3's knockout reduces resistance by 50%).
But data shows g1 as 75%. So this doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps G1's knockout reduces resistance by 25%, and G3's knockout reduces resistance by 50%. Then, the double knockout would reduce resistance by 75%, leading to 25%. But data shows 10%, so this is inconsistent.

Alternatively, if G1's knockout reduces resistance by 50%, and G3's knockout reduces by 50%, the double knockout would have additive effects, leading to 0% (100% - 50% -50% = 0%), but data shows 10%. So this is inconsistent.

Another possibility: G2's knockout leads to the loss of both G1 and G3. Then:

- g2 has 0% resistance (both knocked out).
- g1: G1 is knocked out, but G2 is active, so G3 is expressed. Resistance is 50% (since G3 is functional).
But data shows g1 as 75%, so this is not matching.

Alternatively, G2's knockout leads to the loss of the pathway. G1 and G3 are part of the same pathway. Then:

- Wild-type: 100% resistance.
- g2: 0% (both G1 and G3 knocked out).
- g1: G1 knocked out, but G3 is functional. Resistance is 50% (since G3's function is needed for 50%).
- g3: G3 knocked out, but G1 is functional. Resistance is 50%.
- g1g3: Both knocked out. Resistance is 0% (since the pathway is entirely knocked out). But data shows 10% resistance. So this doesn't fit.

I think I need to consider that the double mutant g1g3 has lower resistance than either single mutant. This suggests that the genes are in a linear pathway, and the loss of both leads to a more severe phenotype. For example, if G1 is upstream of G3, and knocking out G1 and G3 together leads to a more severe phenotype. But this is speculative.

Looking at the options again:

Option D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

If G1 and G3 are redundant, then the loss of either would have the same effect. But the data shows g3 as 50%, which is less severe than g1 (75%). So this contradicts redundancy.

Option B: G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

If G2 is a transcription factor that's epistatic towards G1, then the loss of G2 would mask the effect of G1. For example, if G1's knockout has a certain effect, but when G2 is knocked out, G1's knockout doesn't affect the phenotype. But in the data, the single mutant g1 has 75% resistance, which is less severe than g2 (0%). So if G2 is epistatic towards G1, the loss of G2 would make G1's knockout have no effect. But in the data, G1's knockout has a 75% effect, which contradicts this.

I think the correct answer is Option D. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, Option B might fit if we consider that G2's knockout masks the effect of G1. For example, if G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1. If G2 is knocked out (g2), then G1 can't be expressed, leading to 0% resistance. If G1 is knocked out (g1), but G2 is still active, G1's loss doesn't affect the resistance. But the data shows g1 as 75%, so this contradicts.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is Option D. Let's see:

If G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. Then, in the absence of G2 (g2), both G1 and G3 are non-functional. Resistance 0%. In the absence of G1 (g1), G2 is active, so G3 is expressed. If G3's knockout leads to 50% resistance, then G1's knockout would reduce resistance by 50%, leading to 50%. But the data shows g1 as 75%, so this is inconsistent.

Alternatively, if G2's knockout leads to the loss of both G1 and G3, then:

- g2: 0% (both knocked out)
- g1: G1 knocked out, G2 active, G3 expressed. Resistance 50%
- g3: G3 knocked out, G2 active, G1 expressed. Resistance 50%
- g1g3: Both knocked out. G2 active, but if there's another gene that's expressed due to G2's activity, then resistance might be 50%. But data shows 10%, so this is inconsistent.

I think the correct answer is Option D, but I'm not entirely confident. The reasoning is that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 are redundant, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. This would mean that G1's knockout masks the effect of G3. For example, if G1's knockout leads to a more severe phenotype than G3's. In the data, g1 is 75% and g3 is 50%, so G1's knockout is more severe. If G1 is epistatic towards G3, then the loss of G1 would mask the effect of G3. But in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is even lower. This could mean that the combined loss of both G1 and G3 leads to a more severe phenotype than either alone. This could happen if G1 and G3 are redundant, but the combined loss leads to a more severe effect. However, redundancy would suggest that the combined loss should be the same as the more severe single knockout. But here, the double mutant is even more severe. Therefore, this is confusing.

After all this, I think the correct answer is Option D.
</think>

The question involves analyzing the interactions between three candidate genes (G1, G2, and G3) in the context of a transducin mutant response knockout (wild-type) and four mutant plants (g1, g2, g3, and g1g3). The resistance percentages for these mutants are provided, and the goal is to determine the correct conclusion about their interaction based on the experimental results.

### Key Observations from the Data:
1. **Wild-type (100% resistance):** All three genes (G1, G2, G3) are functional.
2. **Single mutants:**
   - **g1 (75% resistance):** G1 is knocked out, leading to a 25% reduction in resistance (25% loss).
   - **g2 (0% resistance):** G2 is knocked out, leading to complete loss of resistance.
   - **g3 (50% resistance):** G3 is knocked out, leading to a 50% reduction in resistance (50% loss).
3. **Double mutants:**
   - **g1g2 (0% resistance):** Both G1 and G2 are knocked out. The resistance is the same as in g2, indicating that G1 is not redundant with G2.
   - **g1g3 (10% resistance):** Both G1 and G3 are knocked out. The resistance is lower than in either single mutant (g1: 75%, g3: 50%), suggesting a more severe combined effect.
   - **g2g3 (0% resistance):** Both G2 and G3 are knocked out. The resistance is the same as in g2, indicating that G3 is not redundant with G2.

### Analysis of the Options:
#### **Option A: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**
- If G1 is epistatic towards G3, the loss of G1 would mask the effect of G3. However, the data shows that the single mutant g3 (50% resistance) is less severe than g1 (75%), which contradicts this. Additionally, the double mutant g1g3 (10% resistance) being lower than either single mutant suggests epistasis rather than pleiotropy. This option is inconsistent with the data.

#### **Option B: G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**
- If G2 is a transcription factor and epistatic towards G1, the loss of G2 would mask the effect of G1. However, the data shows that the single mutant g1 (75% resistance) is less severe than g2 (0%), which contradicts this. This option is inconsistent with the data.

#### **Option C: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 have the same phenotype, G3 is epistatic towards G1**
- If G1 and G3 have the same phenotype, their knockout would have equivalent effects. However, the data shows that g1 (75% resistance) and g3 (50% resistance) have different phenotypes, which contradicts this. Additionally, the double mutant g1g3 (10% resistance) being lower than either single mutant suggests epistasis rather than redundancy. This option is inconsistent with the data.

#### **Option D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**
- If G1 and G3 are redundant, their combined loss should have a more severe effect than either single knockout. The data shows that the double mutant g1g3 (10% resistance) has a more severe phenotype than either single mutant (g1: 75%, g3: 50%), which is consistent with redundancy. Additionally, if G1 is epistatic towards G3, the loss of G1 would mask the effect of G3. This option is inconsistent with the data.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it aligns with the observed data and explains the phenotypic outcomes of the single and double mutants. 

ANSWER: B
