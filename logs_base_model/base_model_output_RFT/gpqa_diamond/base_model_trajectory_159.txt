Okay, so I need to figure out the angular distance between the first two minima when the aperture is shaped like an infinitely large N-sided polygon, which essentially becomes a circular aperture. The light is monochromatic with wavelength λ, and it's coming along the z-axis, hitting the aperture vertically. The apothems are all the same length a. Since N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle, so the problem is about diffraction through a circular aperture. The question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, assuming small angles where tanθ ≈ θ.

Hmm, first, I remember that for circular apertures, the diffraction minima occur at angles where the path difference corresponds to a half-integer multiple of the wavelength. The formula for the minima in the circular aperture is given by the zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind, specifically the first zero. The first minimum is at the first zero of J1, which is approximately 3.8317 radians. Wait, but wait, maybe I'm mixing up the orders here. Let me think again.

Wait, no, the circular aperture's diffraction minima are given by the zeros of the derivative of the Bessel function of the first kind, Jm', where m is the order. For the first minimum, m=1, so the first zero of J1' is around 3.8317. But I might be confusing this with the circular aperture's diffraction pattern. Alternatively, maybe the angular position of the minima is when the path difference leads to destructive interference. The general formula for the minima in a circular aperture is indeed given by the zeros of the Bessel function derivatives. For the first minimum, it's the first zero of J1', which is approximately 3.8317. But wait, the problem says the apothems are all the same length a. Wait, when N is infinite, the polygon becomes a circle with radius a? Because the apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side, which for a regular polygon with N sides, the apothem a is related to the radius R by a = R cos(π/N). As N approaches infinity, cos(π/N) approaches 1, so the radius R approaches a. So the aperture is a circle of radius a.

Wait, so the aperture is a circular aperture of radius a. Then the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture has minima at angles θ where the first Bessel function derivative J1'(k a sinθ) equals zero. Wait, the diffraction condition is when the path difference from the edges of the aperture leads to destructive interference. The formula for the first minimum is when the path difference is λ/2, but for a circular aperture, the condition is more complex. Let me recall the formula.

The condition for the minima in circular aperture diffraction is given by J1(k a sinθ) = 0, where J1 is the Bessel function of the first kind of order 1. Wait, no, actually, I think it's the zeros of J1. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the orders. Let me check. For a circular aperture, the intensity pattern is proportional to [J1(k a sinθ)/ (k a sinθ)]², so the minima occur where J1(k a sinθ) = 0. The first zero of J1(x) is at x ≈ 3.8317. So the first minimum is when k a sinθ = 3.8317. Then, solving for θ, since k = 2π/λ, we have sinθ ≈ (3.8317)/(2π a / λ) = (3.8317 λ)/(2π a). Wait, but the problem states that the angles are small, so we can approximate sinθ ≈ θ. Therefore, θ ≈ (3.8317 λ)/(2π a). The problem asks for the angular distance between the first two minima. Wait, but wait, the circular aperture only has minima at specific angles. If we're talking about the first two minima, are they the first zero and the second zero? The first zero is at x ≈ 3.8317, the second zero is at x ≈ 7.0156, and so on. So the angular distance between the first and second minima would be the difference in θ between these two zeros. Wait, no, wait, the question says "the first two minima". Wait, but in the far field, the diffraction pattern has a central maximum and then a series of minima and maxima. The first minimum is the first dark ring, then the first maximum after that, then the second minimum, etc. Wait, but the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. Wait, maybe I need to clarify. Let me think again.

Wait, in the far field diffraction pattern of a circular aperture, the intensity pattern has a central bright spot (the Airy disk), then a series of concentric rings. The dark rings correspond to the minima. The first minimum occurs at θ1 where J1(k a sinθ1) = 0, the second minimum at θ2 where J1(k a sinθ2) = 0, and so on. So the first two minima are the first and second zeros of J1. So the angular distance between them is θ2 - θ1. But the problem states "the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large". Wait, but when N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle, so the diffraction pattern is for a circular aperture. So the first minimum is at θ1 = 3.8317/(k a) = 3.8317/(2π a / λ) = (3.8317 λ)/(2π a). The second minimum is at θ2 = 7.0156/(k a) = 7.0156/(2π a / λ) = (7.0156 λ)/(2π a). So the angular distance between the first and second minima would be θ2 - θ1 = [7.0156 - 3.8317]/(2π a / λ) * λ = (3.1839 λ)/(2π a). Let me compute that value. 3.1839 divided by 2π is approximately 3.1839 / 6.2832 ≈ 0.506. So θ2 - θ1 ≈ 0.506 λ / a. Looking at the options, choice C is 0.506 λ/a. So the answer would be C.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let me verify the exact values. The first zero of J1 is indeed approximately 3.8317059, and the second zero is approximately 7.0155866. So the difference is 7.0155866 - 3.8317059 ≈ 3.1838807. Then 3.1838807 divided by 2π is approximately 3.1838807 / 6.2831853 ≈ 0.506. So the difference in θ is 0.506 λ/a. So the correct answer is C. But wait, the problem says "angular distance between the first two minima". Wait, but in the far field, the minima are at θ1, θ2, etc. The first two minima are the first and second zeros. So the angular distance between them is θ2 - θ1, which is approximately 0.506 λ/a. So the answer is C.

Wait, but let me check the options again. The choices are A: 1.220 λ/a, B: 0.500 λ/a, C: 0.506 λ/a, D: 0.610 λ/a. So yes, C is 0.506, which matches our calculation. Therefore, the correct answer is C.
