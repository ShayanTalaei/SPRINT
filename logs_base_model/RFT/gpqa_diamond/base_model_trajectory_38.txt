Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, we have 10,000 identical particles in a system, each moving along the x-axis in a tube. The wave function for each particle is given by ψ(x) = [a / sqrt(1 + x)] - 0.5i. But when we measure their positions, none are found at x < 1 or x > 3. So the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. We need to find the value of 'a' from the options given.

First, I remember that the probability of finding a particle in a certain region is related to the square of the magnitude of the wave function. Since the wave function here is complex (has the imaginary part), the probability density is |ψ(x)|². So the probability of finding the particle between x and x+dx would be |ψ(x)|² dx. Since none are found outside 1 to 3, the integral of |ψ(x)|² from 1 to 3 should be 1 (because the total probability must be 1). But wait, the wave function is defined in a region where the particle can exist, which is between 1 and 3. So the integral over all space should be 1, but since the particle can't be found outside 1 to 3, the wave function must be zero there. Wait, but the given wave function is only defined in x from 1 to 3? Or is the wave function given as valid in that region?

Wait, the problem states that each particle's wave function is described by that expression in a part of space where it can exist. So the wave function is zero outside 1 to 3. So the total integral of |ψ(x)|² from 1 to 3 should equal 1. Because the total probability is 1. So we need to compute the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx and set that equal to 1, then solve for 'a'.

But first, let's compute |ψ(x)|². The wave function is ψ(x) = [a / sqrt(1 + x)] - 0.5i. The magnitude squared is (a / sqrt(1 + x))² + (-0.5)², because for a complex number (p + qi), the magnitude squared is p² + q². So |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1 + x) + 0.25.

Wait, is that right? Let me check. The real part is a / sqrt(1 + x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So when you square the magnitude, it's (real part)^2 + (imaginary part)^2. So yes, that's (a²)/(1 + x) + (0.5)^2 = (a²)/(1 + x) + 0.25.

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [(a²)/(1 + x) + 0.25] dx should equal 1.

Let's set up the integral:

∫₁³ [a²/(1 + x) + 0.25] dx = 1

We can split the integral into two parts:

a² ∫₁³ 1/(1 + x) dx + 0.25 ∫₁³ dx = 1

Compute each integral separately.

First integral: ∫ 1/(1 + x) dx from 1 to 3. Let u = 1 + x, then du = dx. When x=1, u=2; x=3, u=4. So the integral becomes ∫₂⁴ (1/u) du = ln(u) from 2 to 4 = ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

Second integral: ∫₁³ dx = 3 - 1 = 2.

So putting it all together:

a² * ln(2) + 0.25 * 2 = 1

Simplify:

a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1

Subtract 0.5 from both sides:

a² * ln(2) = 0.5

Then, a² = 0.5 / ln(2)

Calculate that. Let's compute ln(2). Natural logarithm of 2 is approximately 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.719

Then a ≈ sqrt(0.719) ≈ 0.848

Looking at the options, the closest is option A: 0.85. But let me check if I did everything correctly.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the integral of 1/(1+x). Let me confirm:

∫₁³ 1/(1 + x) dx = ln(1 + x) from 1 to 3 = ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(2). That's correct.

0.25 * 2 = 0.5. So the equation is a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1 → a² * ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2). Yes.

0.5 divided by approximately 0.6931 is approximately 0.719, square root is about 0.848, which is roughly 0.85, so option A.

But wait, let me check if the wave function is correctly handled. The wave function is given as ψ(x) = [a / sqrt(1 + x)] - 0.5i. So when we square the magnitude, it's (a / sqrt(1 + x))² + (0.5)^2. That's correct. So the integral setup is right.

Alternatively, maybe the wave function is supposed to be normalized. Wait, but the problem says we have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle. The wave functions are normalized for each particle. Because when you have multiple particles, each is normalized. So each ψ(x) must satisfy ∫ |ψ(x)|² dx = 1. But here, the wave function is given over all x, but the particle is only present between 1 and 3. So outside that interval, the wave function is zero. Therefore, the integral from 1 to 3 must be 1.

So the calculation is correct. Therefore, a is approximately 0.848, which rounds to 0.85, option A.

But wait, let me check the options again. The options are A: 0.85, B: 0.35, C: 0.6, D: 1.1. So 0.85 is an option. Therefore, the answer should be A.
