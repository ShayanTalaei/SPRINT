Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate ions. The total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species. The options are A to D.

First, I need to recall what these stability constants represent. Stability constants (β) indicate the formation of complexes. For example, β1 would be the formation constant for the first complex, β2 for the second, and so on. The general formula for the stability constant is β = [Co(SCN)n]/([Co]^initial [SCN]^n). So, higher β values mean more stable complexes.

The problem mentions "blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes." I remember that Co(II) typically forms complexes with different numbers of SCN- ligands. For example, Co(SCN)_n, where n could be 1, 2, 3, etc. The color blue is associated with certain complexes. I think that Co(SCN)_6^3- is a common complex, but maybe the problem is referring to a different one. Wait, the stability constants here go up to β4=16. So maybe the complexes are Co(SCN)_n, with n=1 to 4? Let me think.

But wait, the problem states "blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes." Dithiocyanato suggests more than one SCN ligand. Maybe it's a hexacyanid cobalt complex? But the stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, maybe the numbering is different. Let me check.

Alternatively, perhaps the complexes are Co(SCN)_n where n=1 to 4. The total concentration of Co is 10^-2 M, which is the sum of all the cobalt species, including the free Co^2+ and the complexes. The thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M, which is in excess. But since the problem is about the percentage of the dithiocyanato complexes, maybe it's considering all the complexes formed by Co(II) with varying numbers of SCN ligands.

Wait, the problem says "the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species." So, the "blue" part might be a clue. I think that the hexacyanid cobalt complex, Co(SCN)_6^3-, is typically violet or blue. But the given stability constants don't go up to n=6. Hmm, maybe the problem is considering a different complex. Alternatively, perhaps the "blue" here is a distractor, and we just need to calculate the percentage based on the given β values.

Wait, let's think again. The stability constants are given for β1 to β4. So, the complexes formed would be Co(SCN)_n where n ranges from 1 to 4. Each β represents the formation of a stepwise complex. So, β1 is Co^2+ + SCN^- ↔ CoSCN^+, β2 is CoSCN+ + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_2^2-, and so on. The overall concentration of each complex would be determined by the product of the stability constants and the remaining concentration of SCN^- and Co^2+.

But the problem says "the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes." If the "blue" refers to a specific complex, maybe it's the most stable one, which would be the one with the highest β. Looking at the β values: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, β3 is 63, which is the highest. So maybe the most stable complex is Co(SCN)_3^2-? But I thought Co(SCN)_6^3- is blue. Maybe the problem is using a different numbering for the complexes. Alternatively, maybe the "blue" refers to a particular isomer or oxidation state, but the problem states Co(II), so oxidation state is fixed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering all the complexes formed with different numbers of SCN ligands, and the "blue" ones are the ones with higher stability, so perhaps the majority. But the question is asking for the percentage of the blue complexes among all cobalt species. So, if the highest stability is β3=63, then the complex with three SCN ligands would be the most prevalent. But I need to check the math.

But wait, let's approach this systematically. The total concentration of Co is 10^-2 M. The thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The formation of complexes can be modeled using the stability constants. Let's denote the free Co^2+ concentration as c_free. Then, the concentrations of the complexes can be expressed in terms of c_free and the stability constants.

The total Co concentration is the sum of all species:

c_total = c_free + [CoSCN] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3] + [Co(SCN)_4]

Each of these is formed stepwise. The formation constants are cumulative, so the overall concentration of each complex is c_free multiplied by the product of the stability constants up to that point.

Wait, no. The stability constant βn is the cumulative formation constant for the nth complex. So, for example, β1 = [CoSCN^+]/[Co^2+][SCN^-], β2 = [Co(SCN)_2^2-]/[Co^2+][SCN^-]^2, etc. Therefore, the concentration of each complex can be expressed as:

[CoSCN] = β1 * c_free * [SCN^-]

[Co(SCN)_2] = β2 * c_free * [SCN^-]^2

[Co(SCN)_3] = β3 * c_free * [SCN^-]^3

[Co(SCN)_4] = β4 * c_free * [SCN^-]^4

But wait, the problem states that the total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M, which includes all species. So:

c_total = c_free + β1 * c_free * [SCN^-] + β2 * c_free * [SCN^-]^2 + β3 * c_free * [SCN^-]^3 + β4 * c_free * [SCN^-]^4 = 10^-2

But [SCN^-] is given as 0.1 M. Wait, but actually, [SCN^-] is 0.1 M? Or is it that the total SCN^- concentration is 0.1 M, considering that some is bound in complexes? Wait, the problem says "the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M." So, [SCN^-] = 0.1 M. Therefore, we can substitute [SCN^-] = 0.1 into the equation.

So, the equation becomes:

10^-2 = c_free + β1 * c_free * 0.1 + β2 * c_free * 0.1^2 + β3 * c_free * 0.1^3 + β4 * c_free * 0.1^4

Let me plug in the β values:

β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16

So:

10^-2 = c_free [1 + 9*(0.1) + 40*(0.1)^2 + 63*(0.1)^3 + 16*(0.1)^4]

Let me compute each term inside the brackets:

1 = 1

9*(0.1) = 0.9

40*(0.01) = 0.4

63*(0.001) = 0.063

16*(0.0001) = 0.0016

Adding them up: 1 + 0.9 = 1.9; 1.9 + 0.4 = 2.3; 2.3 + 0.063 = 2.363; 2.363 + 0.0016 = 2.3646

So, 10^-2 = c_free * 2.3646

Therefore, c_free = 10^-2 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.004227 M

Then, the concentration of each complex is:

[CoSCN] = 9 * 0.004227 * 0.1 ≈ 9 * 0.004227 * 0.1 = 0.0038043 M

[Co(SCN)_2] = 40 * 0.004227 * 0.01 ≈ 40 * 0.004227 * 0.01 = 0.0016908 M

[Co(SCN)_3] = 63 * 0.004227 * 0.001 ≈ 63 * 0.004227 * 0.001 = 0.0002663 M

[Co(SCN)_4] = 16 * 0.004227 * 0.0001 ≈ 16 * 0.004227 * 0.0001 = 0.000006763 M

Wait, but the problem mentions "blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes." If the most stable complex is the one with the highest β, which is β3=63, then the majority of the cobalt species would be in the [Co(SCN)_3] complex. However, let's check the percentages.

First, calculate the total of all complexes:

[CoSCN] = ~0.0038043 M

[Co(SCN)_2] = ~0.0016908 M

[Co(SCN)_3] = ~0.0002663 M

[Co(SCN)_4] = ~0.000006763 M

Sum of complexes: 0.0038043 + 0.0016908 = 0.0054951; plus 0.0002663 is 0.0057614; plus 0.000006763 is approximately 0.0057682 M.

But the total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M (0.01 M), so the free Co^2+ is 0.004227 M. The sum of all cobalt species is 0.004227 + 0.0057682 ≈ 0.01, which matches. So that's correct.

Now, the percentage of the "blue" complex, which I think refers to the most stable one, [Co(SCN)_3], would be [Co(SCN)_3] / total cobalt concentration * 100%.

So, [Co(SCN)_3] is approximately 0.0002663 M, and total cobalt is 0.01 M.

Percentage = (0.0002663 / 0.01) * 100% ≈ 2.663%.

But that's only 2.66%, which is not one of the options. The options are 42.3%, 38.1%, 16.9%, 25.6%. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the "blue" refers to a different complex, perhaps the one with three SCN ligands and the fourth one being something else. Wait, maybe the problem is considering only the complexes with fewer SCN ligands. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, considering that the more SCN ligands a complex has, the more stable it is, and thus more prevalent. But according to the calculations, the most stable complex is [Co(SCN)_3], which is 0.266%, which is much less than the options given.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the total concentration of the complexes (excluding the free Co^2+). Let's check the total concentration of all cobalt species, including the complexes and the free ion.

But according to the calculation, the total is 10^-2 M, which includes all cobalt species. So the percentages should be as calculated.

But wait, maybe the problem is asking for the percentage of the blue complexes among all cobalt species, not including the free ion. Let's recalculate.

Total cobalt species (excluding free Co^2+): 0.0038043 + 0.0016908 + 0.0002663 + 0.000006763 ≈ 0.0057682 M

Percentage of [Co(SCN)_3]: 0.0002663 / 0.0057682 ≈ 4.62%

Still not matching the options. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the first few complexes. Let's check the sum up to [Co(SCN)_3].

Sum up to [Co(SCN)_3]: 0.0038043 + 0.0016908 + 0.0002663 ≈ 0.0057614 M

Percentage of [Co(SCN)_3] in this sum: 0.0002663 / 0.0057614 ≈ 4.62%

Still not matching.

Wait, but maybe there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement. The problem says "the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species." So, all cobalt species include the free Co^2+ and the complexes. The total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M, which is the sum of all these. Therefore, the percentage would be [complexes]/[total cobalt] * 100%.

But according to the calculation, [complexes] ≈ 0.0057682 M, so 0.0057682 / 0.01 = 57.68%, which is higher than any of the options. But the options are much lower. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the complexes with four SCN ligands, but that's even less. Or maybe the problem is using a different approach, such as considering only the most stable complex, but even that gives ~2.66%.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Given:

c_total = c_free + β1*c_free*[SCN] + β2*c_free*[SCN]^2 + β3*c_free*[SCN]^3 + β4*c_free*[SCN]^4

We have [SCN] = 0.1 M.

Plugging in:

c_total = c_free [1 + 9*(0.1) + 40*(0.1)^2 + 63*(0.1)^3 + 16*(0.1)^4]

Compute each term:

9*(0.1) = 0.9

40*(0.01) = 0.4

63*(0.001) = 0.063

16*(0.0001) = 0.0016

Sum: 1 + 0.9 = 1.9; +0.4 = 2.3; +0.063 = 2.363; +0.0016 = 2.3646

So c_free = 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.004227 M

Then, each complex:

[CoSCN] = β1*c_free*[SCN] = 9 * 0.004227 * 0.1 = 0.0038043 M

[Co(SCN)_2] = 40 * 0.004227 * 0.01 = 0.0016908 M

[Co(SCN)_3] = 63 * 0.004227 * 0.001 = 0.0002663 M

[Co(SCN)_4] = 16 * 0.004227 * 0.0001 = 0.000006763 M

Sum of complexes: 0.0038043 + 0.0016908 + 0.0002663 + 0.000006763 ≈ 0.005768 M

Total cobalt is 0.01 M, so sum of complexes is 57.68%, free Co is 42.32%. So the percentage of complexes is 57.68%, but the options don't have that. Wait, but the question is asking for the percentage of the blue complexes among all cobalt species. If "blue" is the most stable complex, which is [Co(SCN)_3], then its percentage is 0.0002663 / 0.01 * 100% ≈ 2.66%, which is not an option. If "blue" refers to all complexes (including [Co(SCN)_4]), then 57.68%, but that's not an option either. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the total concentration of the complexes (excluding free Co) is 57.68%, and the question is asking for the percentage of the dithiocyanato complexes (which include all except free Co). But the options don't match. Wait, the options are in the 16-42% range. Maybe I need to re-examine the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the total concentration of the cobalt species is 10^-2 M, which includes all complexes and the free Co. But the question is asking for the percentage of the blue complexes among all cobalt species. If "blue" refers to all the complexes (since cobalt thiocyanate complexes are blue), then the percentage would be 57.68%, but that's not an option. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering only the complexes with four SCN ligands, but that's even less.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the total concentration of the complexes (including all SCN ligands) is 10^-2 M, but that's not the case. The total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M.

Wait, maybe the problem is using a different approach, such as using the formation constants to find the concentration of each species.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the total concentration of the complexes (including all possible SCN ligands) is 10^-2 M. But that would mean the free Co^2+ is negligible, but according to our calculation, it's 42.32%, which is option A. But option A is 42.3%, which would be the percentage of free Co^2+ in the solution. But the question is about the percentage of blue complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the percentage of the complexes (excluding free Co) relative to the total cobalt concentration. So, that would be 57.68%, but that's not an option. The options are 42.3%, 38.1%, 16.9%, 25.6%. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the total concentration of the complexes (including all SCN ligands) is 10^-2 M, but that's not the case. The total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, such as the formula for the concentration of the most stable complex. For example, the concentration of the most stable complex is approximately [Co(SCN)_3], which we calculated as 0.0002663 M, which is 2.66% of the total cobalt. But again, that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the percentage of the blue complex is the concentration of [Co(SCN)_3] divided by the total concentration of all complexes (excluding free Co), which is 57.68%. So 0.0002663 / 0.005768 ≈ 4.62%, which is still not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the cumulative β for the complexes. For example, the cumulative β for the first three complexes is β_total = β1 + β2 + β3 = 9 + 40 + 63 = 112. Then, the concentration of the first three complexes would be c_free * 112 * [SCN]^n, but that's not how stability constants work. Stability constants are cumulative, so β3 = β1*β2*β3 (if each is stepwise). Wait, actually, the stability constant βn is the product of the stepwise constants up to that point. So β3 = β1 * β2 * β3_step. Wait, no, the stability constant for [Co(SCN)_3^2-] is β3 = β1 * β2 * β3_step, where β3_step is the stepwise constant for the third ligand addition. But in this problem, the given β's are the cumulative β's. So, for example, β1 is the formation constant for CoSCN^+, β2 is the formation constant for Co(SCN)_2^2- from CoSCN^+ and SCN^-, and so on. Therefore, the overall concentration of [Co(SCN)_n] is c_free * βn * [SCN]^n. So, the previous calculation is correct.

Given that, the total concentration of complexes is 0.005768 M, and the total cobalt is 0.01 M. So the percentage of complexes is 57.68%, which is not an option. The options are much lower. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the percentage of the most stable complex among all cobalt species, which is [Co(SCN)_3], which is 2.66%, but that's not an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, such as considering that the concentration of the most stable complex is the largest term in the sum. Let's see:

The concentrations are:

[CoSCN] ≈ 0.0038043 M

[Co(SCN)_2] ≈ 0.0016908 M

[Co(SCN)_3] ≈ 0.0002663 M

[Co(SCN)_4] ≈ 0.000006763 M

The largest concentration is [CoSCN] ≈ 0.0038043 M, which is about 38% of the total complexes (since total complexes ≈ 0.005768 M). So 0.0038043 / 0.005768 ≈ 65.8%, which is not an option either.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the concentration of the most stable complex is [Co(SCN)_3], which is 2.66%, but again, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck the numbers.

Given:

Total cobalt = 10^-2 M

[SCN^-] = 0.1 M

Stability constants: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16

The equation is:

10^-2 = c_free [1 + 9*(0.1) + 40*(0.1)^2 + 63*(0.1)^3 + 16*(0.1)^4]

Calculating the terms inside the brackets:

1 + 9*0.1 = 1 + 0.9 = 1.9

1.9 + 40*(0.01) = 1.9 + 0.4 = 2.3

2.3 + 63*(0.001) = 2.3 + 0.063 = 2.363

2.363 + 16*(0.0001) = 2.363 + 0.0016 = 2.3646

So, c_free = 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.004227 M

Then:

[CoSCN] = 9 * 0.004227 * 0.1 ≈ 0.0038043 M

[Co(SCN)_2] = 40 * 0.004227 * 0.01 ≈ 0.0016908 M

[Co(SCN)_3] = 63 * 0.004227 * 0.001 ≈ 0.0002663 M

[Co(SCN)_4] = 16 * 0.004227 * 0.0001 ≈ 0.000006763 M

Total complexes ≈ 0.0038043 + 0.0016908 + 0.0002663 + 0.000006763 ≈ 0.0057681 M

Percentage of [Co(SCN)_3]: 0.0002663 / 0.01 * 100% ≈ 2.663%

Percentage of complexes (sum of all): 0.0057681 / 0.01 * 100% ≈ 57.68%

Neither matches the options. Therefore, perhaps the problem is considering that the concentration of the most stable complex is the dominant one, and the percentage is approximately 38%, which is option B. Wait, 0.0038043 / 0.01 = 38.043%, which is approximately 38.1%, which is option B. So if the problem is asking for the percentage of the most stable complex (which is [CoSCN]) among all cobalt species, then the answer would be 38.1%. But the question says "the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species." If "blue" refers to the most stable complex, which is [CoSCN], then the percentage would be 38.1%, which is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, such as considering that the concentration of the most stable complex is the largest term in the sum, which is [CoSCN] ≈ 38% of the total cobalt concentration. Therefore, the percentage would be approximately 38.1%, which is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the first two complexes. Let's check:

Sum of [CoSCN] and [Co(SCN)_2]: 0.0038043 + 0.0016908 ≈ 0.0054951 M

Percentage: 0.0054951 / 0.01 ≈ 54.95%, which is not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different formula or approach. Let's think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the percentage of the most stable complex (β3=63) among all cobalt species. The concentration of [Co(SCN)_3] is 0.0002663 M, and the total cobalt is 0.01 M. So 0.0002663 / 0.01 = 0.02663, which is 2.66%, not matching. But if we consider the cumulative β up to the third complex, β_total = β1 + β2 + β3 = 9 + 40 + 63 = 112. Then, [Co(SCN)_3] = β3 * c_free * [SCN]^3 = 63 * 0.004227 * 0.001 ≈ 0.0002663. Then, the percentage would still be 2.66%.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the concentration of the most stable complex as [Co(SCN)_3] = (β3 / (β1 + β2 + β3 + β4)) * [SCN]^3. But that's not correct. The stability constants are cumulative, so each complex's concentration is calculated based on the product of the stepwise constants.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the approximation that the most stable complex dominates the distribution. Given that β3=63 is the highest, perhaps the concentration of [Co(SCN)_3] is the dominant species. Let's check the ratio of [Co(SCN)_3] to the total complexes: 0.0002663 / 0.005768 ≈ 4.62%, which is small. However, if we consider only the first three complexes, their sum is 0.0054951 M, which is 54.95% of the total complexes. Then, [Co(SCN)_3] is 2.66% of the total cobalt, but 4.62% of the complexes.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the concentration of the most stable complex as [Co(SCN)_3] = (β3 / (1 + β1 + β2 + β3)) * [SCN]^3. Let's try that:

β3 = 63

Sum of β1, β2, β3: 9 + 40 + 63 = 112

Then, [Co(SCN)_3] = (63 / 112) * [SCN]^3 * c_free

But [SCN] is 0.1, so [SCN]^3 = 0.001

c_free = 0.004227

So [Co(SCN)_3] = (63/112) * 0.001 * 0.004227 ≈ (0.5625) * 0.001 * 0.004227 ≈ 0.000002416 M, which is much lower than before. That doesn't match the previous calculation. Therefore, this approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for each step. For example, the concentration of [Co(SCN)_n] is given by:

[Co(SCN)_n] = β_n * c_free * [SCN]^n

So, for n=1: 9 * 0.004227 * 0.1 = 0.0038043

n=2: 40 * 0.004227 * 0.01 = 0.0016908

n=3: 63 * 0.004227 * 0.001 = 0.0002663

n=4: 16 * 0.004227 * 0.0001 = 0.000006763

Sum: 0.0057681 M

Total cobalt: 0.01 M

Percentage of [Co(SCN)_3]: 0.0002663 / 0.01 * 100% ≈ 2.66%

Percentage of complexes: 0.0057681 / 0.01 * 100% ≈ 57.68%

But the options don't have these numbers. Therefore, perhaps the problem is considering that the concentration of the most stable complex is the largest term in the sum, which is [CoSCN] ≈ 0.0038043 M. Then, the percentage of this complex among all cobalt is 0.0038043 / 0.01 * 100% ≈ 38.04%, which is approximately 38.1%, which is option B.

Therefore, maybe the answer is B. 38.1%.

But why would "blue" correspond to the most stable complex? The problem states "the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species." If "blue" refers to the most stable complex, which is [Co(SCN)_3], but according to the calculation, that's only 2.66%, which is not an option. However, if "blue" refers to all dithiocyanato complexes (which are blue), then the percentage would be 57.68%, which is not an option. Alternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the problem's stability constants. Let me check the stability constants again.

Given β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, perhaps the stability constants are given in a different order. Maybe β1 is for the first ligand, β2 for the second, etc. But that shouldn't affect the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the total concentration of the complexes is given by the sum of the individual terms, and the percentage is calculated accordingly. Let's recheck the calculation:

c_free = 0.004227 M

[CoSCN] = 9 * 0.004227 * 0.1 = 0.0038043 M

[Co(SCN)_2] = 40 * 0.004227 * 0.01 = 0.0016908 M

[Co(SCN)_3] = 63 * 0.004227 * 0.001 = 0.0002663 M

[Co(SCN)_4] = 16 * 0.004227 * 0.0001 = 0.000006763 M

Sum of complexes: 0.0038043 + 0.0016908 + 0.0002663 + 0.000006763 ≈ 0.0057681 M

Total cobalt: 0.01 M

Percentage of complexes: 0.0057681 / 0.01 * 100% ≈ 57.68%

Percentage of [Co(SCN)_3]: 0.0002663 / 0.01 * 100% ≈ 2.66%

But the options don't have these. However, if we consider that the problem is asking for the percentage of the most stable complex (β3=63) among all the complexes, then 0.0002663 / 0.0057681 * 100% ≈ 4.62%, which is not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, such as considering that the concentration of each complex is given by the product of the stability constants up to that point. For example, [Co(SCN)_n] = βn * c_free * [SCN]^n. So, the total cobalt is c_free + β1*c_free*[SCN] + β2*c_free*[SCN]^2 + β3*c_free*[SCN]^3 + β4*c_free*[SCN]^4 = 10^-2.

So, the equation is:

c_free (1 + 9*0.1 + 40*(0.1)^2 + 63*(0.1)^3 + 16*(0.1)^4) = 0.01

Which is the same as before. Therefore, the calculation is correct.

Given that the options don't match, perhaps the problem is considering that the percentage is calculated based on the concentration of the first complex, which is [CoSCN], which is 38.04%, option B. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the percentage is calculated by taking the concentration of the most stable complex divided by the total cobalt concentration, which is 2.66%, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for the total cobalt concentration. Wait, the problem states that the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the total cobalt concentration is the sum of the free ion and all the complexes, which it is. Therefore, the calculation is correct, but the options don't match, which suggests that there might be an error in the problem statement or the options.

But since the options are provided, and the calculation leads to approximately 38.1% for the most stable complex, which is option B, perhaps that's the intended answer. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the concentration of the most stable complex as the only complex, which would be 2.66%, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the concentration of the most stable complex is the sum of all the complexes, which is 0.0057681 M. Then, the percentage would be 57.68%, which is not an option. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is B, 38.1%, considering the most stable complex as the dominant one. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, such as considering that the concentration of the most stable complex is approximately equal to the total concentration multiplied by the ratio of β3 to the sum of all β's. Let's check:

Sum of β's: 9 + 40 + 63 + 16 = 128

Ratio: 63 / 128 ≈ 0.492

Then, 0.492 * 10^-2 M = 0.00492 M

Percentage: 0.00492 / 0.01 * 100% = 49.2%, which is not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different formula. For example, the concentration of the most stable complex is [Co(SCN)_3] = (β3 / (1 + β1 + β2 + β3 + β4)) * [SCN]^3 * c_free. But that's not correct, as the stability constants are cumulative. Therefore, I think the intended answer is B, 38.1%, as the percentage of the most stable complex (if "blue" refers to that), even though the calculations don't exactly match.
