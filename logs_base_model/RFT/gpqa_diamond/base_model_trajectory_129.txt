Okay, so I need to figure out the lower limit on the redshift of these neutral hydrogen clouds so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The question mentions that these clouds absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength of about 1216 Angstrom. Hmm, I remember that the Lyman series is the series of transitions in hydrogen where the electron moves from higher energy levels to the first energy level (n=1). The Lyman alpha line is the transition from n=2 to n=1, right? And that's in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. But since these clouds are absorbing the light from quasars, which emits light across the spectrum, the absorption line would shift due to the expansion of the universe, causing a redshift.

Wait, so the Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstrom. If the cloud is at a certain redshift, the observed wavelength would be longer. But ground-based telescopes can only see certain wavelengths. I think the human eye can only see from about 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red), but optical telescopes can observe a bit beyond that into near-infrared maybe? Or does it vary depending on the instrument? The question says "optical ground-based telescopes," so maybe they can only observe up to a certain wavelength. Let me recall. The Lyman series is in the UV, but when redshifted, the Lyman alpha line might shift into the optical or near-infrared range. So the cloud needs to be close enough (low enough redshift) that the Lyman alpha line is still in the wavelength range that ground telescopes can observe.

Wait, but the question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift. Lower redshift means the emission is less redshifted. Wait, no. Wait, redshift z is defined as (observed wavelength / emitted wavelength) - 1. So if the emitted wavelength is 1216 Angstrom (which is 0.1216 microns, or 121.6 nm), and the observed wavelength λ_obs is such that it's detectable by the telescopes. So we need to find the minimum z such that λ_obs is within the observable range of ground-based telescopes.

But wait, ground-based telescopes can't see UV. They can see optical and maybe some near-infrared. Let's check: typical optical telescopes can observe from about 400 nm (V) to 700 nm (R), but some can go a bit beyond into near-infrared. However, Lyman alpha is 1216 Angstrom, which is 121.6 nm. So if the cloud is at a redshift z, the observed wavelength is λ_obs = (1 + z) * 1216 Angstrom. We need this to be in the range that ground telescopes can observe. So the maximum λ_obs that can be observed would be when it's just entering the near-infrared range. Let's assume that ground telescopes can observe up to maybe 1 micron (1000 nm), but that's a very rough estimate. Alternatively, the maximum wavelength they can observe might be around 1 micron (since 1 micron is 1000 nm, but some telescopes might not go that far). So if we take the maximum λ_obs as 1 micron (1000 nm), then solving for z:

1000 nm = (1 + z) * 1216 nm

So (1 + z) = 1000 / 1216 ≈ 0.822

Wait, that can't be right because (1 + z) can't be less than 1. Wait, that would give z negative, which isn't possible. So maybe the maximum λ_obs that can be observed is up to the near-infrared limit. Let's check what's the near-infrared range. Near-infrared starts around 0.7 microns (700 nm) to maybe 2.5 microns. But ground-based telescopes, especially optical ones, might not go that far. Let's say the maximum observable wavelength is around 1 micron (1000 nm). Then:

λ_obs = (1 + z) * 1216 Angstrom = (1 + z) * 121.6 nm

Set that equal to 1000 nm:

(1 + z) = 1000 / 121.6 ≈ 8.22

Wait, that would mean z ≈ 7.22. But that's a high redshift. Wait, but the question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift. Wait, lower redshift means smaller z. So if the cloud is at a higher redshift, the observed wavelength is longer. So to have the Lyman alpha line still in the observable range, the redshift can't be too high. Wait, but the question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift. Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly.

Wait, the problem states "estimate the lower limit on the redshift of this objects such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes." So the lower limit on redshift would be the minimum redshift (smallest z) where the absorption line is still detectable. But wait, lower redshift means less expansion, so the observed wavelength is closer to the emitted wavelength. If the cloud is too close (low redshift), the Lyman alpha line would be in the UV, which ground telescopes can't see. So to detect the absorption line, the cloud must be at a redshift where the observed wavelength is in the range that ground telescopes can observe. So the minimum redshift is when the observed wavelength is at the maximum observable wavelength. Wait, no. If the cloud is at a higher redshift, the observed wavelength is longer. So to have the line in the observable range, the observed wavelength must be less than or equal to the maximum wavelength that can be observed. Wait, no. Wait, if the cloud is at a higher redshift, the observed wavelength is longer. So if the maximum observable wavelength is, say, 1 micron (1000 nm), then the cloud's redshift would be (1000 / 121.6) - 1 ≈ 8.22 -1 = 7.22. But that's a very high redshift. But the question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift. Wait, maybe I'm getting this backwards. Let me think again.

Wait, the Lyman alpha line is emitted at 1216 Angstrom. If the cloud is at redshift z, the observed wavelength is 1216*(1+z) Angstrom. To be detectable by ground telescopes, this observed wavelength must be in the range that they can observe. The ground-based telescopes can observe from about 400 nm (visible light) up to maybe 1 micron (in the near-infrared). So let's say the maximum observable wavelength is 1000 nm. Then:

1216*(1+z) = 1000 nm

Wait, but 1216 Angstrom is 121.6 nm. Wait, so 121.6*(1+z) = 1000 nm → 1+z = 1000 / 121.6 ≈ 8.22 → z ≈ 7.22. But that's a very high redshift, which is more than typical for large-scale structures. Wait, but maybe the maximum observable wavelength is 1 micron (1000 nm), but Lyman alpha is 121.6 nm, so if 121.6*(1+z) = 1000 nm → z ≈ 7.22. But that's a really high redshift. However, the question says "lower limit on the redshift", which would be the minimum z such that the absorption is detectable. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the terms. The lower limit on redshift would be the smallest z where the absorption line is just visible. But if the cloud is at a lower z (closer object), the observed wavelength is shorter (bluer), so maybe in UV, which isn't visible. So to have the absorption line in the detectable range (optical/near-infrared), the cloud must be at a redshift where the observed wavelength is at least in the detectable range. Wait, but lower redshift would mean the observed wavelength is shorter (since z is small, so (1+z) is small). Wait, no. Wait, z is (observed wavelength - emitted wavelength)/emitted wavelength. So higher z means longer observed wavelength. So to get the observed wavelength into the detectable range (from about 400 nm to 1 micron), the cloud must be at a z such that 121.6*(1+z) is within 400 nm to 1000 nm. So the minimum z is when 121.6*(1+z) = 400 nm → 1+z = 400/121.6 ≈ 3.299 → z ≈ 2.299. The maximum z is when 121.6*(1+z)=1000 → z≈7.22. But the question asks for the lower limit on redshift. Wait, the lower limit would be the minimum z where the line is detectable. Wait, but if the cloud is at z=2.299, the observed wavelength is 400 nm (which is violet, just into the visible range). But ground telescopes can't observe UV. Wait, optical telescopes start at about 400 nm (violet) but they can't observe much below that. So if the cloud is at z=2.3, the observed wavelength would be 400 nm, which is near the edge of what optical telescopes can observe. But maybe the question is considering that the Lyman alpha line is in the optical when redshifted. Let's check: 1216 Angstrom is 121.6 nm. Let's compute for different redshifts:

If z=1.2 → observed wavelength = 1216*(1+1.2) = 1216*2.2 = 2675.2 Angstrom = 267.52 nm → that's in the UV, still not visible to ground telescopes. So that's not detectable.

If z=1.9 → observed wavelength = 1216*(2.9) = 35264 Angstrom = 352.64 nm → still UV. Wait, that's even higher. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation. Let me recalculate. 1216 Angstrom is 0.1216 micrometers. If z=1.2, then (1+1.2)=2.2 → 0.1216 *2.2=0.2675 micrometers = 267.5 nm. UV. So that's not visible. For z=2.4: 0.1216*(3.4)=0.4134 micrometers = 413.4 nm. That's visible (blue-green). So if the cloud is at z=2.4, the observed wavelength would be 413.4 nm, which is blue, detectable by ground telescopes. So the lower limit on redshift would be the minimum z where the observed wavelength is just in the detectable range. But what's the exact cutoff? The emitted wavelength is 1216 Angstrom. Let's say ground telescopes can detect up to 1 micron (1000 nm). So solving 1216*(1+z) = 1000 → 1+z = 1000/1216 ≈ 0.822 → z ≈ -0.178. That's impossible. Wait, that's not right. Wait, 1216 Angstrom is 121.6 nm. 121.6*(1+z) = 1000 nm → 1+z = 1000/121.6 ≈ 8.22 → z ≈ 7.22. But that's way too high. But maybe the maximum wavelength a ground telescope can observe is 1 micron (1000 nm), so the observed wavelength can't be longer than that. Wait, but the Lyman alpha line would be at 121.6*(1+z) nm. So for it to be observable, this must be less than or equal to the maximum wavelength the telescope can observe. Let's say the maximum is 1000 nm. Then z = (1000/121.6) -1 ≈ 8.22 -1 = 7.22. But that's a very high redshift. But the question is asking for the lower limit on redshift. Wait, perhaps the question is considering that the Lyman alpha line is in the near-infrared when redshifted. Let's check when 121.6*(1+z) is around 1 micron (1000 nm). That gives z≈7.22. But that's not an option. The options are 1.2, 1.9, 2.4, 3. So maybe I'm miscalculating. Wait, perhaps the maximum wavelength detectable is shorter. Let's see. Ground-based telescopes can observe up to about 1 micron (1000 nm) in the near-infrared. But maybe the Lyman alpha line, when redshifted, enters the near-infrared. Let's compute for z=1.9: 1216*(1+1.9)=1216*2.9=3526 Angstrom=352.6 nm. That's UV. For z=2.4: 1216*3.4=4134 Angstrom=413.4 nm. That's blue light, which is visible. For z=3: 1216*4=4864 Angstrom=486 nm. Still blue. Wait, but when z=3, the observed wavelength is 486 nm, which is blue. So that's detectable. But if the cloud is at z=1.9, the observed wavelength is 352.6 nm (UV), which isn't visible. So the lower limit on redshift would be the minimum z where the observed wavelength is in the detectable range. So if the detectable range starts at 400 nm (violet), then 1216*(1+z) >=400 nm. Solving for z: (1+z) >=400/1216 ≈0.3299 → z >= -0.67. But since z can't be negative, the lower limit would be z=0. But that's not possible. Wait, maybe the question is considering that the Lyman alpha line must be in the optical range. Let's think again. The Lyman series is in UV, but when redshifted, could it fall into the optical? For example, if z=1, then 1216*2=2432 Angstrom=243.2 nm (still UV). z=2: 1216*3=3648 Angstrom=364.8 nm (still UV). z=3: 1216*4=4864 Angstrom=486.4 nm (blue). So at z=3, it's in the blue. So the lower limit would be z=3. But the options have 3 as option A. But the question is asking for the lower limit on redshift such that they can be detected. Wait, but if the cloud is at z=3, the observed wavelength is 486.4 nm (blue), which is visible. If the cloud is at z=1.2, observed wavelength is 267.5 nm (UV, not visible). So the minimum z where the line is in the visible range is z= (400/121.6) -1 ≈ 3.29 -1 ≈ 2.29. So z≈2.3. But the options don't have 2.3. The closest is option C (2.4). So maybe the answer is 2.4. But wait, let's check the options again. The choices are A.3, B.1.9, C.2.4, D.1.2. So 2.4 is option C. But according to my calculation, the minimum z is around 2.29, so 2.3. But since the options don't have that, perhaps the answer is 2.4. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering that the Lyman alpha line is in the near-infrared. Let's check for z=1.9: 1216*(1+1.9)=1216*2.9=3526 Angstrom=352.6 nm (UV). For z=2.4: 1216*3.4=4134 Angstrom=413.4 nm (blue). So the line would be in the visible range for z≥2.3. The closest option is 2.4. But why is the question asking for the lower limit? Like, the minimum z where it's detectable. So 2.4 would be the minimum z where it's in the visible range. But wait, the question says "estimate the lower limit on the redshift of this objects such that they can be detected". So the lower limit would be the smallest z where the line is detectable. So if at z=2.3, the line is just visible (413.4 nm is blue), then the lower limit would be 2.3. But since the options don't have that, maybe the answer is 2.4. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering that the Lyman alpha line is in the near-infrared when redshifted. Let's compute when 1216*(1+z)=1000 nm → z= (1000/121.6)-1 ≈ 8.22-1=7.22. But that's a high redshift. But none of the options are near that. Wait, maybe the maximum wavelength ground telescopes can observe is 1 micron (1000 nm). But Lyman alpha is 1216 Angstrom=121.6 nm. So 121.6*(1+z)=1000 → z≈7.22. But that's not an option. So perhaps the question is considering the maximum wavelength in the optical range. Let's say ground telescopes can observe up to, say, 900 nm (near-infrared). Then 121.6*(1+z)=900 → z≈ (900/121.6)-1≈7.39-1=6.39. Still not an option. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering that the Lyman alpha line is emitted at 1216 Angstrom (121.6 nm) and the ground telescopes can observe up to 1 micron (1000 nm), so the maximum z is 7.22. But the question is about the lower limit on redshift. Wait, maybe the question is asking for the minimum redshift where the Lyman alpha line is redshifted into the optical. So the minimum z where 1216*(1+z) is in the optical. Let's say the optical starts at around 400 nm. Then 400 = 121.6*(1+z) → z = (400/121.6)-1 ≈3.29-1≈2.29. So the lower limit on redshift is approximately 2.29. The closest option is 2.4 (option C). Therefore, the answer should be C. But let me check the options again. The options are A.3, B.1.9, C.2.4, D.1.2. So 2.4 is the closest to 2.29. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the Lyman alpha line is observable in the near-infrared. Let's compute for z=1.9: 121.6*(2.9)=352.64 nm (UV). z=2.4: 121.6*3.4=413.4 nm (blue). So if the telescope can observe up to 1 micron (1000 nm), then z=7.22. But the question is about the lower limit, so the minimum z where it's detectable. So the answer should be z≈2.29, which is closest to 2.4. Therefore, the correct answer is C.2.4.

To estimate the lower limit on the redshift of the neutral hydrogen clouds such that their Lyman alpha absorption line at 1216 Angstrom can be detected by optical ground-based telescopes, we consider the redshifted wavelength observed by the telescopes. The Lyman alpha line is emitted at 1216 Angstrom (121.6 nm) and is absorbed by the cloud. For the absorption line to be detectable, the observed wavelength must lie within the range that ground-based telescopes can observe. Ground-based telescopes typically observe wavelengths from about 400 nm (visible light) to 1000 nm (near-infrared).

The observed wavelength is related to the emitted wavelength and redshift by the formula:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{emitted}} \times (1 + z)
\]

Rearranging for redshift \( z \):

\[
z = \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}}}{\lambda_{\text{emitted}}} - 1
\]

For the Lyman alpha line to be in the detectable range, we calculate the minimum redshift where the observed wavelength is at least 400 nm:

\[
z = \frac{400 \, \text{nm}}{121.6 \, \text{nm}} - 1 \approx 3.29 - 1 = 2.29
\]

Thus, the lower limit on the redshift is approximately 2.29. Among the given options, the closest value is 2.4. Therefore, the correct answer is:
