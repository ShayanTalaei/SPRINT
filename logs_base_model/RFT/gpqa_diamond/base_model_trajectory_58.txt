Okay, so I need to find the pH of this solution that's a mix of acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. Let me start by recalling some chemistry concepts. The problem involves combining different solutions, so I think I need to calculate the moles of each component first. Then, determine the net ions after they react. Since the question is about pH, the solution is probably a buffer or maybe a strong acid/base solution, but I need to check.

First, let me jot down the volumes and concentrations of each solution:

- CH3COOH (acetic acid): 500 mL of 0.1 M
- HCl (hydrochloric acid): 400 mL of 0.2 M
- Ba(OH)2 (barium hydroxide): 300 mL of 0.3 M

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, right? So it dissociates completely in water. Similarly, HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate much initially, but maybe if there's excess strong base, it could react with it.

So the first step is to calculate the moles of each substance.

For CH3COOH: moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.1 M × 0.5 L = 0.05 moles. But wait, acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate much, but maybe when we mix with other strong acids or bases, we need to consider neutralization.

HCl: 0.2 M × 0.4 L = 0.08 moles. Since HCl is a strong acid, it will dissociate completely into H+ and Cl-.

Ba(OH)2: The formula is Ba(OH)2, which dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- per formula unit. So moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Each mole gives 2 moles of OH^-, so total OH^- is 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, when these are mixed, the H+ from HCl and the OH^- from Ba(OH)2 will react. Strong acid and strong base will neutralize each other. Let's calculate the net H+ or OH^- after this reaction.

Total H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles (since it's 1:1 H+).

Total OH^- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 moles (since each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH^-).

So the reaction between H+ and OH^- is H+ + OH^- → H2O. Let's subtract the moles:

H+ (0.08) reacts with OH^- (0.18). The OH^- is in excess. So after reaction:

Moles of OH^- remaining = 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles.

So the solution after mixing HCl and Ba(OH)2 will have 0.10 moles of OH^- left. But wait, what about the acetic acid? Because acetic acid is a weak acid, but when we mix it with OH^-, it will react as well. Wait, but the OH^- comes from the strong base Ba(OH)2, so maybe the OH^- will first neutralize the H+ from HCl, and then any excess OH^- will react with the acetic acid. Let me think.

Wait, the initial reaction between HCl and Ba(OH)2 is:

HCl (aq) + Ba(OH)2 (aq) → BaCl2 (aq) + H2O (l)

The balanced equation is 2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O. Wait, but the stoichiometry here is important. Let me check that again.

The reaction between HCl and Ba(OH)2 is:

Ba(OH)2 + 2 HCl → BaCl2 + 2 H2O

So the mole ratio is 1 mole Ba(OH)2 reacts with 2 moles HCl.

So in our case, we have 0.08 moles HCl and 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2.

Wait, but based on the stoichiometry, 1 mole Ba(OH)2 needs 2 moles HCl. So 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2 would need 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 moles HCl. But we only have 0.08 moles HCl. So HCl is the limiting reactant here. Therefore, all the HCl would react with some Ba(OH)2, and there would be excess Ba(OH)2 left.

Wait, but this is a neutralization reaction. Let's calculate how much Ba(OH)2 reacts with HCl.

From the reaction: 2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O.

So moles needed for complete reaction: HCl: 0.08, Ba(OH)2: 0.08 / 2 = 0.04 moles. But we have 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2. So Ba(OH)2 is in excess.

So after reaction:

Moles of Ba(OH)2 remaining = 0.09 - 0.04 = 0.05 moles.

And all HCl is consumed. So the Ba(OH)2 remaining is 0.05 moles. Each mole gives 2 OH^-, so OH^- = 0.05 × 2 = 0.10 moles.

Now, the solution also contains acetic acid. But acetic acid is a weak acid and doesn't react with OH^- because it's a weak acid. Wait, but OH^- is a strong base. Wait, no: OH^- is a conjugate base of water. Wait, no, OH^- is a strong base. Wait, but in solution, the presence of OH^- would make the solution basic. But we also have the acetic acid, which is a weak acid. So the OH^- would deprotonate the acetic acid.

Wait, but acetic acid is a weak acid, so in the presence of strong base (OH^-), the OH^- would react with the acetic acid. Let me think.

The reaction between OH^- and CH3COOH:

CH3COOH + OH^- → CH3COO^- + H2O

Since OH^- is a strong base, it would deprotonate the acetic acid. So the OH^- from the Ba(OH)2 will react with the acetic acid.

So after the initial reaction between HCl and Ba(OH)2, we have 0.05 moles Ba(OH)2 left, which gives 0.10 moles OH^-.

Additionally, the acetic acid (0.05 moles) will react with OH^-.

So moles of OH^- after reacting with acetic acid:

Total OH^- from Ba(OH)2: 0.10 moles.

Moles of CH3COOH: 0.05 moles.

Reaction: OH^- + CH3COOH → CH3COO^- + H2O

So each mole of OH^- reacts with one mole of CH3COOH. Since we have 0.10 moles OH^- and 0.05 moles CH3COOH, all the CH3COOH will be neutralized, and 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles OH^- remain.

Wait, but wait. The OH^- is 0.10 moles from Ba(OH)2. We have 0.05 moles CH3COOH. So OH^- will react with CH3COOH in a 1:1 ratio. So 0.05 moles of OH^- will neutralize 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, leaving 0.05 moles of OH^- remaining. The remaining OH^- is from Ba(OH)2 after neutralizing the acetic acid.

So the final solution would have 0.05 moles of OH^- in the total volume. Let me check the total volume.

Total volume is 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So concentration of OH^- is moles / volume = 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.041666... M.

Then, the pH can be found using pOH = -log[OH^-], so pOH ≈ log(1/0.041666) ≈ log(24) ≈ 1.38. Wait, but that would make pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62. But that's one of the options (B). But wait, I might have made a mistake here. Let me double-check.

Wait, let's go step by step again.

First, calculate the initial moles:

CH3COOH: 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 mol.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol. Since each mole gives 2 OH^-, total OH^- is 0.18 mol.

Now, the reaction between HCl and Ba(OH)2:

The balanced equation is 2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O.

So moles required for complete reaction:

For HCl: 2 moles per 1 mole Ba(OH)2. So 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2 needs 0.18 mol HCl. But we have only 0.08 mol HCl. So HCl is the limiting reactant.

Moles of Ba(OH)2 that can react with HCl: 0.08 mol HCl / 2 = 0.04 mol Ba(OH)2.

So Ba(OH)2 remaining: 0.09 - 0.04 = 0.05 mol. This gives 0.05 * 2 = 0.10 mol OH^-.

Now, the OH^- from Ba(OH)2 (0.10 mol) reacts with CH3COOH. The reaction is:

CH3COOH + OH^- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

Moles of CH3COOH: 0.05 mol.

Moles of OH^-: 0.10 mol.

So OH^- will neutralize all CH3COOH (0.05 mol), leaving OH^- remaining: 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol.

Total volume after mixing: 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

Concentration of OH^-: 0.05 mol / 1.2 L = 0.041666... M ≈ 0.04167 M.

pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38. Therefore, pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62. So the answer would be B.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because the presence of excess OH^- would make the solution basic, but the acetic acid is a weak acid. However, the OH^- from the base would react with the acetic acid, converting it to acetate ions. So the solution would consist of acetate ions and excess OH^-.

But wait, acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid. If there's excess OH^-, which is a strong base, then the solution would be basic. However, the acetate ions would hydrolyze in water, but since the solution is already strongly basic, the pH would be determined by the excess OH^-.

Wait, but when you mix a weak acid with a strong base, the solution's pH depends on the amount of excess base after neutralization. So in this case, after neutralizing the acetic acid with OH^-, the remaining OH^- would make the solution basic. So the pH is determined by the concentration of OH^-.

But wait, maybe I missed something. Let's recalculate the moles.

Total moles of OH^- after HCl and Ba(OH)2 reaction: 0.10 mol.

Total moles of CH3COOH: 0.05 mol.

So OH^- reacts with CH3COOH in 1:1 ratio. So 0.05 mol OH^- reacts with 0.05 mol CH3COOH, leaving 0.05 mol OH^- unreacted. The remaining OH^- is 0.05 mol in 1.2 L, so 0.04167 M.

pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38. pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62. So answer B.

But wait, the answer options include 8.68 as D and 8.92 as A. Why are the pH values so high? Because the solution is strongly basic, right? But maybe I made a mistake in the stoichiometry.

Wait, let me check the moles again.

Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol. Since each mole gives 2 OH^-, that's 0.18 mol OH^-.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 mol H+.

So H+ from HCl is 0.08 mol. OH^- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18 mol.

They react in 1:1 ratio. So H+ (0.08) reacts with OH^- (0.18), leaving OH^- (0.10 mol).

Then, the OH^- (0.10 mol) reacts with CH3COOH (0.05 mol). Each OH^- reacts with 1 mol CH3COOH.

So OH^- is 0.10, CH3COOH is 0.05. So all CH3COOH is neutralized, leaving OH^- 0.05 mol.

So total OH^- is 0.05 mol in 1.2 L. Concentration is 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.041666 M.

pOH = -log(0.041666) ≈ 1.38. pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62. So B.

But why is option D 8.68? Maybe I made a mistake in the neutralization steps. Let me consider another approach.

Wait, perhaps the OH^- from Ba(OH)2 is in excess after neutralizing the HCl. Then, the OH^- also reacts with the acetic acid, but maybe the solution is not just a simple strong base solution. Because when you mix a weak acid with a strong base, the pH isn't just determined by the excess OH^- if the weak acid's conjugate base is present. Wait, but in this case, the excess OH^- would dominate the pH because it's a strong base. The acetate ions from the neutralization would hydrolyze, but in a strongly basic solution, their contribution is negligible.

Wait, acetate ions (CH3COO^-) are the conjugate base of acetic acid. They would hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

But in a solution where OH^- concentration is already 0.04167 M, the hydrolysis of acetate would produce more OH^-. However, the OH^- concentration from the acetate's hydrolysis would be much smaller than the 0.04167 M from the excess base. So the pH would still be determined by the excess OH^-.

Alternatively, maybe the initial assumption is correct, and the pH is 12.62, which is option B. But let me check the answer options again.

Options are:

A. 8.92

B. 12.62

C. 1.38

D. 8.68

So B is 12.62, which is a very basic pH. That makes sense because after all the OH^- is in excess. But why is option D 8.68? Maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the solution is not just a simple mixture. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: Since Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, and HCl is a strong acid, their reaction would produce water, and then the resulting solution would have excess OH^- from Ba(OH)2. Then, the CH3COOH (weak acid) would react with this OH^- to form acetate ions. But in this case, the OH^- is in excess, so the solution is basic. Therefore, the pH should be high.

But maybe I made a mistake in the stoichiometry. Let me recalculate the moles.

Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol. Each mole gives 2 OH^-, so 0.18 mol OH^-.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 mol H+.

They react in 1:1 ratio. So H+ (0.08) reacts with OH^- (0.08), leaving OH^- (0.18 - 0.08) = 0.10 mol.

Then, the CH3COOH (0.05 mol) reacts with OH^- (0.10 mol). The reaction is:

CH3COOH + OH^- → CH3COO^- + H2O

Moles of CH3COOH: 0.05 mol.

Moles of OH^- available: 0.10 mol.

So they react completely, OH^- remaining: 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol.

Total volume is 1.2 L. So [OH^-] = 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.04167 M.

pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38. pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62. So answer B.

Therefore, the correct answer should be B. But let me check if there's any other factor I'm missing, like activity coefficients or temperature, but the problem doesn't mention that. So the answer is B.
