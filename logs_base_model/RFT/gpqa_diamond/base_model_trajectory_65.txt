Okay, so I need to figure out which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. Let's start by recalling what SMEFT stands for. SMEFT is the Effective Field Theory (EFT) for the Standard Model, right? It's used to parameterize possible new physics beyond the Standard Model in a systematic way. The operators in SMEFT are organized by dimension and suppressed by some high-energy scale Î›.

The question asks which of the given symmetries must all operators in SMEFT respect. The options are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincare symmetry (2), CP symmetry (3), and CPT symmetry (4). The choices are combinations of these. Let me think through each symmetry.

First, Lorentz symmetry. SMEFT is built on the Standard Model, which already incorporates Lorentz symmetry. The effective operators are constructed with Lorentz-invariant terms, so any operator included in SMEFT should respect Lorentz symmetry. So 1 and 2 must be correct. Wait, but Poincare symmetry is a combination of Lorentz and spacetime translations. Since Lorentz is part of Poincare, if SMEFT respects Lorentz, it should also respect Poincare, right? But wait, in the Standard Model, Poincare symmetry is already a fundamental symmetry, so all physical theories must respect it. So if SMEFT is built using the SM, then all its operators must respect Poincare symmetry. So 2 is also a correct symmetry. Wait, but the options are separate. Let me check the answer choices again. The options are A (1,2,4), B (3,4), C (1,2), D (1,3,4). So if both 1 and 2 are correct, then the answer would be C. But wait, maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz transformations and spacetime translations. The Standard Model, and hence SMEFT, must respect Poincare symmetry because it's a basic spacetime symmetry. So operators in SMEFT must be Poincare-invariant. So 2 is correct. Therefore, both 1 and 2 must be correct. So the answer would include both 1 and 2. Let's see the options: C is 1,2. But wait, the question is asking which must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. So all the operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz and Poincare.

But wait, do all operators in SMEFT necessarily respect CP and CPT? I think SMEFT operators can break some symmetries, but the question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators. That is, which symmetries are necessarily present in all SMEFT operators.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify. The question is: "Which of the following symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT?" So even if some operators break CP or CPT, but the question is whether the symmetry is respected by all operators. So which of these symmetries are necessarily present in every operator of the SMEFT.

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking which symmetries must all operators respect, meaning that all operators must be symmetric under these transformations. So the symmetries that are not explicitly broken by the SMEFT framework.

Wait, no. The SMEFT framework includes higher-dimensional operators. These operators are constructed with the Standard Model fields and are Lorentz-invariant, gauge-invariant. But they can include various terms, including those that break some symmetries. However, the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So even if some operators break CP or CPT, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators are the ones that are not explicitly broken.

Wait, but the question is phrased as which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So perhaps the correct answer is that all operators must respect Lorentz and Poincare symmetry. Because SMEFT is built using those symmetries. So even if some operators break other symmetries like CP or CPT, the operators themselves must still respect Lorentz and Poincare. For example, an operator that is Lorentz-invariant but CP-violating would still respect Lorentz and Poincare, but not CP. So the symmetries that must be respected by all operators are Lorentz (1) and Poincare (2). So the correct answer would be C (1,2). But wait, the options are A (1,2,4), B (3,4), C (1,2), D (1,3,4).

But wait, another thought: Poincare symmetry is a fundamental symmetry of spacetime. If SMEFT is an effective theory built using the Standard Model, which already includes Poincare symmetry, then all operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare. So 2 is correct. Lorentz is part of Poincare, so 1 is also correct. So the answer would be C.

But wait, the question is about the symmetries that must be respected by all operators. So even if some operators break CP or CPT, those symmetries are not required to be respected by all operators. For example, an operator could have a term that violates CP, but the operator itself must still be Lorentz and Poincare invariant. Therefore, the answer is 1 and 2, which is option C.

Wait, but let me think again. The SMEFT framework is built with operators that are constructed to respect the Standard Model symmetries. Wait, actually, the SMEFT framework is based on the Standard Model symmetry group, which includes Lorentz symmetry, gauge symmetry, and CPT symmetry (since the SM is CPT symmetric). However, the SMEFT operators are constructed with higher-dimensional terms that are Lorentz and gauge invariant, but can break other symmetries like CP. However, the question is asking which symmetries must all operators respect. So even if some operators break CP or CPT, the operators must still respect Lorentz and Poincare. Therefore, the answer is 1 and 2, which is option C.

But wait, the SMEFT framework is built using the Standard Model, which includes Lorentz and Poincare symmetry. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect those. So the answer would be C (1,2). But I need to make sure that I'm not mixing up the symmetries. Let me check each symmetry:

1. Lorentz Symmetry: Yes, all operators are Lorentz invariant because SMEFT is constructed using Lorentz-invariant terms.

2. Poincare Symmetry: Yes, because SMEFT is an effective theory based on the Standard Model, which respects Poincare symmetry. All operators must be Poincare-invariant.

3. CP Symmetry: The SMEFT framework allows operators that break CP. For example, the dipole operators or others that can violate CP. Therefore, not all operators must respect CP symmetry. So 3 is not necessarily correct.

4. CPT Symmetry: The SM respects CPT symmetry, but SMEFT operators can break CPT. For example, operators with different left and right-handed fields might break CPT. Therefore, not all operators must respect CPT. So 4 is not necessarily correct.

Therefore, the answer is 1 and 2, which is option C. So the final answer should be C.
Therefore, the correct answer is $\boxed{C}$.
