Okay, so I need to find the number of paths of length 16 on an 8x8 grid that start at the lower left corner and end at the upper right corner, changing direction exactly four times. Let me start by understanding the problem better.

First, an 8x8 grid would have 9 horizontal lines and 9 vertical lines, right? So moving from one corner to the opposite corner would require 8 moves to the right (east) and 8 moves up (north). Therefore, a path of length 16 makes sense because it's 8 right and 8 up moves in some order. The total number of such paths without any restrictions is the binomial coefficient C(16,8), which is 12870. But we need to find only those paths that change direction exactly four times.

Hmm, what does changing direction exactly four times mean? Let me think. A direction change occurs when the path switches from moving horizontally to vertically or vice versa. So each time the path switches direction, that's a change. For example, starting with a horizontal move, then switching to vertical would be one change, then switching back to horizontal would be two changes, and so on. 

But wait, in the context of a grid path, each straight segment (either horizontal or vertical) contributes to a straight part of the path. Each time the direction changes, the number of segments increases. So if a path changes direction exactly four times, how many segments does it have?

Let me break it down. If a path starts with a horizontal move, then alternates direction each time, the number of segments would be 1 (initial) + 4 changes = 5 segments. Similarly, if it starts with a vertical move, it would also have 5 segments. But wait, the problem says "change direction exactly four times." So does that mean the path alternates direction four times, resulting in five segments? Or is there a different interpretation?

Wait, let's clarify. If a path starts with a horizontal move, then changes direction once, that's two segments. Each subsequent direction change adds one more segment. So if there are four direction changes, the number of segments is 1 + 4 = 5. So regardless of starting direction, four direction changes would result in five segments. Therefore, the path is composed of five straight segments, alternating between horizontal and vertical.

But the starting direction matters. If it starts with horizontal, then the sequence of directions would be horizontal, vertical, horizontal, vertical, horizontal. If it starts with vertical, it would be vertical, horizontal, vertical, horizontal, vertical. Either way, five segments. So both possibilities need to be considered.

Therefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of paths that consist of five alternating horizontal and vertical segments, starting either with horizontal or vertical, and covering exactly 8 horizontal and 8 vertical moves. Wait, but each segment is a consecutive run of horizontal or vertical moves. So each horizontal segment must cover some number of horizontal steps, and each vertical segment must cover some number of vertical steps, such that the total horizontal steps add up to 8 and the total vertical steps add up to 8.

So, for example, if the path starts with a horizontal segment, then the number of horizontal segments is 3 (since starting with horizontal, then alternating four times gives 1+4=5 segments, with horizontal segments at positions 1, 3, 5). Wait, no. Wait, if there are five segments, starting with horizontal, then the horizontal segments are 1st, 3rd, 5th. The vertical segments are 2nd and 4th. So the number of horizontal segments is 3, and vertical segments is 2. Wait, that can't be. Wait, if you start with horizontal, then the directions alternate. So the sequence of directions would be H, V, H, V, H. So three horizontal segments and two vertical segments. Similarly, starting with vertical would be V, H, V, H, V. So three vertical segments and two horizontal segments.

Therefore, in the case of four direction changes, the path will have three segments of one direction and two of the other. So if starting with horizontal, three horizontal segments and two vertical segments. The sum of the horizontal segments must be 8, and the sum of the vertical segments must be 8.

Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the number of compositions of 8 into three parts for horizontal moves, and two parts for vertical moves, multiplied by the number of compositions of 8 into two parts for vertical moves, and three parts for horizontal moves, depending on the starting direction.

Wait, let me formalize that. Let's denote:

Case 1: Path starts with horizontal. Then, there are three horizontal segments and two vertical segments. Each horizontal segment must have at least one step, and each vertical segment must have at least one step. So the number of ways to compose 8 horizontal steps into 3 segments is C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2) = 21. Similarly, the number of ways to compose 8 vertical steps into 2 segments is C(8-1,2-1) = C(7,1) = 7. Therefore, the total number of paths starting with horizontal is 21 * 7 = 147.

Case 2: Path starts with vertical. Then, there are three vertical segments and two horizontal segments. The number of ways to compose 8 vertical steps into 3 segments is C(7,2) = 21. The number of ways to compose 8 horizontal steps into 2 segments is C(7,1) = 7. Therefore, the total number of paths starting with vertical is 21 * 7 = 147.

Therefore, the total number of paths with exactly four direction changes is 147 + 147 = 294. Wait, but hold on. Let me verify this.

Wait, in each case, the starting direction is fixed, and the number of segments is determined. For starting with horizontal, three horizontal segments and two vertical. Each horizontal segment must be at least 1, so the number of compositions is C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2) = 21. Similarly, vertical segments: C(8-1,2-1) = C(7,1)=7. So 21*7=147. Similarly for starting with vertical. So total 294. But that seems low. Let me check with a smaller grid.

Suppose we have a 2x2 grid. So from (0,0) to (2,2). Paths of length 4. Number of direction changes exactly two times. Let's compute according to the same method.

Case 1: Starting with horizontal. Then segments: 3 horizontal, 1 vertical. Wait, no. Wait, direction changes. Wait, for four moves, how many direction changes? Wait, in a 2x2 grid, the number of direction changes would be... Wait, maybe my approach is wrong.

Alternatively, let's take a 2x2 grid. Paths from (0,0) to (2,2). Each path has 2 horizontal and 2 vertical moves. The number of direction changes is the number of times the path switches direction. For example, a path that goes right, right, up, up has zero direction changes. A path that goes right, up, right, up has two direction changes. A path that goes right, up, up, right has two direction changes as well.

Wait, so in a 2x2 grid, the number of direction changes can be 0, 2, or 3? Wait, no. Wait, let's enumerate all possible paths.

There are C(4,2)=6 paths. Let's list them:

1. R, R, U, U: two segments (RR and UU), so zero direction changes.

2. R, U, R, U: direction changes three times (R->U, U->R, R->U). Wait, actually, direction changes occur between moves. So each time the direction changes, that's a change. So in R, U, R, U, the directions are R, U, R, U. The changes occur after the first R, then after the first U, then after the first R. So three direction changes.

3. R, U, U, R: direction changes after R, then after U, then after U. So two direction changes.

4. U, R, R, U: similar to case 3, direction changes after U, then after R, then after R. Two direction changes.

5. U, R, U, R: direction changes after U, R, U. Three direction changes.

6. U, U, R, R: similar to case 1, zero direction changes.

So in total, there are two paths with zero direction changes, two paths with two direction changes, and two paths with three direction changes. Wait, but according to the formula I used earlier, if we consider direction changes exactly two times, then starting with horizontal, three horizontal segments and one vertical segment? Wait, but in a 2x2 grid, starting with horizontal, the number of segments would be 3 horizontal and 1 vertical? But that would require 3+1=4 moves, which is correct. But the number of compositions would be C(2-1,3-1)=C(1,2)=0, which doesn't make sense. So my earlier approach is flawed.

Wait, perhaps the formula isn't applicable here because when the number of segments exceeds the number of steps. For example, in the 2x2 grid, starting with horizontal, we need to split 2 horizontal steps into 3 segments, which is impossible because each segment must have at least one step. Therefore, the number of compositions would be zero. Similarly for vertical. So in that case, there would be zero paths starting with horizontal or vertical that have four segments (three horizontal, one vertical or vice versa). But in reality, there are paths with three direction changes. So maybe my initial approach is incorrect.

Hmm, so perhaps the formula works when the number of segments is less than or equal to the number of steps. Wait, in the 2x2 grid, if we have three horizontal segments and one vertical segment, each horizontal segment has at least one step. So 3 horizontal segments would require 3 steps, but we only have 2 horizontal steps. So that's impossible. Therefore, the formula gives zero, but in reality, there are paths with three direction changes, which are four segments (alternating directions), but in that case, the number of horizontal and vertical segments would be two each. Wait, no. Wait, in the 2x2 grid, a path with three direction changes would have four segments: H, V, H, V. So two horizontal segments and two vertical segments. So the number of horizontal segments is two, vertical segments is two. Therefore, the number of compositions would be C(2-1,2-1)=C(1,1)=1 for horizontal, and same for vertical. So 1*1=1. But in the 2x2 grid, there are two such paths: R, U, R, U and U, R, U, R. Wait, but according to the formula, it's 1*1=1. Hmm, discrepancy here.

So perhaps my initial formula is not correct. Maybe I need to adjust the way I count the compositions. Let me think again.

When we have a path starting with horizontal direction, and after four direction changes, the number of segments is five. Wait, but in the 2x2 grid, if the path has three direction changes, the number of segments is four. So in general, the number of segments is direction changes + 1. Therefore, for four direction changes, five segments. Wait, but in the 2x2 grid, even with three direction changes, there are four segments. So in that case, direction changes + 1 = segments. Therefore, four direction changes would result in five segments.

But in the 2x2 grid, that would require five segments, but we only have four moves. Wait, no. Wait, in the 2x2 grid, each path has four moves, so five segments would require five moves, which is impossible. Therefore, my initial assumption is wrong. Therefore, the number of direction changes is equal to the number of segments minus one. Therefore, four direction changes would correspond to five segments, but in a 2x2 grid, we can't have five segments with four moves. Therefore, the maximum number of direction changes in a 2x2 grid is three, which corresponds to four segments.

Therefore, in the original problem, for an 8x8 grid, a path of 16 moves with four direction changes would have five segments. So each segment is a run of consecutive moves in the same direction. Each segment must have at least one move. Therefore, the problem reduces to splitting 8 horizontal moves into three segments (if starting with horizontal) and 8 vertical moves into two segments, or vice versa.

But in the 2x2 grid, if we have four direction changes, that would require five segments, which is impossible with four moves. Therefore, the formula must be adjusted. Therefore, perhaps the formula is correct only when the number of segments does not exceed the number of steps. So in the original problem, starting with horizontal, we need three horizontal segments and two vertical segments. Each horizontal segment must have at least one step, so 8 horizontal steps into three segments is equivalent to placing two dividers among the 7 gaps between the 8 steps, which is C(7,2)=21. Similarly, two vertical segments for vertical steps is C(7,1)=7. So 21*7=147. Then starting with vertical is 21*7=147. So total 294. But in the 2x2 grid, if we tried to apply the same formula, starting with horizontal, we would have C(2-1,3-1)=C(1,2)=0 for horizontal segments, which is impossible. Similarly, starting with vertical, C(1,2)=0. Therefore, in the 2x2 grid, the formula would give zero, but in reality, there are paths with three direction changes, which correspond to four segments. Therefore, my formula is not applicable for cases where the number of segments exceeds the number of steps.

Therefore, perhaps the formula is only applicable when the number of segments is less than or equal to the number of steps for each direction. So in the original problem, starting with horizontal, we have three horizontal segments and two vertical segments. Since three <=8 and two <=8, it's okay. But in the 2x2 grid, starting with horizontal, three horizontal segments would require three steps, but we only have two. Therefore, in such cases, the formula gives zero, but the actual number is non-zero. Therefore, maybe my approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is correct, and the discrepancy in the 2x2 grid is due to a different interpretation. Let's check.

In the 2x2 grid, if we consider a path with three direction changes, which would be four segments: H, V, H, V. So two horizontal segments and two vertical segments. Therefore, the number of ways to split 2 horizontal steps into 2 segments is C(2-1,2-1)=C(1,1)=1. Similarly, for vertical steps. Therefore, total paths would be 1*1=1. But in reality, there are two such paths: R, U, R, U and U, R, U, R. So why the discrepancy?

Ah, maybe because the order of the segments matters. Wait, no. Wait, in the case of starting with horizontal, the segments would be H1, V1, H2, V2. The number of ways to split horizontal steps into two segments is C(2-1,2-1)=1 (either 1+1). Similarly, vertical steps into two segments is 1. So total 1*1=1. But in reality, there are two paths: one starts with H1=1, V1=1, H2=1, V2=1. But the other path is V1=1, H1=1, V2=1, H2=1. Wait, no, that's the same path. Wait, no. Wait, no, the two paths are different. Wait, no, the path R, U, R, U is H1=2, V1=1, H2=0? Wait, no, each segment must have at least one step. So in the 2x2 grid, starting with horizontal, the first horizontal segment must be at least 1, then vertical at least 1, etc. So the only possible split is H1=1, V1=1, H2=1, V2=1, which is the path R, U, R, U. Similarly, starting with vertical, V1=1, H1=1, V2=1, H2=1, which is U, R, U, R. Therefore, there are two such paths, each corresponding to starting with horizontal or vertical. Therefore, according to the formula, starting with horizontal gives 1 path, starting with vertical gives 1 path, total 2. Which matches reality. Therefore, in the 2x2 grid, the formula works.

Wait, but according to the formula, starting with horizontal, the number of horizontal segments is three? Wait, no. Wait, the number of segments is direction changes + 1. So four direction changes would be five segments. But in the 2x2 grid, with three direction changes, that's four segments. So if we apply the formula for four direction changes (five segments), which is impossible, the formula gives zero. But in reality, three direction changes (four segments) give two paths. So perhaps the formula is not directly applicable. Therefore, maybe my original approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the formula is applicable when the number of segments does not exceed the number of steps. So for the original problem, starting with horizontal, three horizontal segments and two vertical segments. Since 3 <=8 and 2<=8, it's okay. But in the 2x2 grid, starting with horizontal, three horizontal segments would require three steps, but we have only two. Therefore, the formula is not applicable. Therefore, maybe the formula is correct only when the number of segments is possible.

Therefore, in the original problem, since 3 <=8 and 2<=8, the formula gives 21*7=147 for each starting direction, total 294. But in the 2x2 grid, for three direction changes (four segments), the formula would require two horizontal segments and two vertical segments. Since 2<=2 and 2<=2, the formula would give C(2-1,2-1)=1 for horizontal and vertical, so 1*1=1, but in reality, there are two paths. Therefore, the formula is undercounting by a factor of 2. So perhaps the formula needs to be adjusted.

Alternatively, maybe in the 2x2 grid, the formula counts each path twice, once for starting with horizontal and once for vertical. But in reality, each path has a unique starting direction. So perhaps the formula is correct. Wait, in the 2x2 grid, starting with horizontal, the number of horizontal segments is two, and vertical segments is two. So the formula would be C(2-1,2-1)=1 for horizontal and same for vertical. So 1*1=1. But there are two paths: starting with horizontal and starting with vertical. Therefore, perhaps the formula is missing a factor of 2.

Alternatively, maybe in the original problem, the formula counts each path once, but in the 2x2 grid, each path is counted once in one of the two cases. Therefore, the formula would give 147*2=294, which is correct. But in the 2x2 grid, the formula gives 1*2=2, which matches reality. Therefore, the formula is correct.

Therefore, going back to the original problem, the answer would be 294. But let me verify once more.

Each path with four direction changes must have five segments: three in one direction and two in the other. Starting with horizontal or vertical. For each starting direction, the number of ways is C(8-1,3-1)*C(8-1,2-1) = C(7,2)*C(7,1) = 21*7=147. Therefore, total 147+147=294. So the answer is 294.

But let me check with another example. Suppose we have a 3x3 grid (from (0,0) to (3,3)). Paths of length 6. Number of direction changes exactly two times. Then, according to the formula, starting with horizontal: three horizontal segments and one vertical segment. But three horizontal segments require three steps, but we have three horizontal steps in total. So the number of ways to split 3 horizontal steps into three segments is C(3-1,3-1)=C(2,2)=1. The vertical steps into one segment is C(3-1,1-1)=C(2,0)=1. So total 1*1=1. Starting with vertical: three vertical segments and one horizontal segment. Similarly, 1*1=1. Total 2. But let's enumerate the paths. A path with two direction changes would have three segments. Starting with horizontal: H, V, H. But in a 3x3 grid, each segment must have at least one step. So horizontal segments: 1,1,1. Vertical segment: 3. But vertical segment can't be 3 because total vertical steps are 3. So the path would be H, V, H. But that would be R, U, R, U, R. Wait, but that's five moves, but we need six moves. Wait, no. Wait, in a 3x3 grid, the path from (0,0) to (3,3) requires 3 right and 3 up moves, total 6. A path with two direction changes (three segments) would be H, V, H. The number of horizontal steps is 3, split into three segments: 1,1,1. The vertical steps are 3, split into one segment: 3. Therefore, the path is R, UUU, R. But wait, that's a total of 1+3+1=5 moves, but we need 6. Therefore, this is impossible. Therefore, there are no such paths.

Alternatively, maybe the direction changes are counted differently. Wait, in the 3x3 grid, a path with two direction changes would have three segments. For example, starting with horizontal: H, V, H. The horizontal segments sum to 3, vertical segments sum to 3. But each horizontal segment must be at least 1, so three horizontal segments: 1+1+1=3. Vertical segments: one segment of 3. Therefore, the path is R, UUU, R. But that's 1+3+1=5 moves. Wait, but we need 6 moves. Therefore, this is impossible. Therefore, there are no such paths. Therefore, the formula gives 1*1 + 1*1=2, but in reality, there are zero paths. Therefore, the formula is overcounting. Therefore, my approach is flawed.

Wait, so maybe the formula is incorrect. Therefore, perhaps the way I'm counting the segments is wrong. Because in the 3x3 grid, the formula suggests there are two paths, but in reality, there are none. Therefore, my initial approach is wrong.

Therefore, perhaps I need a different approach. Let me think again.

The problem is to count the number of paths from (0,0) to (8,8) on an 8x8 grid (i.e., a 9x9 grid of points) that change direction exactly four times. Each path consists of 16 moves: 8 right and 8 up. Each direction change is when the path switches from moving right to up or up to right.

An alternative way to model this is to consider the sequence of directions. Each path is a sequence of 16 moves, each either R or U, with exactly 8 R's and 8 U's. The number of direction changes is the number of times the direction switches from R to U or U to R. For example, a path like R, R, U, U, R, U, U, R, ..., would have direction changes each time the direction switches.

The key is to count the number of such sequences with exactly four direction changes. Each direction change corresponds to a switch between R and U. Therefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of sequences of 16 moves (8 R and 8 U) with exactly four switches.

This is similar to arranging the R's and U's with exactly four transitions between R and U. The number of such sequences can be calculated using the concept of "runs." A run is a consecutive sequence of the same character. For example, "RRRUUURR" has three runs: RRR, UUU, RR.

In our case, the number of runs is equal to the number of direction changes plus one. So if there are four direction changes, the number of runs is five. Therefore, the path alternates between R and U five times. Therefore, the sequence of directions must have five runs. Each run is a consecutive sequence of R's or U's.

Therefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of sequences with exactly five runs, consisting of 8 R's and 8 U's. The number of such sequences can be calculated using combinatorics.

First, we need to determine the number of ways to partition the 8 R's into a certain number of runs and the 8 U's into the remaining number of runs, such that the total number of runs is five. Since the runs alternate between R and U, the number of R runs and U runs can differ by at most one.

Since there are five runs, which is odd, the number of R runs and U runs must differ by one. Specifically, if the sequence starts with R, the number of R runs is three and U runs is two. If it starts with U, the number of U runs is three and R runs is two.

Therefore, we have two cases:

Case 1: Starting with R. Then, there are three runs of R and two runs of U. The total number of R runs is three, which must sum to 8. The number of ways to partition 8 R's into three runs (each at least one) is C(8-1,3-1)=C(7,2)=21. Similarly, the total number of U runs is two, which must sum to 8. The number of ways to partition 8 U's into two runs (each at least one) is C(8-1,2-1)=C(7,1)=7. Therefore, the total number of sequences starting with R is 21*7=147.

Case 2: Starting with U. Similarly, there are three runs of U and two runs of R. The number of ways to partition 8 U's into three runs is C(7,2)=21. The number of ways to partition 8 R's into two runs is C(7,1)=7. Therefore, the total number of sequences starting with U is 21*7=147.

Therefore, the total number of sequences is 147 + 147 = 294. Therefore, the answer is 294.

But wait, in the 3x3 grid example, this formula would give 294, but in reality, the correct answer is zero. However, in the 3x3 grid example, the formula gives 2 (147 + 147) but the actual number is zero. Therefore, there must be a mistake here.

Wait, no. Wait, in the 3x3 grid example, the path has 6 moves, with 3 R and 3 U. The number of sequences with exactly four direction changes. But four direction changes would require five runs. Since the total number of moves is six, the number of runs is five. However, the total number of R and U steps is three each. Let's see:

If starting with R, the number of R runs is three and U runs is two. The total R steps: 3 runs, each at least 1, sum to 3. The number of ways is C(3-1,3-1)=C(2,2)=1. The U steps: 2 runs, sum to 3. The number of ways is C(3-1,2-1)=C(2,1)=2. Therefore, total sequences starting with R: 1*2=2. Similarly, starting with U: 2*1=2. Total sequences: 4. But in reality, in the 3x3 grid, there are no such paths because the number of steps is three each, and the runs would require at least three steps for R and two for U, but total steps would be 3+2=5, which is less than six. Wait, no. Wait, in the 3x3 grid, each run is a consecutive sequence. For example, starting with R, three runs: R1, R2, R3. Each R run has at least one step. Similarly, two U runs. So total R steps: R1 + R2 + R3 = 3. Total U steps: U1 + U2 = 3. Therefore, the total steps are 3 + 3 = 6, which is correct. Therefore, the number of such sequences is 1*2=2 starting with R, and 2*1=2 starting with U, total 4. But when I tried to enumerate earlier, I thought there were none. Let me check.

In the 3x3 grid, starting with R, the runs would be R1, U1, R2, U2, R3. The R1 + R2 + R3 =3, U1 + U2=3. The number of ways to split R's into three runs is C(3-1,3-1)=1. The number of ways to split U's into two runs is C(3-1,2-1)=2. So the sequences are:

R1=1, R2=1, R3=1; U1=1, U2=2

R1=1, R2=1, R3=1; U1=2, U2=1

Similarly for the other splits. Therefore, the sequences would be:

R, U, R, U, R, UU

R, U, R, UU, R, U

Similarly starting with U:

U, R, U, R, U, RR

U, R, UU, R, U, R

But wait, these are different paths. Each path has 6 moves. For example, R, U, R, U, R, UU is R, U, R, U, R, UU. This path has direction changes at each move from R to U, U to R, R to U, U to R, R to U. So direction changes at moves 2,4,5,6. Wait, no. Wait, direction changes occur between moves. So between move 1 and 2: R to U (change). Between 2 and 3: U to R (change). Between 3 and 4: R to U (change). Between 4 and 5: U to R (change). Between 5 and 6: R to U (change). So total five direction changes. But the problem requires exactly four direction changes. Therefore, this is a problem. Therefore, my initial formula overcounts because it allows for five direction changes when the problem requires four.

Wait, this is a critical point. The formula counts the number of sequences with exactly five runs, which correspond to four direction changes. But in the 3x3 grid example, according to the formula, there are 4 such sequences, but each has five direction changes. Therefore, the formula is correct, but the problem requires exactly four direction changes. Therefore, the formula counts sequences with five direction changes, which is different.

Therefore, there is a discrepancy here. Wait, in the original problem, the number of direction changes is exactly four, which corresponds to five runs. But in the 3x3 grid, the formula gives four sequences, but each has five direction changes. Therefore, the formula is correct for the original problem. But in the 3x3 grid, the answer is zero, but according to the formula, it's 4. Therefore, the formula is not applicable here.

Wait, but in the original problem, the path length is 16 moves, which is correct. The 3x3 grid path is 6 moves, but in the formula, for four direction changes, the number of runs is five. Therefore, the formula is correct, but in the 3x3 grid, the number of such paths is four, but they have five direction changes. Therefore, the formula is correct, but the problem here is in the 3x3 grid, the formula is overcounting. Wait, no. Wait, in the 3x3 grid, the formula counts four paths with five direction changes, but the problem requires four direction changes. Therefore, there's a mismatch.

Therefore, perhaps the formula is not directly applicable. Therefore, perhaps my initial approach is incorrect, and I need a different method.

Alternatively, maybe in the original problem, the formula is correct because the 3x3 grid example is different. Let me check again.

Wait, in the 3x3 grid, if we need four direction changes (five runs), then according to the formula, there are four paths. However, each such path has five direction changes. Therefore, the formula counts the number of paths with five direction changes, but the problem requires four. Therefore, the formula is not applicable. Therefore, the initial approach is flawed.

Therefore, perhaps another approach is needed.

Alternative approach: Let's model the problem as a sequence of runs. Each run is a consecutive sequence of R's or U's. The number of runs is equal to the number of direction changes plus one. Therefore, for four direction changes, the number of runs is five. Therefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of sequences of R's and U's with exactly five runs, consisting of 8 R's and 8 U's.

Each run must be at least one step. The number of ways to partition 8 R's into k runs is C(7, k-1). Similarly for U's. The number of runs of R's and U's must satisfy that the total number of runs is five. Since the sequence starts with either R or U, the number of runs of R's and U's can be:

If starting with R: number of R runs = 3, U runs = 2

If starting with U: number of R runs = 2, U runs = 3

Therefore, the total number of sequences is:

Starting with R: C(7,2)*C(7,1) = 21*7=147

Starting with U: C(7,1)*C(7,2)=7*21=147

Total: 147+147=294

Therefore, according to this approach, the answer is 294. But in the 3x3 grid example, the formula gives four paths with five direction changes, but the problem requires four direction changes. Therefore, the formula is not directly applicable. Therefore, perhaps the formula is correct for the original problem, but the 3x3 grid example is a different case.

Wait, in the 3x3 grid, if we need four direction changes, the number of runs would be five. Therefore, the formula would give four paths (as in the 3x3 grid example), but each has five direction changes. Therefore, there is a mismatch between the problem's requirement and the formula.

Therefore, the formula counts sequences with five runs (four direction changes) for the original problem, which is correct. But in the 3x3 grid example, the formula counts sequences with five runs (four direction changes), but the problem requires four direction changes. Wait, but in the 3x3 grid example, the problem is to count paths with four direction changes, which would correspond to five runs. But in reality, there are four such paths, which is correct. Therefore, the formula is correct.

Wait, but in the 3x3 grid, the four paths each have five runs, which correspond to four direction changes. Wait, no. Wait, number of direction changes is number of runs minus one. So five runs correspond to four direction changes. Therefore, the formula is correct. Therefore, in the 3x3 grid example, starting with R, there are two runs of R and three runs of U. Wait, no. Wait, starting with R, number of R runs is three and U runs is two. Therefore, total runs five. Therefore, direction changes four. Therefore, the four paths correspond to four direction changes. Therefore, the formula is correct. Therefore, the answer is 294.

Therefore, returning to the original problem, the number of paths is 294. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{294}$.
