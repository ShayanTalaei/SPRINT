Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking for the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\] where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \). Hmm, complex numbers can sometimes be tricky, but maybe there's a way to simplify this using polar form or some other method.

First, I remember that when dealing with complex numbers and their magnitudes, expressing \( z \) in polar form might be helpful. Since \( |z| = 4 \), we can write \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \) where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). That way, both \( z \) and \( \frac{1}{z} \) can be represented in terms of \( \theta \), which might make the expression easier to handle.

Let me write that down. If \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), then \( \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \). So substituting these into the original expression:

\[
(75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4} \cdot e^{-i\theta}
\]

Simplifying the coefficients:

First term: \( 4(75 + 117i) = 300 + 468i \)

Second term: \( \frac{96 + 144i}{4} = 24 + 36i \)

So the expression becomes:

\[
(300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

Now, the goal is to find the real part of this expression and maximize it. Let's recall that for a complex number \( (a + bi)e^{i\phi} \), the real part is \( a\cos\phi - b\sin\phi \). Similarly, the real part of \( (c + di)e^{-i\phi} \) is \( c\cos\phi + d\sin\phi \). Let me confirm that:

Yes, \( e^{i\phi} = \cos\phi + i\sin\phi \), so multiplying by \( a + bi \):

\( (a + bi)(\cos\phi + i\sin\phi) = a\cos\phi - b\sin\phi + i(a\sin\phi + b\cos\phi) \). So the real part is indeed \( a\cos\phi - b\sin\phi \).

Similarly, \( e^{-i\phi} = \cos\phi - i\sin\phi \), so multiplying by \( c + di \):

\( (c + di)(\cos\phi - i\sin\phi) = c\cos\phi + d\sin\phi + i(-c\sin\phi + d\cos\phi) \). So the real part is \( c\cos\phi + d\sin\phi \).

Therefore, applying this to our expression:

Real part of the first term: \( 300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta \)

Real part of the second term: \( 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta \)

Adding them together, the total real part is:

\[
(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta) + (24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) = (300 + 24)\cos\theta + (-468 + 36)\sin\theta = 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta
\]

So now, the problem reduces to maximizing the expression \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \) over \( \theta \). That's a standard problem in trigonometry where you need to find the maximum of a linear combination of sine and cosine. The maximum value of \( A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta \) is \( \sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \). Wait, but in our case, it's \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \). So the maximum value would be \( \sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} \).

Calculating that:

First, compute \( 324^2 \):

\( 324 \times 324 \). Let's compute 300^2 = 90,000, 24^2 = 576, and 2*300*24 = 14,400. So (300 + 24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 + 24^2 = 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 104,976.

Similarly, 432^2: 400^2 = 160,000, 32^2 = 1,024, 2*400*32 = 25,600. So (400 + 32)^2 = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 186,624.

Therefore, \( \sqrt{104,976 + 186,624} = \sqrt{291,600} \). Hmm, what's the square root of 291,600? Let me check:

\( 540^2 = 291,600 \). Because 500^2 = 250,000, 40^2 = 1,600, and 2*500*40 = 40,000. So 500 + 40 squared is 250,000 + 40,000 + 1,600 = 291,600. So yes, sqrt(291,600) = 540.

Therefore, the maximum real part is 540. But wait, let me verify if this approach is correct. Because we transformed the original expression into a single sinusoidal function, which should give the maximum value as the amplitude. But let me check if there are any constraints or if I missed something in the substitution.

Wait, let me recap:

Original expression: \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\]

We set \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), so \( \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \). Then, substituting into the expression:

First term: \( (75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} = 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} = (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} \)

Second term: \( \frac{96 + 144i}{4}e^{-i\theta} = (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \)

Then, adding these two terms, we get:

\( (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \)

Then, taking real parts:

Real part of first term: \( 300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta \)

Real part of second term: \( 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta \)

Total real part: \( (300 + 24)\cos\theta + (-468 + 36)\sin\theta = 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \)

So that's correct. Then, the maximum of \( A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta \) is indeed \( \sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \). Therefore, plugging in A = 324, B = -432, we get \( \sqrt{324^2 + 432^2} = \sqrt{(324)^2 + (432)^2} \). Wait, earlier I computed \( 324^2 + (-432)^2 = 324^2 + 432^2 \), which is 104,976 + 186,624 = 291,600. So sqrt(291,600) = 540. So maximum real part is 540. Therefore, the answer should be 540.

But wait, I want to make sure there isn't a mistake here. Let me verify with another approach.

Alternatively, maybe using calculus. Let me consider \( f(\theta) = 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \). To find its maximum, take the derivative and set it to zero.

\( f'(\theta) = -324\sin\theta - 432\cos\theta \)

Set to zero:

\( -324\sin\theta - 432\cos\theta = 0 \)

Divide both sides by -432:

\( (324/432)\sin\theta + \cos\theta = 0 \)

Simplify 324/432: divide numerator and denominator by 108: 3/4. So:

\( (3/4)\sin\theta + \cos\theta = 0 \)

Multiply both sides by 4:

\( 3\sin\theta + 4\cos\theta = 0 \)

So \( 3\sin\theta = -4\cos\theta \)

Divide both sides by cosθ (assuming cosθ ≠ 0):

\( 3\tan\theta = -4 \)

So \( \tan\theta = -4/3 \). Therefore, θ is in the second or fourth quadrant. Let's take θ = arctan(-4/3). Let's compute sinθ and cosθ.

If θ = arctan(-4/3), then we can imagine a right triangle where the opposite side is -4 and adjacent is 3, but since tangent is negative, θ is in the fourth quadrant. So cosθ = 3/5, sinθ = -4/5. But wait, in the fourth quadrant, cosθ is positive, sinθ is negative.

Alternatively, θ could be in the second quadrant, where cosθ is negative and sinθ is positive. Let me check.

If θ is in the second quadrant, then tanθ = -4/3, so opposite side is 4, adjacent is -3. Then hypotenuse is 5. Therefore, sinθ = 4/5, cosθ = -3/5.

So depending on the quadrant, sinθ and cosθ can be positive or negative. Let's check both possibilities.

First, suppose θ is in the fourth quadrant: cosθ = 3/5, sinθ = -4/5.

Plugging into f(θ):

324*(3/5) - 432*(-4/5) = (972/5) + (1728/5) = (972 + 1728)/5 = 2700/5 = 540.

Second, θ in second quadrant: cosθ = -3/5, sinθ = 4/5.

Plugging into f(θ):

324*(-3/5) - 432*(4/5) = (-972/5) - (1728/5) = (-972 -1728)/5 = (-2700)/5 = -540.

Therefore, the maximum value is 540, and the minimum is -540. So yes, that's consistent with the previous result. Therefore, the maximum real part is indeed 540.

Wait, but just to be thorough, let me check if there's another approach. For example, using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or other methods. Let's see.

Alternatively, since \( z \) is on the circle of radius 4, we can represent the expression as a function on the circle and try to find its maximum. But I think the approach we took with expressing \( z \) in polar form and then reducing it to a single sinusoidal function is the most straightforward.

Another way: Let me consider the original expression:

\[
(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}
\]

Let me denote \( z = x + yi \) where \( x \) and \( y \) are real numbers, and \( x^2 + y^2 = 16 \). Then, substitute into the expression and compute the real part. But this might get complicated, but let's try.

First, compute \( (75 + 117i)(x + yi) \):

Multiply out:

75x + 75yi + 117i x + 117i^2 y

= 75x + 75yi + 117xi - 117y

Grouping real and imaginary parts:

Real: 75x - 117y

Imaginary: 75y + 117x

So the first term is \( (75x - 117y) + (75y + 117x)i \)

Second term: \( \frac{96 + 144i}{x + yi} \). To compute this, multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate:

\( \frac{(96 + 144i)(x - yi)}{x^2 + y^2} \)

Since \( x^2 + y^2 = 16 \), denominator is 16.

Compute numerator:

96x - 96yi + 144i x - 144i^2 y

= 96x - 96yi + 144xi + 144y

Grouping real and imaginary parts:

Real: 96x + 144y

Imaginary: (-96y + 144x)i

Therefore, the second term is:

\( \frac{96x + 144y}{16} + \frac{-96y + 144x}{16}i \)

Simplify:

Real: 6x + 9y

Imaginary: (-6y + 9x)i

So the second term is \( (6x + 9y) + (9x - 6y)i \)

Now, adding the first term and the second term:

First term: \( (75x - 117y) + (75y + 117x)i \)

Second term: \( (6x + 9y) + (9x - 6y)i \)

Adding real parts: \( 75x - 117y + 6x + 9y = (75x + 6x) + (-117y + 9y) = 81x - 108y \)

Adding imaginary parts: \( 75y + 117x + 9x - 6y = (117x + 9x) + (75y - 6y) = 126x + 69y \)

Therefore, the total expression is \( (81x - 108y) + (126x + 69y)i \)

But we are interested in the real part, which is \( 81x - 108y \). So we need to maximize \( 81x - 108y \) subject to \( x^2 + y^2 = 16 \).

This is another standard optimization problem. The maximum of \( 81x - 108y \) on the circle \( x^2 + y^2 = 16 \) is the amplitude of the vector (81, -108) times the radius. Wait, the maximum value is \( \sqrt{81^2 + (-108)^2} \times \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \). Wait, no, that's not quite right.

Wait, the expression \( 81x - 108y \) can be written as the dot product of the vector (x, y) with (81, -108). The maximum value of this dot product over all (x, y) with \( x^2 + y^2 = 16 \) is the magnitude of the vector (81, -108) times the magnitude of the vector (x, y), but since (x, y) is a unit vector scaled by 4 (since |z| = 4), actually, the maximum value is \( \sqrt{81^2 + (-108)^2} \times 4 \).

Wait, no, let's think carefully. The maximum of \( a x + b y \) subject to \( x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \) is \( r \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \). Wait, is that correct?

Wait, the maximum of \( a x + b y \) over the circle of radius r is indeed \( r \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \). Wait, but actually, the maximum of \( a x + b y \) is \( \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \times \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \) by Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. Since \( x^2 + y^2 = 16 \), then the maximum is \( \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \times 4 \). Wait, but actually, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality says \( |a x + b y| \leq \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \). Therefore, the maximum value is \( \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \times \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \times 4 \).

But in our case, the expression is \( 81x - 108y \), so \( a = 81 \), \( b = -108 \). Therefore, the maximum is \( \sqrt{81^2 + (-108)^2} \times 4 \). Let's compute that.

First, compute \( 81^2 \): 81*81. 80^2=6400, 2*80*1 +1= 160 +1=161, so 6400 + 161= 6561.

Similarly, 108^2: 100^2=10,000, 2*100*8=1,600, 8^2=64. So 10,000 + 1,600 + 64= 11,664.

Therefore, \( 81^2 + (-108)^2 = 6561 + 11664 = 18225 \). The square root of 18225 is 135. Because 135^2 = (100 + 35)^2 = 100^2 + 2*100*35 + 35^2 = 10,000 + 7,000 + 1,225 = 18,225. So yes, sqrt(18225)=135.

Therefore, the maximum value is 135 * 4 = 540. So that's the same result as before. Therefore, confirming that the maximum real part is indeed 540.

Therefore, through two different methods—using polar form and trigonometric identities, and parametrizing \( z \) as \( x + yi \) and using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality—we arrive at the same maximum value of 540. This gives me confidence that the answer is correct.

I should also check if there are any potential errors in the steps. For example, when converting the original expression into polar form, did I correctly compute the coefficients? Let's verify:

Original expression: \( (75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} \)

Substituting \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \):

First term: \( (75 + 117i) * 4e^{i\theta} = 4*(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} \)

Which is \( (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} \). Correct.

Second term: \( (96 + 144i)/z = (96 + 144i)/(4e^{i\theta}) = (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \). Correct.

Then, real parts:

First term: \( 300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta \)

Second term: \( 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta \)

Total real part: \( 300 + 24 = 324 \) and \( -468 + 36 = -432 \). So \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \). Correct.

Then, amplitude: sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2) = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600) = 540. Correct.

So all steps seem valid. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 540.

**Final Answer**
The largest possible real part is \boxed{540}.
Therefore, the largest possible real part of \[(75+117i)z+\frac{96+144i}{z}\] where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z|=4 \) is \boxed{540}.
