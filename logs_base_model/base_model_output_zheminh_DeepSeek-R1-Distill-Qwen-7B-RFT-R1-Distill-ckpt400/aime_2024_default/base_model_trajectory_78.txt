Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. The question is about finding a point C on segment AB such that C doesn't lie on any other segment from the family F except AB itself. Then, we need to find OC² and express it as a fraction p/q, where p and q are coprime, and finally find p+q. Let's break this down.

First, let me visualize the setup. We have points O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, √3/2). These three points form a triangle OAB. The family F consists of segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So each segment PQ is a line connecting a point on the x-axis to a point on the y-axis, and the length of PQ is 1. The problem states that there's a unique point C on AB (other than A and B) that isn't on any other segment from F. We need to find OC².

Let me start by understanding the family F. Each segment PQ has length 1, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, if P is at (p, 0) and Q is at (0, q), then the distance between P and Q is √(p² + q²) = 1. Therefore, for each segment in F, we have p² + q² = 1. Since we're in the first quadrant, both p and q are positive.

So, the family F consists of all such segments where p and q are positive real numbers satisfying p² + q² = 1. Each such segment connects (p,0) to (0,q).

Now, the segment AB connects point A (1/2, 0) to point B (0, √3/2). Let's confirm the length of AB. The distance between A and B is √[(1/2 - 0)² + (0 - √3/2)²] = √[(1/4) + (3/4)] = √1 = 1. So AB is also a unit segment, which makes sense since F consists of unit segments. Therefore, AB is a member of F.

The problem states that there is a unique point C on AB (other than A and B) that does not lie on any other segment from F. So, C is special in that it's on AB but not on any other PQ segment from F. We need to find such a point C and compute OC².

Let me parametrize segment AB. Since A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, √3/2), we can write the parametric equations for AB as follows:

x = 1/2 - (1/2)t

y = 0 + (√3/2)t

where t ranges from 0 to 1. When t=0, we are at A, and t=1, we are at B. So, any point C on AB can be written as ( (1 - t)/2, (√3/2) t ) for some t in (0,1).

Now, we need to find a point C on AB such that it is not on any other segment PQ from F. Since F consists of all segments PQ where p² + q² =1, with P=(p,0) and Q=(0,q), we need to ensure that there is no other PQ segment (other than AB) that passes through C.

In other words, for the point C we found on AB, there should be no other pairs (p, q) with p² + q² =1 such that the line PQ passes through C. Since AB is already a segment in F, we need to find the unique C on AB that is not on any other such PQ.

So, how can we find such a C? Let's think. For each PQ segment, the line PQ can be parameterized. Let's find the equation of the line PQ. Since it connects (p,0) to (0,q), the slope of PQ is (q - 0)/(0 - p) = -q/p. Therefore, the equation of PQ is y = (-q/p)x + q.

Now, if point C = ( (1 - t)/2, (√3/2) t ) lies on PQ, then substituting into the equation:

(√3/2) t = (-q/p) * ( (1 - t)/2 ) + q

Let me write this equation:

(√3/2) t = (-q/p)( (1 - t)/2 ) + q

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate denominators:

√3 t = (-q/p)(1 - t) + 2q

Let me rearrange terms:

√3 t + (q/p)(1 - t) = 2q

Bring all terms to one side:

√3 t + (q/p)(1 - t) - 2q = 0

Factor q:

√3 t + q( (1/p)(1 - t) - 2 ) = 0

But this seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's another approach.

Alternatively, since point C is on AB, and also on PQ, we can write the equation of PQ and AB and see where they intersect. But since AB is already a segment in F, we need to find a point C on AB that doesn't lie on any other PQ.

But we need to find the point C such that there is no other PQ passing through it. So, for each PQ (other than AB) in F, they might intersect AB at some point. The point C is the one that isn't intersected by any other PQ.

Therefore, to find such a C, we need to find a point on AB that is not an intersection point of any other PQ in F.

Alternatively, perhaps the point C is the point where the envelope of all PQ segments intersects AB. The envelope of the family F is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family. The points where the envelope intersects AB would be the points where only one PQ segment (the tangent one) passes through them. Therefore, these points would be the unique points not intersected by any other PQ segments.

Wait, that might be a useful approach. The envelope of the family of lines PQ would be a curve, and the points where this envelope meets AB would be the points where only one PQ passes through them. Since AB is already a member of F, the envelope might touch AB at point C. So, maybe C is the point where the envelope of F meets AB.

Let me recall that the envelope of a family of curves is found by solving the system of equations given by F(x,y) = 0 and ∂F/∂p = 0 (if the family is parameterized by p). Let me try to apply this here.

First, let's parameterize the family F. Each PQ is a line connecting (p,0) to (0,q), with p² + q² =1. Let me express the equation of the line PQ in terms of p and q. As before, the equation is y = (-q/p)x + q.

Alternatively, we can write the equation as (x/p) + (y/q) = 1. That's another way to write the line PQ. Since p² + q² =1, we can express q in terms of p or vice versa.

But to find the envelope, we need to eliminate the parameter between the equation of the line and the derivative with respect to the parameter. Let's set up the parametrization.

Let me consider the family of lines as F(x, y, p) = (x/p) + (y/q) - 1 = 0, with the constraint p² + q² =1. However, q can be expressed as q = sqrt(1 - p²), since q >0. So, substituting q into the equation:

F(x, y, p) = (x/p) + (y / sqrt(1 - p²)) - 1 = 0

To find the envelope, we need to solve F(x, y, p) = 0 and ∂F/∂p = 0.

Compute ∂F/∂p:

∂F/∂p = (-x/p²) + [ y * (1/2)(1 - p²)^(-3/2) * (2p) ] = (-x/p²) + [ y * p / (1 - p²)^(3/2) ] = 0

So, the system is:

1. x/p + y / sqrt(1 - p²) = 1

2. -x/p² + y p / (1 - p²)^(3/2) = 0

We need to solve these equations for x and y in terms of p, and then eliminate p to find the envelope.

Let me call the first equation (1) and the second equation (2).

From equation (2):

- x/p² + y p / (1 - p²)^(3/2) = 0

=> y p / (1 - p²)^(3/2) = x / p²

=> y = [ x / p² ] * [ (1 - p²)^(3/2) / p ]

=> y = x (1 - p²)^(3/2) / p³

Now, substitute this expression for y into equation (1):

x/p + [ x (1 - p²)^(3/2) / p³ ] / sqrt(1 - p²) = 1

Simplify the second term:

[ x (1 - p²)^(3/2) / p³ ] / (1 - p²)^(1/2) ) = x (1 - p²)^(1) / p³

Therefore, equation (1) becomes:

x/p + x (1 - p²)/p³ = 1

Factor x:

x [ 1/p + (1 - p²)/p³ ] = 1

Combine the terms inside the brackets:

1/p + (1 - p²)/p³ = (p² + 1 - p²)/p³ = 1/p³

Therefore, equation (1) simplifies to:

x * (1/p³) = 1

=> x = p³

Now, substitute x = p³ into the expression for y from equation (2):

y = x (1 - p²)^(3/2) / p³ = p³ * (1 - p²)^(3/2) / p³ = (1 - p²)^(3/2)

Therefore, the envelope is given parametrically by:

x = p³

y = (1 - p²)^(3/2)

But we need to express the envelope in Cartesian coordinates. Let me eliminate p.

Let me denote x = p³ and y = (1 - p²)^(3/2). Let's solve for p from x:

p = x^(1/3)

Substitute into y:

y = (1 - (x^(1/3))²)^(3/2) = (1 - x^(2/3))^(3/2)

Therefore, the envelope is y = [1 - x^(2/3)]^(3/2)

Now, we need to find where this envelope intersects AB. The line AB is from (1/2, 0) to (0, √3/2). Let's find the equation of AB.

The slope of AB is (√3/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (√3/2)/(-1/2) = -√3

So, the equation of AB is y = -√3 x + √3*(1/2) = -√3 x + √3/2

Wait, let me check. When x = 0, y = √3/2; when x = 1/2, y = 0. So yes, the equation is y = -√3 x + √3/2.

So, the envelope is y = [1 - x^(2/3)]^(3/2), and AB is y = -√3 x + √3/2. The intersection points of the envelope and AB are the points where [1 - x^(2/3)]^(3/2) = -√3 x + √3/2.

We need to solve this equation for x. Let's denote t = x^(1/3), so x = t³. Then:

Left side: [1 - t²]^(3/2)

Right side: -√3 t³ + √3/2

So, we have [1 - t²]^(3/2) = -√3 t³ + √3/2

This seems a bit complicated, but maybe we can find a solution by inspection. Let's try t = 1/2.

Left side: [1 - (1/2)²]^(3/2) = [1 - 1/4]^(3/2) = (3/4)^(3/2) = (sqrt(3/4))³ = (sqrt(3)/2)³ = 3√3 / 8 ≈ 0.6495

Right side: -√3*(1/2)^3 + √3/2 = -√3*(1/8) + √3/2 = (-√3/8 + 4√3/8) = 3√3/8 ≈ 0.6495

Wow, that works! So t = 1/2 is a solution. Therefore, x = t³ = (1/2)^3 = 1/8. Then, y = [1 - (1/2)^2]^(3/2) = (3/4)^(3/2) = 3√3 / 8. Alternatively, from AB's equation: y = -√3*(1/8) + √3/2 = (-√3/8 + 4√3/8) = 3√3/8. So, the envelope intersects AB at (1/8, 3√3/8). Therefore, this is the point C.

Wait, but let's confirm. The problem states that there is a unique point C on AB (other than A and B) that does not belong to any segment from F other than AB. So, if the envelope of F intersects AB at point C, then this point C is only on AB and the envelope curve. Since the envelope is tangent to each member of F, at point C, only AB is passing through it. Therefore, this point C is the unique point not lying on any other PQ. Therefore, C is (1/8, 3√3/8). Then, OC² is (1/8)^2 + (3√3/8)^2 = 1/64 + (27/64) = 28/64 = 7/16. Therefore, OC² = 7/16, so p=7, q=16, p+q=23.

But wait, let me verify this. Let's check if there are other solutions to the equation [1 - t²]^(3/2) = -√3 t³ + √3/2. We found t=1/2 is a solution. Let's see if there are other solutions.

Let me consider t=0. Then left side is [1 - 0]^(3/2)=1. Right side is 0 + √3/2 ≈0.866. So 1≠0.866.

t=1: left side [1 -1]^(3/2)=0. Right side -√3*1 + √3/2 = -√3/2 ≈-0.866. So 0≠-0.866.

t=√(3)/2 ≈0.866. Let's see:

Left side: [1 - (3/4)]^(3/2) = (1/4)^(3/2) = (1/2)^3 = 1/8 ≈0.125

Right side: -√3*( (√3)/2 )³ + √3/2 = -√3*(3√3)/8 + √3/2 = - (9/8) + √3/2 ≈ -1.125 + 0.866 ≈-0.259. So 0.125≠-0.259.

So, no solution here.

What about t=1/√2≈0.707:

Left side: [1 - (1/2)]^(3/2)= (1/2)^(3/2)= (sqrt(1/2))³≈0.3535

Right side: -√3*(1/√2)^3 + √3/2 ≈-√3*(1/(2√2)) + √3/2≈-√3/(2.828)+0.866≈-0.612 +0.866≈0.254. Not equal to 0.3535.

So, seems like t=1/2 is the only solution. Therefore, the envelope intersects AB only at t=1/2, which gives x=1/8, y=3√3/8.

Therefore, point C is (1/8, 3√3/8). Then OC² is (1/8)^2 + (3√3/8)^2 = 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16. Therefore, p=7, q=16, so p+q=23.

Wait, but let me confirm once again. Since the envelope is tangent to each member of F, the point of tangency on each PQ is unique. Therefore, the envelope touches each PQ at exactly one point. Therefore, the envelope is a curve that is tangent to all segments PQ. So, the envelope of F is a curve, and the only point where this envelope intersects AB is point C. Therefore, point C is the only point on AB that is not on any other PQ segment. Therefore, OC²=7/16, so the answer is 23.

But just to be thorough, let's think if there could be another point on AB that isn't on any other PQ. Suppose there is a point D on AB different from C that is not on any PQ. Then, the line AD (which is AB) would intersect all other PQs except at D. But since the envelope of F touches each PQ exactly once, and AB is already a member of F, the only point where AB is tangent to the envelope is point C. Therefore, any other point on AB would lie on some other PQ. Hence, C is the unique point. Therefore, the answer is 23.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{23}
Therefore, the value of \( OC^2 \) is \(\boxed{23}\).
