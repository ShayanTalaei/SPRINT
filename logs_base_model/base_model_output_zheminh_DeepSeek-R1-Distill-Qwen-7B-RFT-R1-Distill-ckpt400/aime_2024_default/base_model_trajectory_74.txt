Okay, so I have this problem where there are four points A, B, C, D on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, and they form a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let's break it down step by step.

First, let me recall what a rhombus is. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal in length, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, hold on. Wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular, but in a square, which is a special case of a rhombus, they are. Wait, maybe I need to check that again. Let me think. In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, yes, that's the definition. So in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So that's a key property here.

Given that the diagonals intersect at the origin, and since the rhombus is centered at the origin, the origin must be the midpoint of both diagonals. So points A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and points B and D are endpoints of the other diagonal. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, that means if A is (x, y), then C must be (-x, -y), and similarly, if B is (u, v), then D must be (-u, -v). That makes sense because the midpoint of AC would be ((x + (-x))/2, (y + (-y))/2) = (0,0), same for BD.

So all four points of the rhombus are of the form (x, y), (-x, -y), (u, v), (-u, -v). Now, since these points lie on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, each of them must satisfy this equation. So for point A: x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, and for point B: u²/20 - v²/24 = 1. Same for points C and D, but since they are just negatives, their coordinates will satisfy the same equation.

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So the distance from A to B must equal the distance from B to C, which equals the distance from C to D, and so on. But maybe there's a more straightforward way to use the properties of the rhombus here, especially since we know the diagonals intersect at the origin and are perpendicular.

Wait, since the diagonals are perpendicular, then the product of their slopes is -1. Let me think. The slope of diagonal AC is (v - (-v))/(u - (-u)) = (2v)/(2u) = v/u. Wait, no, wait. Diagonal AC is from (x, y) to (-x, -y), so its slope is (-y - y)/(-x - x) = (-2y)/(-2x) = y/x. Similarly, diagonal BD is from (u, v) to (-u, -v), so its slope is (-v - v)/(-u - u) = (-2v)/(-2u) = v/u. Since the diagonals are perpendicular, their slopes multiply to -1. So (y/x) * (v/u) = -1. Therefore, (y/x)*(v/u) = -1 => yv = -xu. That's an important condition.

Also, since all four points lie on the hyperbola, we have x²/20 - y²/24 = 1 and u²/20 - v²/24 = 1. So maybe we can parametrize the points A and B in some way.

Alternatively, maybe we can parametrize the points on the hyperbola using hyperbolic functions. For hyperbolas, a common parametrization is (a cosh θ, b sinh θ), where a and b are the standard parameters. Let me check: for hyperbola x²/a² - y²/b² = 1, parametrization is (a cosh θ, b sinh θ). So in this case, a² = 20 and b² = 24, so a = 2√5 and b = 2√6. So points A and B can be written as (2√5 cosh θ, 2√6 sinh θ) and (2√5 cosh φ, 2√6 sinh φ), respectively. Then, points C and D would be (-2√5 cosh θ, -2√6 sinh θ) and (-2√5 cosh φ, -2√6 sinh φ).

But since ABCD is a rhombus, the sides must be equal. So the distance from A to B must equal the distance from B to C, and so on. Let's compute AB and BC distances.

Wait, but if it's a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin, perhaps there's a better way. Since the diagonals are AC and BD, and they bisect each other at the origin. The rhombus can be considered as two congruent triangles on either side of the diagonals. The sides of the rhombus are the vectors from the origin to the midpoints of the sides. Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of vectors.

Let me consider the vectors OA, OB, OC, OD. Since OA and OC are opposite vectors (since C is -A), and OB and OD are opposite vectors (since D is -B). The sides of the rhombus are vectors AB, BC, CD, DA. Since it's a rhombus, all these sides have the same length.

So, vector AB is B - A. The length squared of AB is |B - A|². Similarly, the length squared of BC is |C - B|². Since AB = BC, we have |B - A|² = |C - B|². Let's compute these:

|B - A|² = (u - x)² + (v - y)²

|C - B|² = (-x - u)² + (-y - v)² = ( -x - u )² + (-y - v)² = (x + u)² + (y + v)²

Set them equal:

(u - x)² + (v - y)² = (x + u)² + (y + v)²

Expanding both sides:

Left side: u² - 2ux + x² + v² - 2vy + y²

Right side: x² + 2ux + u² + y² + 2vy + v²

Set left = right:

u² - 2ux + x² + v² - 2vy + y² = x² + 2ux + u² + y² + 2vy + v²

Simplify both sides by subtracting x², y², u², v²:

-2ux - 2vy = 2ux + 2vy

Bring all terms to left:

-2ux - 2vy - 2ux - 2vy = 0 => -4ux -4vy = 0 => 4ux + 4vy = 0 => ux + vy = 0

Which is the same condition as before: yv = -xu. So that's consistent. So that's the condition for the rhombus.

Therefore, the condition that the diagonals are perpendicular is equivalent to ux + vy = 0.

So, since we have points A(x, y) and B(u, v), lying on the hyperbola, with ux + vy = 0. Also, the hyperbola equations:

x²/20 - y²/24 = 1

u²/20 - v²/24 = 1

We need to find BD². BD is the distance between points B(u, v) and D(-u, -v). So BD² is [(-u - u)² + (-v - v)²] = [(-2u)² + (-2v)²] = 4u² + 4v² = 4(u² + v²). So BD² is 4(u² + v²). Therefore, we need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. So we need to find the infimum of BD² over all possible such rhombi, and then the greatest real number less than BD² would be the supremum of those lower bounds. Wait, actually, the problem says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi". So we need to find the maximum lower bound for BD² across all possible rhombi. That is, find the infimum of BD², which will be the greatest lower bound, and then the answer is that infimum. Wait, but the problem says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi". So if we have a lower bound for BD², then the greatest such number is the infimum. So we need to find the infimum of BD² over all possible rhombi, and that will be the answer.

Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the infimum of 4(u² + v²) given that:

1. The points A(x, y) and B(u, v) lie on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1.

2. The condition ux + vy = 0 holds.

So we need to minimize 4(u² + v²) subject to these constraints.

Alternatively, since 4 is a constant factor, we can minimize u² + v² subject to the constraints.

So the problem is to find the minimum of u² + v², given that:

u²/20 - v²/24 = 1

and ux + vy = 0, where x and y satisfy x²/20 - y²/24 = 1.

Hmm, this seems like an optimization problem with constraints. Let me see. Let's note that points A and B are related via the condition ux + vy = 0. So for each point A(x, y), there exists a point B(u, v) such that ux + vy = 0, and B lies on the hyperbola. So perhaps we can parametrize A and then express B in terms of A, then compute u² + v² in terms of x and y, and then minimize that.

Alternatively, maybe we can use Lagrange multipliers here. Let's consider variables u, v, x, y with the constraints:

1. u²/20 - v²/24 = 1

2. x²/20 - y²/24 = 1

3. ux + vy = 0

We need to minimize u² + v².

Wait, but variables are u, v, x, y. So that's four variables with three constraints. Hmm, maybe we can express u and v in terms of x and y, or vice versa.

From the third constraint: ux + vy = 0 => v = -(ux)/y, provided y ≠ 0.

Then substitute into the first constraint:

u²/20 - [ ( -ux/y )² ] / 24 = 1

=> u²/20 - (u²x²)/(y² * 24) = 1

Factor out u²:

u² [ 1/20 - x²/(24 y²) ] = 1

Similarly, the second constraint is x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. Let's denote this as equation (1):

x²/20 - y²/24 = 1

We can express x² from equation (1):

x² = 20(1 + y²/24) = 20 + (20 y²)/24 = 20 + (5 y²)/6

So x² = 20 + (5 y²)/6

Therefore, substitute x² into the expression for u²:

u² [ 1/20 - (20 + (5 y²)/6 )/(24 y²) ] = 1

Simplify the term in the brackets:

1/20 - [20 + (5 y²)/6 ]/(24 y²) = 1/20 - [20/(24 y²) + (5 y²)/(24 y² * 6) ]

Simplify term by term:

First term: 20/(24 y²) = 5/(6 y²)

Second term: (5 y²)/(24 y² * 6) = 5/(144) = 5/144

Therefore, the bracket becomes:

1/20 - [5/(6 y²) + 5/144] = 1/20 - 5/(6 y²) - 5/144

Combine constants:

1/20 - 5/144 = (72/1440 - 50/1440) = 22/1440 = 11/720

So the bracket is 11/720 - 5/(6 y²)

Therefore, the equation becomes:

u² [11/720 - 5/(6 y²)] = 1

Therefore, u² = 1 / [11/720 - 5/(6 y²)]

So u² = 1 / [ (11/720) - (5)/(6 y²) ]

Now, our goal is to compute u² + v². Since v = - (u x)/y, then v² = (u² x²)/y²

So u² + v² = u² + (u² x²)/y² = u² [1 + x²/y²]

But x² is 20 + (5 y²)/6, so x²/y² = 20/y² + 5/6

Therefore, u² + v² = u² [1 + 20/y² + 5/6] = u² [25/6 + 20/y²]

But u² is 1 / [11/720 - 5/(6 y²)] = 1 / [ (11/720) - (5)/(6 y²) ]

Therefore, u² + v² = [25/6 + 20/y²] / [11/720 - 5/(6 y²)]

Let me simplify this expression.

First, let's write all terms in terms of y². Let me denote z = y². Then, z > 0, since y ≠ 0 (otherwise, from the hyperbola equation x²/20 - y²/24 =1, if y=0, then x²=20, so x=±√20, but then v would be undefined since from v = - (ux)/y, if y=0, it's undefined. So y cannot be zero. Therefore, z > 0.

So, substituting z = y², we have:

u² + v² = [25/6 + 20/z] / [11/720 - 5/(6 z)]

Let me compute numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: 25/6 + 20/z = (25 z + 120)/6 z

Denominator: 11/720 - 5/(6 z) = (11 z - 600)/720 z

Therefore, the entire expression becomes:

[ (25 z + 120)/6 z ] / [ (11 z - 600)/720 z ] = [ (25 z + 120)/6 z ] * [720 z / (11 z - 600) ]

Simplify:

(25 z + 120)/6 z * 720 z / (11 z - 600) = (25 z + 120) * 720 / [6 (11 z - 600)]

Simplify the constants:

720 / 6 = 120

Therefore:

(25 z + 120) * 120 / (11 z - 600)

Factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 25 z + 120 = 5(5 z + 24)

Denominator: 11 z - 600 = 11 z - 600

So:

5(5 z + 24) * 120 / (11 z - 600) = 600(5 z + 24) / (11 z - 600)

Therefore, u² + v² = 600(5 z + 24)/(11 z - 600)

But we need to express this in terms of z and find its minimum value. However, z is related to y², which is a variable we can adjust. But we need to make sure that the original constraints are satisfied, particularly that the points lie on the hyperbola. Wait, but we already substituted using the hyperbola equation, so z is a free variable here, but subject to the condition that the denominator 11 z - 600 ≠ 0. Also, since the hyperbola equation x²/20 - y²/24 =1 must be satisfied, z must be such that x² = 20 + (5 z)/6 is positive. Since z > 0, x² is always positive. However, we also need to ensure that the denominator in the expression for u² + v² is positive, otherwise, the expression would be negative, which is impossible since u² + v² is always positive. Therefore, 11 z - 600 > 0 => z > 600/11 ≈ 54.545.

Therefore, z must be greater than 600/11, which is approximately 54.545. So z ∈ (600/11, ∞).

Therefore, our expression for u² + v² is 600(5 z + 24)/(11 z - 600), and we need to find its minimum value for z > 600/11.

So let's denote f(z) = 600(5 z + 24)/(11 z - 600). We need to find the minimum of f(z) over z > 600/11.

To find the minimum, let's take the derivative of f(z) with respect to z and set it equal to zero.

First, f(z) = 600*(5z + 24)/(11z - 600). Let's write this as f(z) = 600*(5z + 24)*(11z - 600)^(-1)

Compute f'(z) using the quotient rule:

f'(z) = [600*(5*(11z - 600) - (5z + 24)*11)] / (11z - 600)^2

Simplify the numerator:

600*[55z - 3000 - 55z - 264] = 600*(-3000 -264) = 600*(-3264) = -600*3264

Therefore, f'(z) = -600*3264 / (11z - 600)^2

Wait, that can't be right. Let me check the derivative again.

Wait, the derivative of numerator is 5* (11z - 600) + (5z +24)*11? Wait, no. Wait, the derivative of (5z +24) is 5, and the derivative of (11z -600) is 11. So using the quotient rule:

f'(z) = [5*(11z -600) - (5z +24)*11] * 600 / (11z -600)^2

Wait, no. Wait, f(z) = 600*(5z +24)/(11z -600). So f'(z) = 600*[ derivative of (5z +24)/(11z -600) ]

Using the quotient rule: derivative of numerator/denominator - numerator/denominator^2 * derivative denominator.

So derivative of (5z +24) is 5, derivative of (11z -600) is 11.

Therefore:

f'(z) = 600*[5*(11z -600) - (5z +24)*11] / (11z -600)^2

Compute the numerator inside the brackets:

5*(11z -600) - (5z +24)*11 = 55z -3000 -55z -264 = (55z -55z) + (-3000 -264) = -3264

Therefore, numerator is -3264. Therefore:

f'(z) = 600*(-3264)/(11z -600)^2

Which is a negative value for all z >600/11, since denominator squared is positive, and numerator is negative. Therefore, f(z) is decreasing for all z >600/11. Therefore, the minimum of f(z) occurs as z approaches 600/11 from the right. But z can't be equal to 600/11, because then the denominator becomes zero. So the infimum of f(z) is the limit as z approaches 600/11+.

Compute the limit as z approaches 600/11 from the right:

lim_{z→600/11+} f(z) = lim_{z→600/11+} 600(5z +24)/(11z -600)

Let me substitute z =600/11 + ε, where ε approaches 0+.

Then:

5z +24 =5*(600/11 + ε) +24 = 3000/11 +5ε +24 = 3000/11 +264/11 +5ε = (3000 +264)/11 +5ε =3264/11 +5ε

11z -600 =11*(600/11 + ε) -600 =600 +11ε -600 =11ε

Therefore:

f(z) =600*(3264/11 +5ε)/(11ε) =600*(3264/(11*11ε) +5ε/(11ε)) =600*(3264/(121ε) +5/11)

As ε approaches 0+, the term 3264/(121ε) dominates and tends to infinity, so the limit is infinity. Wait, that's not possible. If the derivative is always negative, then as z increases, f(z) decreases. Wait, but as z approaches 600/11 from the right, f(z) tends to infinity. As z approaches infinity, let's see what happens to f(z):

lim_{z→∞} 600(5z +24)/(11z -600) = lim 600*5z /11z =600*5/11=3000/11≈272.727

Therefore, as z increases, f(z) approaches 3000/11≈272.727 from above. Since the function is decreasing for all z>600/11, the minimum value is approached as z→∞, but never actually reaches 3000/11. Therefore, the infimum of u² + v² is 3000/11, and so the infimum of BD² is 4*(3000/11)=12000/11≈1090.909. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi is 12000/11. But wait, let's check again.

Wait, earlier, we had that BD² =4(u² + v²). So if the infimum of u² + v² is 3000/11, then infimum of BD² is 4*(3000/11)=12000/11. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD² for all rhombi is 12000/11. However, since BD² can be made arbitrarily close to 12000/11 by taking z to infinity (i.e., points A and B approaching infinity along the hyperbola), but never actually reaching it, the infimum is 12000/11. Therefore, the answer should be 12000/11, which is approximately 1090.909. But the problem asks for the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. Since BD² can be made arbitrarily close to 12000/11, but never less than that. Wait, actually, BD² approaches 12000/11 from above as z approaches infinity. Wait, but when z approaches infinity, u² + v² approaches 3000/11, so BD² approaches 12000/11. Therefore, BD² can be made as close to 12000/11 as desired, but never actually less than that. Wait, but the infimum is the greatest lower bound. Since BD² can be made arbitrarily close to 12000/11 from above, the infimum is 12000/11. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD² for all rhombi would be 12000/11, since BD² is always greater than or equal to 12000/11. Wait, but the problem says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi". So if BD² is always greater than or equal to 12000/11, then 12000/11 is the greatest lower bound. Therefore, the answer is 12000/11.

But let me verify this with an example. Let's take a point A approaching infinity on the hyperbola. The hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 =1, so as x becomes large, y ~ sqrt(24/20)x = sqrt(6/5)x. So as x→∞, y ~ sqrt(6/5)x. Then, point B is determined by the condition ux + vy=0. Let's see. If A is (x, y) ~ (x, sqrt(6/5)x), then point B must satisfy ux + vy=0. Let's suppose that for large x, u is proportional to x, and v is proportional to y. Then, ux + vy ~ x u + y v =0. If u ~ k x and v ~ m y, then k x² + m y² ~0. But y ~ sqrt(6/5)x, so k x² + m*(6/5)x² ~0. So (k + 6m/5)x² ~0. For this to be zero, we need k +6m/5=0. So m= -5k/6. Therefore, v ~ -5k/6 y. Then, BD²=4(u² +v²)=4(k² x² + (25k²/36)y²). Since y ~ sqrt(6/5)x, this is 4(k² x² +25k²/36*(6/5)x²)=4(k² x² +25k²/36*(6/5)x²)=4(k² x² + (25*6)/(36*5)k² x²)=4(k² x² + (150)/(180)k² x²)=4(k² x² + (5/6)k² x²)=4*(11/6 k² x²)= (44/6)k² x²= (22/3)k² x². Since x is approaching infinity, BD² is approaching infinity as well? Wait, but earlier analysis suggested that as z→∞, BD² approaches 12000/11. There seems to be a discrepancy here. Wait, perhaps my assumption that u and v are proportional to x and y is leading to BD² approaching infinity, but in reality, from the previous analysis, BD² approaches 12000/11. So maybe my example is not correct.

Wait, let's think again. If point A is (x, y), then point B is (u, v) such that ux + vy=0. Also, points A and B lie on the hyperbola. So if we take A approaching infinity, then B must approach some direction as well. But if A is at (x, y) with x→∞, then from the hyperbola equation, y ~ sqrt(24/20)x = sqrt(6/5)x. Then, the condition ux + vy=0, so u = - (v y)/x. Therefore, as x→∞, u ~ -v*(sqrt(6/5)x)/x = -v*sqrt(6/5). So u approaches a constant multiple of -v, but y is growing as x. Wait, but u is related to point B, which is also on the hyperbola. So if u is finite, then from the hyperbola equation u²/20 - v²/24 =1. If u is finite, then v² ~24(u²/20 +1), which is finite, but if u is proportional to x, which is approaching infinity, then v would have to be proportional to y, which is also approaching infinity. Wait, but if u is proportional to x, then from the condition ux + vy=0, v must be proportional to -ux/y. If x is approaching infinity, and y ~ sqrt(6/5)x, then v ~ -u x / (sqrt(6/5)x )= -u / sqrt(6/5). So v approaches a constant if u is constant. But if u is proportional to x, then v would approach -k sqrt(5/6) x, which is proportional to x. So if u ~ k x, then v ~ -k sqrt(5/6) x. Then, substituting into hyperbola equation for point B: u²/20 - v²/24 =1 => (k² x²)/20 - (k²*(5/6)x²)/24 =1 => (k² x²)/20 - (5k² x²)/(144) =1. Combine terms: x² [k²/20 -5k²/144] =1. Factor out k² x²: k² x² [1/20 -5/144] =1. Compute 1/20 -5/144: 1/20=7.2/144, 5/144 is 5/144. So 7.2/144 -5/144=2.2/144=11/720. Therefore, k² x²*(11/720)=1 => x²=720/(11 k²). But we assumed x→∞, which would require k=0, which would contradict u ~k x. Therefore, this suggests that if u and v are both proportional to x and y, then the hyperbola equation can't be satisfied for large x. Therefore, maybe my previous approach was incorrect. Therefore, perhaps the minimal BD² is indeed 12000/11≈1090.909, and BD² can be made arbitrarily close to this value by choosing points A and B far away from the origin. Wait, but if BD² approaches 12000/11, which is approximately 1090.909, which is a finite number. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe my mistake was in the substitution when I expressed u² + v² in terms of z. Let me check that again.

We had:

u² + v² = 600(5 z +24)/(11 z -600)

And we found that as z approaches 600/11 from above, this expression tends to infinity, and as z approaches infinity, it tends to 3000/11≈272.727. Therefore, the infimum of u² +v² is 3000/11, achieved as z→infty. Therefore, the infimum of BD²=4(u² +v²) is 12000/11≈1090.909. Therefore, BD² can be made arbitrarily close to 12000/11 from above, but never less than that. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD² for all rhombi is 12000/11. So the answer is 12000/11.

But let me check if there's a way to confirm this result. Let's take a specific example where BD²=12000/11. Suppose BD²=12000/11, then u² +v²=3000/11. Then, we can find points A and B such that u² +v²=3000/11 and ux + vy=0. Let's assume that points A and B are such that u²/20 -v²/24=1 and x²/20 - y²/24=1, and ux + vy=0. Let's try to solve for such points.

Let me set u² +v²=3000/11. Let me denote u²= a, v²= b, so a + b=3000/11. Also, u²/20 -v²/24=1 => a/20 - b/24=1. So we have two equations:

1. a + b =3000/11

2. a/20 - b/24=1

Let's solve this system. Multiply equation 2 by 120 to eliminate denominators:

6a -5b=120

Equation 1: a + b=3000/11

From equation 1: a=3000/11 -b

Substitute into equation 6a -5b=120:

6*(3000/11 -b) -5b=120

18000/11 -6b -5b=120

18000/11 -11b=120

Multiply both sides by 11:

18000 -121b=1320

18000 -1320=121b

16680=121b

b=16680/121≈137.851

Then a=3000/11 -16680/121= (3000*11 -16680)/121=(33000 -16680)/121=16320/121≈135.000

Therefore, a=16320/121≈135, b=16680/121≈137.851

Therefore, u=±sqrt(16320/121)=±sqrt(16320)/11≈±127.8/11≈±11.62, and v=±sqrt(16680/121)=±sqrt(16680)/11≈±129.15/11≈±11.74

But we also have the condition ux + vy=0. Let's check if this is possible.

Let me take u=127.8/11≈11.62, v=129.15/11≈11.74

We need to find x and y such that:

x²/20 - y²/24=1

and

u x +v y=0 => (127.8/11)x + (129.15/11)y=0 =>127.8x +129.15y=0 => y= -127.8/129.15 x≈-0.989x

Substitute y≈-0.989x into the hyperbola equation:

x²/20 - (-0.989x)²/24=1

x²/20 - (0.978x²)/24=1

x²(1/20 -0.978/24)=1

Compute 1/20=0.05, 0.978/24≈0.04075

Thus, x²(0.05 -0.04075)=x²(0.00925)=1 =>x²≈108.108 =>x≈±10.4

Therefore, y≈-0.989*10.4≈-10.28

Therefore, point A is approximately (10.4, -10.28). Let's check if this lies on the hyperbola:

x²/20=10.4²/20≈108.16/20≈5.408

y²/24=10.28²/24≈105.678/24≈4.403

5.408 -4.403≈1.005≈1. Close enough considering rounding errors. Therefore, such points A and B exist where BD²=12000/11≈1090.909. Therefore, the infimum is achieved in the limit as points go to infinity, but BD² can be equal to 12000/11. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi is 12000/11.

Therefore, the answer is 12000/11, which is approximately 1090.909.

**Final Answer**
The greatest real number less than \( BD^2 \) for all such rhombi is \(\boxed{\dfrac{12000}{11}}\).
Therefore, the greatest real number less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi is $\boxed{\frac{12000}{11}}$.
