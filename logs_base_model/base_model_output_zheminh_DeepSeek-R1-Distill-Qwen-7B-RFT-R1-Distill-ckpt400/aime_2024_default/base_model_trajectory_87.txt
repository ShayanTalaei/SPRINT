Okay, so I need to find the greatest four-digit number N with a specific property. The property is that if any single digit of N is changed to 1, the resulting number must be divisible by 7. Then, once I find N, I have to divide it by 1000 to get Q (the quotient) and R (the remainder), and add them together for the final answer. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's understand the problem. N is a four-digit number, so it ranges from 1000 to 9999. The key condition here is that changing any one digit of N to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. Since there are four digits, there are four possible changes (changing the thousands digit, hundreds digit, tens digit, or units digit to 1). Each of these changes must result in a number divisible by 7.

So, if N is ABCD (where A, B, C, D are digits from 0-9, with A ≠ 0), then changing A to 1 gives 1BCD, changing B to 1 gives A1CD, changing C to 1 gives AB1D, and changing D to 1 gives ABC1. Each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7.

My goal is to find the largest such N. Since we want the greatest four-digit number, we should start checking from 9999 and go downwards, checking each number to see if it satisfies the condition. However, this might be time-consuming, so I need a smarter approach.

Let me think about the mathematical implications. Let's denote the original number as N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D. When we change a digit to 1, we are essentially modifying one of the place values. For example, changing the thousands digit to 1 would result in 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D. Similarly, changing the hundreds digit to 1 gives 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D, and so on.

Each of these modified numbers must be divisible by 7. Let's denote these modified numbers as follows:

- Changing A: M_A = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D
- Changing B: M_B = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D
- Changing C: M_C = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D
- Changing D: M_D = 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1

Each of these M_A, M_B, M_C, M_D must be congruent to 0 modulo 7. So, we can write the following congruences:

1. M_A ≡ 0 mod 7 → 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
2. M_B ≡ 0 mod 7 → 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
3. M_C ≡ 0 mod 7 → 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7
4. M_D ≡ 0 mod 7 → 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Now, let's compute the coefficients modulo 7 to simplify these expressions. Since 1000 ≡ 1000 mod 7. Let's compute 1000 mod 7. 7*142=994, so 1000 - 994 = 6. So 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

Similarly, 100 mod 7: 100 - 7*14=100-98=2, so 100 ≡ 2 mod 7.

10 mod 7: 10 - 7=3, so 10 ≡ 3 mod 7.

1 mod 7 is 1.

So, substituting these into the congruences:

1. M_A ≡ 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
2. M_B ≡ 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
3. M_C ≡ 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡ 0 mod 7
4. M_D ≡ 6A + 2B + 3C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

So, now we have four congruences:

1. 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7  → (Equation 1)
2. 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7  → (Equation 2)
3. 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡ 0 mod 7  → (Equation 3)
4. 6A + 2B + 3C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7  → (Equation 4)

Our goal is to find digits A, B, C, D (with A ≠ 0) such that all four equations are satisfied. Since N is a four-digit number, A is from 1 to 9, and B, C, D are from 0 to 9.

Moreover, since we want the greatest N, we should start checking numbers from 9999 downwards and see if they satisfy all four equations. However, doing this manually would be tedious, so we need to find a way to reduce the possibilities.

First, let's note that Equations 1, 2, 3, and 4 must all be congruent to 0 mod 7. Let's try to express some variables in terms of others.

Let me subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:

Equation 2 - Equation 1:

(6A + 2 + 3C + D) - (6 + 2B + 3C + D) ≡ 0 - 0 mod 7

Simplify:

6A + 2 + 3C + D -6 -2B -3C -D ≡ 0 mod 7

Simplify terms:

6A -6 -2B + (3C -3C) + (D - D) +2 -6 ≡ 0 mod 7

So:

6A -2B -4 ≡ 0 mod 7

Which simplifies to:

6A -2B ≡ 4 mod 7

We can divide both sides by 2 (since 2 and 7 are coprime, this is allowed):

3A - B ≡ 2 mod 7  → (Equation 5)

Similarly, subtract Equation 1 from Equation 3:

Equation 3 - Equation 1:

(6A + 2B + 3 + D) - (6 + 2B + 3C + D) ≡ 0 - 0 mod 7

Simplify:

6A + 2B + 3 + D -6 -2B -3C -D ≡ 0 mod 7

Simplify terms:

6A -6 -3C + (2B -2B) + (D - D) +3 ≡ 0 mod 7

So:

6A -6 -3C +3 ≡ 0 mod 7

Simplify:

6A -3C -3 ≡ 0 mod 7

Divide through by 3 (since 3 and 7 are coprime):

2A - C -1 ≡ 0 mod 7

So:

2A - C ≡ 1 mod 7  → (Equation 6)

Now, subtract Equation 1 from Equation 4:

Equation 4 - Equation 1:

(6A + 2B + 3C +1) - (6 + 2B + 3C + D) ≡ 0 - 0 mod 7

Simplify:

6A + 2B + 3C +1 -6 -2B -3C -D ≡ 0 mod 7

Simplify terms:

6A -6 -D + (2B -2B) + (3C -3C) +1 ≡ 0 mod 7

So:

6A -6 -D +1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Simplify:

6A -5 -D ≡ 0 mod 7

Which gives:

6A - D ≡ 5 mod 7  → (Equation 7)

So now, we have three equations:

Equation 5: 3A - B ≡ 2 mod 7

Equation 6: 2A - C ≡ 1 mod 7

Equation 7: 6A - D ≡ 5 mod 7

These equations relate the digits A, B, C, D. Let's see if we can express B, C, D in terms of A.

From Equation 5:

B ≡ 3A - 2 mod 7

Since B is a digit from 0 to 9, possible values of B can be determined once A is known. Similarly, from Equation 6:

C ≡ 2A -1 mod 7

And from Equation 7:

D ≡ 6A -5 mod 7

But since C and D must be digits (0-9), we need to ensure that 2A -1 mod 7 is between 0 and 9, and similarly 6A -5 mod 7 is between 0 and 9. However, since mod 7, the values can wrap around, but we can compute the possible values of C and D based on A.

Additionally, from Equation 1:

6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7

We can substitute B, C, D from Equations 5, 6, 7 into Equation 1 to check consistency. Let's try that.

From Equation 5: B = 3A - 2 mod 7

From Equation 6: C = 2A -1 mod 7

From Equation 7: D = 6A -5 mod 7

So substitute these into Equation 1:

6 + 2*(3A - 2) + 3*(2A -1) + (6A -5) ≡ 0 mod 7

Compute each term:

6 + 2*(3A -2) = 6 + 6A -4 = 6A + 2

3*(2A -1) = 6A -3

(6A -5) remains as is.

Combine all terms:

6A + 2 + 6A -3 + 6A -5 = (6A + 6A +6A) + (2 -3 -5) = 18A -6

So:

18A -6 ≡ 0 mod 7

Simplify 18 mod 7: 18 ÷7=2*7=14, 18-14=4. So 18 ≡4 mod7

Therefore:

4A -6 ≡0 mod7 → 4A ≡6 mod7 → Multiply both sides by the inverse of 4 mod7. Since 4*2=8≡1 mod7, inverse of 4 is 2.

Thus:

A ≡6*2=12≡5 mod7

Therefore, A ≡5 mod7. Since A is a digit from 1 to9, possible values of A are 5 and 5+7=12, but 12 is invalid. So A=5.

Wait, that's a key point. So A must be congruent to 5 modulo7. Therefore, possible values for A are 5, 12, 19,... but since A is a digit (1-9), only A=5 is possible. Therefore, A=5.

So now, we have A=5. Let's compute B, C, D based on this.

From Equation 5:

B ≡3A -2 mod7 =3*5 -2=15-2=13≡6 mod7. So B=6 mod7. Since B is a digit (0-9), B can be 6 or 6+7=13, but 13 is invalid. So B=6.

From Equation 6:

C ≡2A -1 mod7=2*5 -1=10-1=9≡2 mod7. So C=2 mod7. Since C is a digit, possible values are 2 or 2+7=9. So C=2 or 9.

From Equation 7:

D ≡6A -5 mod7=6*5 -5=30-5=25≡4 mod7. So D=4 mod7. Since D is a digit, possible values are 4 or 4+7=11, but 11 is invalid. So D=4.

So now, we have A=5, B=6, D=4, and C can be 2 or 9.

Therefore, we have two possibilities for C: 2 or 9. Let's check both.

First possibility: C=2

Then N = 5 6 2 4. Let's check the four conditions.

1. Change thousands digit: 1 6 2 4 =1624. Check if 1624 is divisible by7: 1624 ÷7. 7*232=1624. Yes, 7*232=1624. So divisible by7.

2. Change hundreds digit: 5 1 2 4=5124. Check 5124 ÷7. 7*732=5124. 7*700=4900, 7*32=224, 4900+224=5124. Yes, divisible by7.

3. Change tens digit: 5 6 1 4=5614. Check 5614 ÷7. 7*802=5614. 7*800=5600, 7*2=14. 5600+14=5614. Yes.

4. Change units digit: 5 6 2 1=5621. Check 5621 ÷7. 7*803=5621. 7*800=5600, 7*3=21. 5600+21=5621. Yes.

So all four numbers are divisible by7. Therefore, N=5624 is a candidate.

Second possibility: C=9

Then N=5 6 9 4. Let's check each condition.

1. Change thousands digit:1 6 9 4=1694. Check divisibility by7. 7*242=1694. 7*200=1400, 7*40=280, 7*2=14. 1400+280+14=1694. Yes.

2. Change hundreds digit:5 1 9 4=5194. Check 5194 ÷7. 7*742=5194. 7*700=4900, 7*42=294. 4900+294=5194. Yes.

3. Change tens digit:5 6 1 4=5614. Wait, we already checked this earlier when C=2. It is 5614, which is divisible by7. So same as before.

4. Change units digit:5 6 9 1=5691. Check 5691 ÷7. Let's compute 5691 ÷7. 7*813=5691. 7*800=5600, 7*13=91. 5600+91=5691. Yes.

So N=5694 also satisfies all four conditions. So both 5624 and 5694 are possible candidates. Since we need the greatest four-digit number, between 5694 and 5624, 5694 is larger. Therefore, N=5694 is the candidate.

Wait, but let me confirm that there are no higher Ns. Since A=5, changing the thousands digit to 1 gives 1xxx, which is lower than 5xxx, so to get the maximum N, we need the largest possible thousands digit. Since 5 is the only possible value for A (from A≡5 mod7 and A must be a digit from1-9), the maximum N would be when A=5, B is maximum possible, then C is maximum possible, then D is maximum possible.

But in our case, for A=5, B=6 (since B≡6 mod7, possible values 6 or 13, but 13 is invalid). So B=6. Then C can be 2 or 9. Since 9 is larger, we take C=9, leading to N=5694.

But let's check if there's a higher number with the same A=5, but maybe higher C and D? Wait, C is determined by 2A-1 mod7=9≡2 mod7, so C can be 2 or 9. So 9 is the higher digit. Similarly, D is determined by 6A-5 mod7=4, so D=4. So D is fixed as 4. So the maximum N with A=5, B=6, C=9, D=4 is 5694.

Wait, but is there a higher number with A=5, B=6, C=9, D=4? 5694 is the only one with these digits. So that's the maximum possible.

But let me confirm if C=9 is allowed. Since C is a digit, 9 is allowed. Similarly, D=4 is allowed. So 5694 is the maximum.

But before finalizing, let's check if there's any higher number with A=5, but maybe a different B? Wait, B was determined as 6 mod7, so B=6 is the only possible digit. Since B is 6, and 6 is the highest possible digit in that position (since 6+7=13 is invalid). So B=6.

Therefore, the maximum number is 5694. Let me check if this is indeed the maximum possible.

Wait, let's check N=5694. When we change any digit to1:

1. Changing thousands digit:1694, which is 7*242=1694. Good.

2. Changing hundreds digit:5194, which is 7*742=5194. Good.

3. Changing tens digit:5614, which is 7*802=5614. Good.

4. Changing units digit:5691, which is 7*813=5691. Good.

All four are divisible by7. So 5694 is a valid candidate.

But wait, is there a higher number with the same properties? For example, could there be a number higher than 5694 where changing any digit to1 results in a multiple of7?

Suppose we try 5994. Let's check:

Change thousands digit:1994. 1994 ÷7=284.857..., not an integer. So 1994 is not divisible by7. So 5994 is invalid.

Similarly, 5894: changing thousands digit:1894. 1894 ÷7=270.571..., not integer. So invalid.

What about 5794? Changing thousands digit:1794. 1794 ÷7=256.285..., not integer. So invalid.

So 5694 is the highest possible when A=5, B=6, C=9, D=4.

But let's check another possibility. Suppose there's a higher number where A=5, B=6, C=9, D=4. But since D is fixed by the equations, we can't change D. So 5694 is the maximum.

Alternatively, is there a higher number with A=5, B=6, C=9, D=4? No, because D is fixed. So 5694 is the only one.

But wait, let me check if there's a number higher than 5694 with the same properties. For instance, 5699. But changing units digit to1 gives 5691, which is divisible by7, but changing the tens digit to1 gives 5619. Let's check 5619 ÷7. 7*802=5614, 5614+5=5619. 5619-5614=5. So remainder 5. So 5619 is not divisible by7. Therefore, 5699 is invalid.

Similarly, 5689: changing hundreds digit to1 gives 5189. 5189 ÷7. 7*741=5187, remainder 2. Not divisible by7. So invalid.

Therefore, 5694 seems to be the maximum.

But let me verify with another approach. Let's suppose N=5694. Let's check all four conditions again.

Change thousands digit:1694. 1694 ÷7=242. Exactly. Good.

Change hundreds digit:5194. 5194 ÷7=742. Exactly. Good.

Change tens digit:5614. 5614 ÷7=802. Exactly. Good.

Change units digit:5691. 5691 ÷7=813. Exactly. Good.

All four are divisible by7, so N=5694 is valid.

But wait, is there a higher number with A=5, B=6, C=9, D=4? Since D is fixed, and C is fixed as 9, and B is 6, and A is 5, there's no way to get a higher number. So 5694 is the maximum.

But just to be thorough, let's check if there's a number higher than 5694 that could satisfy the conditions. For example, 5695. Let's check:

Change thousands digit:1695. 1695 ÷7=242.142..., not integer. So invalid.

Similarly, 5696: changing thousands digit to1 gives 1696. 1696 ÷7=242.285..., not integer.

5697: changing thousands digit gives1697. 1697 ÷7=242.428..., not integer.

5698: changing thousands digit gives1698. 1698 ÷7=242.571..., not integer.

5699: as before, invalid.

Therefore, 5694 is indeed the maximum.

But wait, let me check another angle. Suppose we take A=5, but maybe a different combination of B, C, D. For example, if C=2 instead of 9, we get N=5624. But 5624 is less than 5694, so 5694 is the higher one.

Therefore, N=5694.

Now, the problem asks for Q and R when N is divided by 1000. So Q is the quotient and R is the remainder.

Dividing 5694 by 1000:

5694 ÷1000=5 with remainder 694. So Q=5, R=694.

Therefore, Q+R=5+694=699.

Wait, but let me confirm once again. 5*1000=5000, 5694-5000=694. Yes, correct. So Q=5, R=694, sum is 699.

But wait, hold on. Let me check if 5694 is indeed the maximum. Suppose there exists a number higher than 5694, say 5994. But as we saw earlier, changing thousands digit to1 gives 1994, which is not divisible by7. So invalid.

Alternatively, 5794: changing thousands digit gives1794, which is not divisible by7. So invalid.

Similarly, 5894: changing thousands digit gives1894, which is not divisible by7. So invalid.

Therefore, 5694 is indeed the maximum. Therefore, the answer is 699.

But let me just check once again if there's a mistake in the equations. Let's verify the equations with N=5694.

Equation 1: 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡0 mod7. B=6, C=9, D=4.

6 + 2*6 + 3*9 +4 =6 +12 +27 +4=49. 49 mod7=0. Correct.

Equation 2: 6A +2 +3C +D ≡0 mod7. A=5, C=9, D=4.

6*5 +2 +3*9 +4=30 +2 +27 +4=63. 63 mod7=0. Correct.

Equation 3:6A +2B +3 +D ≡0 mod7. A=5, B=6, D=4.

6*5 +2*6 +3 +4=30 +12 +3 +4=49. 49 mod7=0. Correct.

Equation 4:6A +2B +3C +1 ≡0 mod7. A=5, B=6, C=9.

6*5 +2*6 +3*9 +1=30 +12 +27 +1=70. 70 mod7=0. Correct.

All equations are satisfied. Therefore, N=5694 is correct.

Therefore, Q=5, R=694. Q+R=5+694=699.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{699}
Therefore, the greatest four-digit number \( N \) with the given property is 5694. When divided by 1000, the quotient \( Q \) is 5 and the remainder \( R \) is 694. Thus, \( Q + R = 5 + 694 = 699 \).
