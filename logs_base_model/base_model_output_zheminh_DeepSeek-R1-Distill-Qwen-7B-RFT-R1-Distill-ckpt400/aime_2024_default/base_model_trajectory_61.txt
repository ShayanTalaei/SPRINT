Okay, so I need to solve this geometry problem. Let me read it again carefully.

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents at points B and C intersect at point D. Then line AD intersects the circle ω again at point P. We are given the lengths of the sides: AB is 5, BC is 9, and AC is 10. We need to find the length of AP, expressed as a reduced fraction m/n, and then compute m + n.

Hmm, let me visualize the problem. Triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. Since these are the sides of a triangle, maybe I can sketch this triangle first. Let me note down the given sides:

AB = 5, BC = 9, AC = 10.

So ABC is a triangle with AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. Let me check if this is a valid triangle. The sum of AB + BC = 5 + 9 = 14, which is greater than AC = 10. Similarly, other combinations also hold, so yes, it's a valid triangle.

Now, the triangle is inscribed in a circle ω. So ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. The tangents at B and C meet at point D. Then AD is drawn, and it intersects ω again at P. We need to find AP.

First, let me recall some properties related to tangents to a circle. The point where two tangents meet has some important properties. For instance, in a circle, the two tangent segments from a single external point to the circle are equal in length. So, if D is the intersection of tangents at B and C, then DB = DC. That might come in handy.

Also, since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, D lies on the external angle bisector of angle BAC. Wait, is that true? Let me think. The external angle bisector? Or maybe it's related to the symmedian.

Alternatively, perhaps using power of a point. The power of point D with respect to circle ω is equal to DB² = DC². Since DB and DC are tangent lengths from D to ω. Also, power of D can be expressed as DA * DP, since AD is a secant line passing through D and intersecting ω at A and P. Therefore, DB² = DA * DP.

That seems like a useful relation. If I can compute DB, then I can relate DA and DP. If I can find DA, then DP can be found, and hence AP = DA - DP or something? Wait, need to be careful with the lengths.

Wait, point D is outside the circle ω, and AD is a secant that passes through A and P. So, the power of D with respect to ω is equal to DB² = DA * DP. So, if I can compute DB, then I can find DP in terms of DA. Then, since AP = DA - DP, that would give AP.

But first, how do I compute DB? Hmm. Let me think. Since D is the intersection of tangents at B and C, and we know coordinates or something? Maybe coordinate geometry could help here. Alternatively, using triangle properties.

Alternatively, maybe using inversion. But inversion might be complicated. Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe using coordinates. Let me place the triangle ABC in the coordinate plane so that computations can be easier.

Let me try coordinate geometry. Let me place point A at (0, 0), point B at (5, 0), since AB = 5. Then, point C is somewhere such that AC = 10 and BC = 9. Let me compute coordinates of C.

Coordinates of A: (0, 0)

Coordinates of B: (5, 0)

Coordinates of C: Let’s denote it as (x, y). Then, AC = 10: distance from A to C is sqrt(x² + y²) = 10 => x² + y² = 100.

Distance from B to C is 9: sqrt((x - 5)² + y²) = 9 => (x - 5)² + y² = 81.

Subtracting the first equation from the second:

(x - 5)² + y² - (x² + y²) = 81 - 100 => x² -10x +25 + y² -x² - y² = -19 => -10x +25 = -19 => -10x = -44 => x = 4.4

So x = 22/5. Then, from x² + y² = 100, we have y² = 100 - (22/5)² = 100 - 484/25 = (2500 - 484)/25 = 2016/25 => y = sqrt(2016)/5. Let's compute sqrt(2016):

2016 = 16 * 126 = 16 * 9 * 14 = 16 * 9 * 14 => sqrt(2016) = 4 * 3 * sqrt(14) = 12 sqrt(14). Therefore, y = 12 sqrt(14)/5.

So coordinates of C are (22/5, 12√14/5).

So, points:

A: (0, 0)

B: (5, 0)

C: (22/5, 12√14/5)

Now, we need to find the coordinates of point D, which is the intersection of the tangents to the circumcircle ω at B and C.

First, let's find the equation of the tangent at B to the circumcircle ω. Similarly, the tangent at C.

To find the tangent lines, we need the equation of the circumcircle ω. Since ω passes through A, B, and C, we can find its equation.

Let me compute the circumcircle equation. Let’s denote the circumcircle as (x - h)² + (y - k)² = r².

Plugging in points A, B, C:

For A (0,0):

h² + k² = r². (1)

For B (5,0):

(5 - h)² + k² = r². (2)

For C (22/5, 12√14/5):

(22/5 - h)² + (12√14/5 - k)² = r². (3)

Subtract equation (1) from equation (2):

(5 - h)² + k² - (h² + k²) = 0 => 25 -10h + h² - h² = 0 => 25 -10h = 0 => h = 25/10 = 5/2.

So h = 5/2. Then, from equation (1):

(5/2)² + k² = r² => 25/4 + k² = r².

Now, substitute h = 5/2 into equation (3):

(22/5 - 5/2)² + (12√14/5 - k)² = r².

First, compute 22/5 - 5/2. Let's find a common denominator, which is 10:

22/5 = 44/10, 5/2 = 25/10. So 44/10 -25/10 =19/10.

Similarly, 12√14/5 - k.

So equation (3) becomes:

(19/10)² + (12√14/5 - k)² = r².

Compute (19/10)² = 361/100.

So equation (3):

361/100 + (12√14/5 - k)^2 = r².

But from equation (1), r² = 25/4 + k². Therefore,

361/100 + (12√14/5 - k)^2 = 25/4 + k².

Let me expand the left side:

361/100 + (12√14/5)^2 - 2*(12√14/5)*k + k² = 25/4 + k².

Subtract k² from both sides:

361/100 + (12√14/5)^2 - (24√14/5)k = 25/4.

Compute (12√14/5)^2:

12² * (√14)^2 /5² = 144 *14 /25 = 2016/25.

So:

361/100 + 2016/25 - (24√14/5)k = 25/4.

Convert all terms to 100 denominators:

361/100 + (2016/25)*(4/4) = 2016*4/100 = 8064/100.

25/4 = 625/100.

So:

361/100 + 8064/100 - (24√14/5)k = 625/100.

Combine the first two terms:

(361 + 8064)/100 = 8425/100.

So:

8425/100 - (24√14/5)k = 625/100.

Subtract 625/100 from both sides:

(8425 - 625)/100 - (24√14/5)k = 0 => 7800/100 - (24√14/5)k = 0 => 78 - (24√14/5)k = 0.

Solve for k:

(24√14/5)k = 78 => k = 78 * 5 / (24√14) = (390)/(24√14) = (65)/(4√14).

Rationalize the denominator:

65/(4√14) * (√14/√14) = 65√14 / 56.

Therefore, k = 65√14 / 56.

So the center of the circumcircle ω is at (h, k) = (5/2, 65√14/56).

Now, the equation of the tangent at point B (5,0). The tangent at a point on a circle is perpendicular to the radius at that point. So the radius from center (5/2, 65√14/56) to B (5,0). The slope of this radius is (0 - 65√14/56)/(5 - 5/2) = (-65√14/56)/(5/2) = (-65√14/56)*(2/5) = (-130√14)/280 = (-13√14)/28.

Therefore, the slope of the radius is -13√14/28. Hence, the slope of the tangent at B is the negative reciprocal, which is 28/(13√14).

Similarly, the tangent at C. Let's compute that as well.

First, slope of radius from center to C: coordinates of C are (22/5, 12√14/5). Center is (5/2, 65√14/56). Let's compute the slope:

Slope = (12√14/5 - 65√14/56)/(22/5 - 5/2).

First, compute denominator: 22/5 -5/2 = (44/10 -25/10)=19/10.

Numerator: 12√14/5 -65√14/56. Let's convert to common denominator, which is 280.

12√14/5 = (12*56√14)/280 = 672√14/280

65√14/56 = (65*5√14)/280 = 325√14/280

So numerator: 672√14/280 - 325√14/280 = (672 - 325)√14/280 = 347√14/280.

Therefore, slope is (347√14/280)/(19/10) = (347√14/280)*(10/19) = (3470√14)/(5320) = (347√14)/532.

Simplify 347 and 532: 347 is a prime number? Let me check. 347 divided by primes: 2, no. 3: 3*115=345, remainder 2. 5: ends with 7, no. 7: 7*49=343, 347-343=4, so no. 11: 11*31=341, 347-341=6, no. 13: 13*26=338, 347-338=9, no. 17: 17*20=340, 347-340=7, no. 19: 19*18=342, 347-342=5, no. So 347 is prime. 532 divided by 347? 347*1=347, 532-347=185. 185=5*37. So no common factors. Therefore, slope is 347√14/532.

Therefore, the slope of the radius to C is 347√14/532. Therefore, the slope of the tangent at C is the negative reciprocal: -532/(347√14).

Therefore, now we have the equations of the two tangents at B and C.

Tangent at B: passes through (5, 0), slope 28/(13√14).

Equation: y - 0 = (28/(13√14))(x -5).

Similarly, tangent at C: passes through (22/5, 12√14/5), slope -532/(347√14).

Equation: y - 12√14/5 = (-532/(347√14))(x -22/5).

Now, to find point D, which is the intersection of these two tangents. So, solve the two equations:

1) y = (28/(13√14))(x -5)

2) y = (-532/(347√14))(x -22/5) + 12√14/5

Set them equal:

(28/(13√14))(x -5) = (-532/(347√14))(x -22/5) + 12√14/5

Multiply both sides by √14 to eliminate denominators:

28/13 (x -5) = -532/347 (x -22/5) + 12*14/5

Compute 12*14/5 = 168/5.

So:

28/13 (x -5) + 532/347 (x -22/5) = 168/5

Multiply both sides by 13*347 to eliminate denominators:

28*347 (x -5) + 532*13 (x -22/5) = 168/5 *13*347

Compute each term:

First term: 28*347 (x -5)

Second term: 532*13 (x -22/5)

Third term: (168/5)*13*347

Compute constants:

First term coefficient: 28*347. Let me compute 28*300=8400, 28*47=1316, so total 8400+1316=9716.

Second term coefficient: 532*13. 500*13=6500, 32*13=416, so total 6500+416=6916.

Third term: (168/5)*13*347. Let's compute 168*13=2184. Then 2184*347/5. Let me compute 2184*347 first.

Compute 2184*300=655,200

2184*47=2184*(40+7)=2184*40=87,360; 2184*7=15,288. So total 87,360+15,288=102,648.

So total 655,200 +102,648=757,848. Then divide by 5: 757,848 /5 = 151,569.6.

But since all other terms are integers, perhaps I need to keep it as fractions. Wait, maybe there's a better way. Let me see.

Wait, maybe instead of expanding all terms, let me do the equation step by step.

Original equation:

28/13 (x -5) + 532/347 (x -22/5) = 168/5

Multiply both sides by 13*347:

28*347 (x -5) + 532*13 (x -22/5) = (168/5)*13*347

Let me compute each coefficient:

28*347: 28*300=8400, 28*47=1316; total 8400+1316=9716

532*13: 500*13=6500, 32*13=416; total 6500+416=6916

Right-hand side: (168/5)*13*347 = (168*13)/5 *347 = (2184)/5 *347 = (2184*347)/5

Compute 2184*347:

Let me compute 2000*347=694,000

184*347: 100*347=34,700; 80*347=27,760; 4*347=1,388. So 34,700+27,760=62,460 +1,388=63,848

Total 694,000 +63,848=757,848

So RHS is 757,848 /5 = 151,569.6

But to keep fractions, it's 757,848/5.

Therefore, the equation becomes:

9716(x -5) +6916(x -22/5) =757,848/5

Expand the left side:

9716x -9716*5 +6916x -6916*(22/5) =757,848/5

Compute constants:

9716x +6916x = (9716 +6916)x = 16632x

-9716*5 = -48,580

-6916*(22/5) = -(6916*22)/5. Compute 6916*22:

6916*20=138,320; 6916*2=13,832; total 138,320+13,832=152,152. So -152,152/5.

Therefore, left side: 16632x -48,580 -152,152/5 =757,848/5

Convert -48,580 to fifths: -48,580 = -242,900/5.

So left side: 16632x -242,900/5 -152,152/5 =16632x - (242,900 +152,152)/5 =16632x -395,052/5

Set equal to RHS:

16632x -395,052/5 =757,848/5

Move constants to RHS:

16632x =757,848/5 +395,052/5 = (757,848 +395,052)/5 =1,152,900/5 =230,580

Therefore, x =230,580 /16632

Simplify this fraction.

First, divide numerator and denominator by 12: 230,580 ÷12=19,215; 16632 ÷12=1,386.

19,215 /1,386

Divide numerator and denominator by 3: 19,215 ÷3=6,405; 1,386 ÷3=462.

6,405 /462.

Divide numerator and denominator by 3 again: 6,405 ÷3=2,135; 462 ÷3=154.

2,135 /154.

Check if 154 divides into 2,135. 154*13=2,002. 2,135 -2,002=133. So 13 with remainder 133.

So 2,135/154=13 +133/154. Simplify 133/154. GCD of 133 and 154. 154=2*7*11; 133=7*19. So GCD is7. 133/154=19/22. Therefore, 2,135/154=13 +19/22=13.8636...

But we need to keep it as a fraction. So x=2,135/154.

Wait, let me check the computations again.

Wait, 230,580 /16632.

Let me see:

16632*13=16632*10 +16632*3=166,320 +49,896=216,216

230,580 -216,216=14,364

16632*0.8636≈14,364. So 13.8636.

But maybe we can divide numerator and denominator by GCD(230580,16632).

Find GCD(230580,16632). Let's apply Euclidean algorithm.

Compute GCD(230580,16632)

230580 ÷16632 =13, remainder 230580 -16632*13=230580 -216216=14,364

GCD(16632,14364)

16632 ÷14364=1, remainder 16632 -14364=2268

GCD(14364,2268)

14364 ÷2268=6, remainder 14364 -2268*6=14364 -13608=756

GCD(2268,756)

2268 ÷756=3, remainder 0

So GCD is756.

Therefore, 230580 ÷756=230580 /756= let's divide numerator and denominator by 12:756 ÷12=63;230580 ÷12=19215.

19215 ÷63=305. So 230580=756*305.

Similarly,16632 ÷756=16632 /756. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 12:756 ÷12=63;16632 ÷12=1386.

1386 ÷63=22. So 16632=756*22.

Therefore, x=230580 /16632=756*305 /756*22=305/22.

Therefore, x=305/22.

That's a much simpler fraction. So x=305/22.

Then, plug back into equation 1) y = (28/(13√14))(x -5).

Compute x -5=305/22 -5=305/22 -110/22=195/22.

So y=(28/(13√14))*(195/22)= (28*195)/(13*22√14)= (28*15)/(22√14) [since 195/13=15].

28*15=420. So 420/(22√14)=210/(11√14).

Rationalize denominator:

210/(11√14) * (√14/√14)=210√14/(11*14)=210√14/154=105√14/77=15√14/11.

Therefore, y=15√14/11.

So point D is at (305/22, 15√14/11).

Now, we need to find the equation of line AD. Points A (0,0) and D (305/22, 15√14/11). The slope of AD is (15√14/11 -0)/(305/22 -0)= (15√14/11)/(305/22)= (15√14/11)*(22/305)= (15√14*22)/(11*305)= (15√14*2)/305=30√14/305=6√14/61.

Therefore, slope of AD is 6√14/61.

Equation of AD: y = (6√14/61)x.

Now, we need to find the intersection point P of AD with ω again. Since A is already on both AD and ω, P is the other intersection point. So we need to solve the equation of ω and AD.

First, equation of ω is (x -5/2)^2 + (y -65√14/56)^2 = (5/2)^2 + (65√14/56)^2.

But maybe it's easier to use the power of point D with respect to ω.

Power of D: DB² = DA * DP.

From earlier, we have DA: distance from D to A.

Compute DA: distance between A (0,0) and D (305/22,15√14/11).

DA = sqrt( (305/22)^2 + (15√14/11)^2 )

Compute (305/22)^2: (305)^2=93025; 22²=484. So 93025/484.

(15√14/11)^2=225*14/121=3150/121.

Convert to common denominator:

93025/484 +3150/121=93025/484 + (3150*4)/484=93025/484 +12600/484= (93025 +12600)/484=105625/484.

Therefore, DA = sqrt(105625/484)=sqrt(105625)/sqrt(484)=325/22.

Therefore, DA=325/22.

Power of D: DB² = DA * DP.

DB is the length from D to B. Since D is the intersection of tangents at B and C, DB is equal to DC. Because tangents from a point to a circle are equal in length.

Wait, but DB is the length from D to B, which is equal to DC. But in this case, since D is the intersection of tangents at B and C, then DB = DC. So DB² = DC² = DA * DP.

But from power of point D, DB² = DA * DP.

We need to compute DB². Since we know coordinates of B (5,0) and D (305/22,15√14/11), compute DB.

Compute coordinates difference:

x: 305/22 -5=305/22 -110/22=195/22

y:15√14/11 -0=15√14/11

Therefore, DB² = (195/22)^2 + (15√14/11)^2.

Compute (195/22)^2:195²=38,025; 22²=484. So 38,025/484.

(15√14/11)^2=225*14/121=3150/121=3150/121.

Convert to common denominator:

38,025/484 +3150/121=38,025/484 + (3150*4)/484=38,025/484 +12,600/484=50,625/484.

Therefore, DB²=50,625/484.

From power of point D, DB²=DA * DP. We have DA=325/22. So:

50,625/484 = (325/22) * DP

Therefore, DP= (50,625/484) / (325/22)= (50,625/484)*(22/325)= (50,625*22)/(484*325)

Simplify:

50,625 ÷225=225*225=50,625. So 50,625=225*225.

484=22². 325=25*13.

Therefore:

(225*225 *22)/(22² *25*13)= (225*225*22)/(22² *25*13)= (225*225)/(22*25*13)

Simplify 225/25=9, so:

(9*225)/(22*13)= (2025)/(286)

Simplify 2025 ÷13=155.769. Wait, 2025 divided by 286. Let's check GCD(2025,286). 286=2*11*13. 2025=25*81=25*9². 2025 is divisible by 5,25, etc., but 13: 2025 ÷13=155.769. Not integer. So GCD is 1. Therefore, DP=2025/286.

Therefore, DP=2025/286. Then AP=AD - DP=325/22 -2025/286.

Convert to common denominator: 22 and286. 286=13*22. So common denominator is286.

325/22= (325*13)/286=4225/286

2025/286 remains.

Therefore, AP=4225/286 -2025/286=(4225 -2025)/286=2200/286.

Simplify 2200/286. Divide numerator and denominator by 2:1100/143.

Check GCD(1100,143). 143=11*13. 1100 ÷11=100. 100 and13 are coprime. So 1100/143=100/13.

Wait, 1100 ÷143=7.692. Wait, 143*7=1001, 1001+143=1144. So 1100-1001=99. So 1100=143*7 +99. Then 99=143*0 +99. So GCD(143,99). 143 ÷99=1 rem44. 99 ÷44=2 rem11. 44 ÷11=4 rem0. So GCD is11. Therefore, 1100 ÷11=100; 143 ÷11=13. Therefore, 1100/143=100/13. So AP=100/13.

Therefore, AP=100/13, so m=100, n=13. They are coprime. Therefore, m +n=113.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{113}
