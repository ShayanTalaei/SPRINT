Okay, let's see. I need to find real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that two logarithmic equations are equal to 10. The equations are log base x of y^x equals 10 and log base y of x^{4y} equals 10. Then I need to find the product xy. Hmm, okay. Let me start by recalling some logarithmic properties because this seems like it might involve converting between different log bases or manipulating the equations to express them in terms of each other.

First, let me write down the two equations separately to make it clearer. The first equation is log_x(y^x) = 10, and the second is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Since both are equal to 10, maybe I can set them equal to each other or find a relationship between x and y from both equations.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. Remember that log base a of b^c is equal to c * log_a(b). So applying that property here, this becomes x * log_x(y) = 10. Similarly, for the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Applying the same property, this becomes 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

So now I have two equations:

1. x * log_x(y) = 10
2. 4y * log_y(x) = 10

Hmm, okay. Now, I remember that log_a(b) is equal to 1 / log_b(a). So log_x(y) is 1 / log_y(x). Let me use that to rewrite the first equation. So, substituting that into equation 1:

x * (1 / log_y(x)) = 10

Which simplifies to x / log_y(x) = 10

Similarly, equation 2 is 4y * log_y(x) = 10. Let me write both equations again:

1. x / log_y(x) = 10
2. 4y * log_y(x) = 10

Now, let's denote log_y(x) as some variable to make it easier. Let me let k = log_y(x). Then, since log_y(x) = k, that means x = y^k. This is from the definition of logarithms: if log_b(a) = c, then a = b^c. So here, x = y^k.

Substituting x = y^k into equation 1:

(y^k) / k = 10

Which is y^k / k = 10.

And equation 2:

4y * k = 10

So now we have two equations with variables y and k:

1. y^k / k = 10
2. 4y * k = 10 => y * k = 10 / 4 => y * k = 2.5

So equation 2 gives y * k = 2.5. Therefore, y = 2.5 / k.

Substituting y = 2.5 / k into equation 1:

( (2.5 / k)^k ) / k = 10

Simplify that:

(2.5^k / k^k) / k = 10 => 2.5^k / k^{k + 1} = 10

So the equation becomes 2.5^k / k^{k + 1} = 10

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe taking natural logarithms on both sides could help? Let's try that.

Take ln of both sides:

ln(2.5^k / k^{k + 1}) = ln(10)

Using logarithm properties, this becomes:

ln(2.5^k) - ln(k^{k + 1}) = ln(10)

Which simplifies to:

k * ln(2.5) - (k + 1) * ln(k) = ln(10)

So:

k * ln(2.5) - (k + 1) * ln(k) = ln(10)

This is a transcendental equation in terms of k. It might not have a closed-form solution, so maybe I need to solve it numerically. But since this is a problem likely intended for algebraic manipulation, maybe there's a value of k that makes this equation true. Let's test some integer values of k first.

First, check if k=1:

Left side: 1 * ln(2.5) - 2 * ln(1) = ln(2.5) - 0 ≈ 0.9163 - 0 = 0.9163. Right side: ln(10) ≈ 2.3026. Not equal.

k=2:

Left side: 2 * ln(2.5) - 3 * ln(2) ≈ 2*0.9163 - 3*0.6931 ≈ 1.8326 - 2.0794 ≈ -0.2468. Not equal.

k=3:

Left side: 3 * ln(2.5) - 4 * ln(3) ≈ 3*0.9163 - 4*1.0986 ≈ 2.7489 - 4.3944 ≈ -1.6455. Not equal.

k=4:

Left side: 4*0.9163 - 5*ln(4) ≈ 3.6652 - 5*1.3863 ≈ 3.6652 - 6.9315 ≈ -3.2663. Not equal.

Hmm, negative values as k increases. Let's try k=0.5:

Left side: 0.5*ln(2.5) - 1.5*ln(0.5) ≈ 0.5*0.9163 - 1.5*(-0.6931) ≈ 0.45815 + 1.0397 ≈ 1.4978. Right side is 2.3026. Not equal.

k=0.4:

Left side: 0.4*0.9163 - 1.4*ln(0.4) ≈ 0.3665 - 1.4*(-0.9163) ≈ 0.3665 + 1.2828 ≈ 1.6493. Still less than 2.3026.

k=0.3:

Left side: 0.3*0.9163 - 1.3*ln(0.3) ≈ 0.2749 - 1.3*(-1.2039) ≈ 0.2749 + 1.5651 ≈ 1.84. Still less.

k=0.2:

Left side: 0.2*0.9163 - 1.2*ln(0.2) ≈ 0.1832 - 1.2*(-1.6094) ≈ 0.1832 + 1.9313 ≈ 2.1145. Closer to 2.3026.

k=0.15:

Left side: 0.15*0.9163 - 1.15*ln(0.15) ≈ 0.13745 - 1.15*(-1.8971) ≈ 0.13745 + 2.1816 ≈ 2.319. Oh, that's pretty close to 2.3026. So maybe k is approximately 0.15.

But let's check k=0.15:

Left side ≈ 2.319. Right side is 2.3026. Close. Maybe k≈0.15. Let's try k=0.145:

Left side: 0.145*0.9163 - 1.145*ln(0.145) ≈ 0.1324 - 1.145*(-1.9221) ≈ 0.1324 + 2.197 ≈ 2.3294. Still a bit higher.

k=0.14:

Left side: 0.14*0.9163 - 1.14*ln(0.14) ≈ 0.1283 - 1.14*(-1.9661) ≈ 0.1283 + 2.243 ≈ 2.3713. Hmm, that's even higher. Wait, maybe my calculations are off. Wait, ln(0.14) is negative, so subtracting a negative is adding. So as k decreases, ln(k) becomes more negative, so the term - (k + 1) ln(k) becomes more positive. So as k approaches 0 from the right, the left side approaches infinity. So maybe there's a solution around k=0.15 but perhaps a bit lower.

Wait, perhaps my initial substitution was wrong. Let's check again.

We have:

Equation 1: 2.5^k / k^{k + 1} = 10

Equation 2: y * k = 2.5, so y = 2.5 / k

And x = y^k = (2.5 / k)^k

So if we can find k such that 2.5^k / k^{k + 1} = 10, then we can find y and x.

Alternatively, maybe taking logarithms again. Let's take natural log of both sides:

k * ln(2.5) - (k + 1) * ln(k) = ln(10)

This is the equation we need to solve for k.

Let me denote f(k) = k * ln(2.5) - (k + 1) * ln(k) - ln(10)

We need to find k such that f(k) = 0.

We can use the Newton-Raphson method to approximate the solution. Let's start with an initial guess. Earlier, when k=0.15, f(k) was approximately 2.319 - 2.3026 = 0.0164. Wait, no, actually f(k) is k * ln(2.5) - (k + 1) * ln(k) - ln(10). Wait, when k=0.15:

f(0.15) = 0.15 * ln(2.5) - 1.15 * ln(0.15) - ln(10)

Compute each term:

0.15 * ln(2.5) ≈ 0.15 * 0.9163 ≈ 0.1374

1.15 * ln(0.15) ≈ 1.15 * (-1.8971) ≈ -2.1817

So f(0.15) ≈ 0.1374 - (-2.1817) - 2.3026 ≈ 0.1374 + 2.1817 - 2.3026 ≈ 2.3191 - 2.3026 ≈ 0.0165

So f(0.15) ≈ 0.0165. Close to zero but still positive. Let's try k=0.155:

f(0.155):

0.155 * ln(2.5) ≈ 0.155 * 0.9163 ≈ 0.1425

1.155 * ln(0.155) ≈ 1.155 * (-1.8633) ≈ -2.1559

So f(0.155) ≈ 0.1425 - (-2.1559) - 2.3026 ≈ 0.1425 + 2.1559 - 2.3026 ≈ 2.2984 - 2.3026 ≈ -0.0042

So f(0.155) ≈ -0.0042. So between k=0.15 and k=0.155, f(k) crosses zero.

Using linear approximation between these two points.

At k=0.15, f=0.0165

At k=0.155, f=-0.0042

The change in k is 0.005, and the change in f is -0.0207.

We need to find delta such that 0.0165 + (-0.0207 / 0.005) * delta = 0

Wait, actually, the slope is (f2 - f1)/(k2 - k1) = (-0.0042 - 0.0165)/(0.155 - 0.15) = (-0.0207)/0.005 = -4.14 per unit k.

We need to solve 0.0165 + (-4.14) * delta = 0

So delta ≈ 0.0165 / 4.14 ≈ 0.00398

Therefore, the root is approximately at k ≈ 0.15 + 0.00398 ≈ 0.15398

Let's check k=0.154:

f(0.154):

0.154 * ln(2.5) ≈ 0.154 * 0.9163 ≈ 0.1411

1.154 * ln(0.154) ≈ 1.154 * (-1.8743) ≈ -2.166

So f(0.154) ≈ 0.1411 - (-2.166) - 2.3026 ≈ 0.1411 + 2.166 - 2.3026 ≈ 2.3071 - 2.3026 ≈ 0.0045

Hmm, still positive. Wait, maybe my linear approximation was a bit off. Let's compute f(0.154):

0.154 * ln(2.5) ≈ 0.154 * 0.9163 ≈ 0.1411

1.154 * ln(0.154) ≈ 1.154 * (-1.8743) ≈ -2.166

Thus, f(0.154) = 0.1411 - (-2.166) - 2.3026 ≈ 0.1411 + 2.166 - 2.3026 ≈ 2.3071 - 2.3026 ≈ 0.0045

Still positive. Let's try k=0.153:

0.153 * ln(2.5) ≈ 0.153 * 0.9163 ≈ 0.140

1.153 * ln(0.153) ≈ 1.153 * (-1.890) ≈ -2.186

So f(0.153) ≈ 0.140 - (-2.186) - 2.3026 ≈ 0.140 + 2.186 - 2.3026 ≈ 2.326 - 2.3026 ≈ 0.0234

Wait, that can't be. Wait, 1.153 * ln(0.153): ln(0.153) ≈ -1.890, so 1.153 * (-1.890) ≈ -2.186. So f(k) = 0.140 - (-2.186) - 2.3026 = 0.140 + 2.186 - 2.3026 ≈ 2.326 - 2.3026 ≈ 0.0234. Hmm, so it's increasing as k decreases? Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, no, when k decreases, ln(k) becomes more negative, so -(k + 1) ln(k) becomes more positive. So f(k) increases as k decreases. Therefore, the function f(k) is increasing as k decreases. Therefore, since at k=0.15, f(k)=0.0165, at k=0.153, f(k)=0.0234, and at k=0.155, f(k)=-0.0042. Wait, that can't be. If the function is increasing as k decreases, then as k increases, the function decreases. So as k increases from 0.15 to 0.155, f(k) decreases from 0.0165 to -0.0042. So the root is between k=0.15 and k=0.155.

Wait, but when I tried k=0.153, which is between 0.15 and 0.155, f(k) was 0.0234, which is higher than at k=0.15. That suggests that the function is increasing as k decreases, as we thought. Therefore, the function is decreasing as k increases. Therefore, the root is between k=0.15 and k=0.153 where f(k) is still positive, and at k=0.155, it's negative. So the root is around 0.152 or so.

Alternatively, maybe use a better approximation method. Let's use the Newton-Raphson method with k=0.15.

First, f(k) = k * ln(2.5) - (k + 1) * ln(k) - ln(10)

f'(k) = ln(2.5) - ln(k) - 1

At k=0.15:

f(k) ≈ 0.0165

f'(k) = ln(2.5) - ln(0.15) - 1 ≈ 0.9163 - (-1.8971) - 1 ≈ 0.9163 + 1.8971 - 1 ≈ 1.8134

Newton-Raphson update: k1 = k0 - f(k0)/f'(k0) ≈ 0.15 - 0.0165 / 1.8134 ≈ 0.15 - 0.0091 ≈ 0.1409

Wait, but that's going in the opposite direction. Wait, maybe I need to check the derivative again.

Wait, derivative f'(k) = d/dk [k ln(2.5) - (k + 1) ln(k) - ln(10)] = ln(2.5) - ln(k) - 1.

Yes, that's correct. So at k=0.15, f'(0.15) = ln(2.5) - ln(0.15) - 1 ≈ 0.9163 - (-1.8971) - 1 ≈ 0.9163 + 1.8971 - 1 ≈ 1.8134.

Then, the update is k1 = k0 - f(k0)/f'(k0) ≈ 0.15 - (0.0165)/1.8134 ≈ 0.15 - 0.0091 ≈ 0.1409.

Wait, but that's moving to the left, which would decrease k. But at k=0.1409, which is less than 0.15, we saw that f(k) was 0.0234. Wait, that contradicts. Wait, maybe the derivative is positive, so the function is increasing as k increases. Wait, f'(k) is positive? Let's check:

f'(k) = ln(2.5) - ln(k) - 1 ≈ 0.9163 - ln(k) - 1.

At k=0.15, ln(k)=ln(0.15)≈-1.8971, so f'(0.15)=0.9163 - (-1.8971) -1≈0.9163 +1.8971 -1≈1.8134. So positive.

So the function f(k) is increasing as k increases. Therefore, since f(0.15)=0.0165 and f(0.155)=-0.0042, the root is between 0.15 and 0.155. So using Newton-Raphson:

Take k0=0.15, f(k0)=0.0165, f'(k0)=1.8134

k1 = k0 - f(k0)/f'(k0) ≈ 0.15 - 0.0165/1.8134 ≈ 0.15 - 0.0091 ≈ 0.1409

But at k=0.1409, which is less than 0.15, f(k) was 0.0234. Wait, that can't be. Wait, maybe there's a mistake here. If k is decreasing, f(k) is increasing, so f(0.1409) should be higher than f(0.15). But according to our previous calculation, at k=0.153, f(k)≈0.0234. Wait, maybe my initial assumption was wrong. Let's recalculate f(0.1409):

0.1409 * ln(2.5) ≈ 0.1409 * 0.9163 ≈ 0.1293

1.1409 * ln(0.1409) ≈ 1.1409 * (-1.957) ≈ -2.227

Thus, f(0.1409) ≈ 0.1293 - (-2.227) - 2.3026 ≈ 0.1293 + 2.227 - 2.3026 ≈ 2.3563 - 2.3026 ≈ 0.0537

Wait, that's even higher. So maybe the function is increasing as k decreases. Wait, but according to derivative, the function is increasing as k increases. Wait, maybe the function is increasing for k < something and decreasing for k > something? Let's check the derivative again.

f'(k) = ln(2.5) - ln(k) -1

Set derivative to zero: ln(2.5) - ln(k) -1 = 0 => ln(k) = ln(2.5) - 1 ≈ 0.9163 - 1 ≈ -0.0837 => k ≈ e^{-0.0837} ≈ 0.919

So the function f(k) has a critical point at k≈0.919. For k < 0.919, f'(k) = ln(2.5) - ln(k) -1. Since ln(k) is negative for k <1, so -ln(k) is positive. So for k <0.919, f'(k) is positive. For k >0.919, f'(k) becomes negative. Therefore, the function f(k) increases up to k≈0.919 and then decreases beyond that. But since our k is between 0.15 and 0.155, which is much less than 0.919, we are in the region where f(k) is increasing as k increases. Therefore, as k increases from 0.15 to 0.155, f(k) increases from 0.0165 to -0.0042. Wait, but 0.155 is less than 0.919, so according to the derivative, the function is increasing. So how come at k=0.15, f(k)=0.0165, and at k=0.155, f(k)=-0.0042? That would imply that the function is decreasing as k increases, which contradicts the derivative. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the derivative calculation.

Wait, f'(k) = derivative of [k ln(2.5) - (k + 1) ln(k) - ln(10)] with respect to k.

The derivative of k ln(2.5) is ln(2.5). The derivative of -(k +1) ln(k) is - [ln(k) + (k +1)*(1/k)] = -ln(k) - (k +1)/k = -ln(k) -1 -1/k. Then derivative of -ln(10) is 0. So overall:

f'(k) = ln(2.5) - ln(k) -1 -1/k

Wait, I think I missed the term -1/k. So actually, f'(k) = ln(2.5) - ln(k) -1 -1/k.

So earlier, I forgot the -1/k term. That's a mistake. So correct derivative is:

f'(k) = ln(2.5) - ln(k) -1 -1/k

Therefore, at k=0.15:

f'(0.15) = 0.9163 - (-1.8971) -1 -1/0.15 ≈ 0.9163 +1.8971 -1 -6.6667 ≈ (0.9163 +1.8971) - (1 +6.6667) ≈ 2.8134 -7.6667 ≈ -4.8533

So the derivative at k=0.15 is approximately -4.8533. That's negative. Therefore, the function is decreasing as k increases. Therefore, as k increases from 0.15, f(k) decreases. Therefore, the root is between k=0.15 and k=0.155. Since at k=0.15, f(k)=0.0165, and at k=0.155, f(k)=-0.0042. Therefore, we can use linear approximation.

Let’s define two points: (k1, f1) = (0.15, 0.0165) and (k2, f2) = (0.155, -0.0042). We need to find k where f(k)=0.

The slope between these two points is m = (f2 - f1)/(k2 - k1) = (-0.0042 - 0.0165)/(0.155 - 0.15) = (-0.0207)/0.005 = -4.14 per unit k.

We want to find delta such that 0 = f1 + m * delta

So delta = -f1 / m = -0.0165 / (-4.14) ≈ 0.003985

Therefore, the root is at k ≈ 0.15 + 0.003985 ≈ 0.153985

Let’s check k=0.154:

f(0.154) = 0.154*ln(2.5) - (0.154 +1)*ln(0.154) - ln(10)

Compute each term:

0.154 * ln(2.5) ≈ 0.154 * 0.9163 ≈ 0.1409

1.154 * ln(0.154) ≈ 1.154 * (-1.8743) ≈ -2.166

So f(0.154) ≈ 0.1409 - (-2.166) - 2.3026 ≈ 0.1409 + 2.166 - 2.3026 ≈ 2.3069 - 2.3026 ≈ 0.0043

Still positive. Let's try k=0.1545:

f(0.1545) ≈ 0.1545 * ln(2.5) ≈ 0.1545 * 0.9163 ≈ 0.1413

1.1545 * ln(0.1545) ≈ 1.1545 * (-1.8725) ≈ -2.164

So f(0.1545) ≈ 0.1413 - (-2.164) - 2.3026 ≈ 0.1413 + 2.164 - 2.3026 ≈ 2.3053 - 2.3026 ≈ 0.0027

Still positive. Let's try k=0.155:

As before, f(0.155) ≈ -0.0042

So between k=0.1545 and k=0.155, f(k) goes from 0.0027 to -0.0042. So the root is approximately at k=0.1545 + (0 - 0.0027)*(0.155 - 0.1545)/(-0.0042 - 0.0027) ≈ 0.1545 + (-0.0027)*(-0.0005)/(-0.0069) ≈ 0.1545 - (0.00135)/0.0069 ≈ 0.1545 - 0.195 ≈ 0.15255. Wait, that can't be. Wait, perhaps a better way:

Let’s use linear approximation between (0.1545, 0.0027) and (0.155, -0.0042). The difference in f is -0.0042 - 0.0027 = -0.0069 over a difference in k of 0.0005. So the slope is -0.0069 / 0.0005 = -13.8 per unit k.

We need to find delta such that 0.0027 + (-13.8)*delta = 0. So delta = 0.0027 /13.8 ≈ 0.000196.

Therefore, the root is at k ≈ 0.1545 + 0.000196 ≈ 0.154696

Check k=0.1547:

f(k) ≈ 0.1547 * ln(2.5) ≈ 0.1547 * 0.9163 ≈ 0.1415

1.1547 * ln(0.1547) ≈ 1.1547 * (-1.8717) ≈ -2.163

So f(k) ≈ 0.1415 - (-2.163) - 2.3026 ≈ 0.1415 + 2.163 - 2.3026 ≈ 2.3045 - 2.3026 ≈ 0.0019

Still positive. Next, k=0.1548:

f(k) ≈ 0.1548 * 0.9163 ≈ 0.1416

1.1548 * ln(0.1548) ≈ 1.1548 * (-1.8713) ≈ -2.163

f(k) ≈ 0.1416 - (-2.163) - 2.3026 ≈ 0.1416 + 2.163 - 2.3026 ≈ 2.3046 - 2.3026 ≈ 0.002

Wait, this is not converging. Maybe I need a better approach. Alternatively, since we need an approximate value for k, maybe 0.154 is close enough. Let's accept k≈0.154 and proceed.

So, with k≈0.154, then y = 2.5 / k ≈ 2.5 / 0.154 ≈ 16.2338

Then x = y^k ≈ (16.2338)^0.154

Compute 16.2338^0.154. Let's take natural log:

ln(16.2338) ≈ 2.788

Multiply by 0.154: 2.788 * 0.154 ≈ 0.429

So x ≈ e^0.429 ≈ 1.536

Therefore, x≈1.536, y≈16.234. Then xy≈1.536 *16.234≈25

Wait, 1.536 *16 =24.576, 1.536*0.234≈0.359, so total≈24.576+0.359≈24.935≈25

So xy≈25. Let me check if this is consistent with the original equations.

First equation: log_x(y^x)=10

Compute y^x: (16.234)^1.536. Let's compute ln(16.234^1.536) =1.536 * ln(16.234)≈1.536 * 2.788≈4.294

So y^x≈e^4.294≈74.6

Then log_x(74.6)=10. So x^10=74.6. Let's check x=1.536:

1.536^10. Let's compute ln(1.536^10)=10 * ln(1.536)≈10*0.429≈4.29. So e^4.29≈74.6. Which matches. So first equation is satisfied.

Second equation: log_y(x^{4y})=10

Compute x^{4y}=1.536^{4*16.234}=1.536^{64.936}

Take ln: ln(1.536^64.936)=64.936 * ln(1.536)≈64.936 *0.429≈27.77

So x^{4y}=e^{27.77}≈1.25e12

Then log_y(1.25e12)=10. So y^10=1.25e12. Let's check y=16.234:

ln(16.234^10)=10*2.788≈27.88. e^27.88≈1.25e12. Which matches.

Therefore, the approximate solution gives xy≈25. So the answer is 25.

But let me check if there is an exact solution. Let's see.

Suppose xy=25. Then, if xy=25, then x=25/y. Let's substitute into the equations.

First equation: log_x(y^x)=10. Since x=25/y, log_{25/y}(y^{25/y})=10

Using change of base: log_{25/y}(y^{25/y}) = [ln(y^{25/y})]/[ln(25/y)] = [ (25/y) ln y ] / [ln 25 - ln y ] = 10

Multiply both sides by denominator:

(25/y) ln y = 10 [ln 25 - ln y]

Multiply both sides by y:

25 ln y = 10 y [ln 25 - ln y]

Divide both sides by 5:

5 ln y = 2 y [ln 25 - ln y]

Rearrange:

5 ln y = 2 y ln 25 - 2 y ln y

Bring all terms to left:

5 ln y + 2 y ln y - 2 y ln 25 = 0

Factor:

ln y (5 + 2 y) - 2 y ln 25 = 0

Hmm, this seems complicated. Let me try substituting xy=25 into the second equation.

Second equation: log_y(x^{4y})=10. Since x=25/y,

log_y( (25/y)^{4y} ) =10

Which is log_y(25^{4y} / y^{4y}) =10

Using log properties: log_y(25^{4y}) - log_y(y^{4y}) =10

Which is 4y log_y(25) - 4y log_y(y) =10

Simplify:

4y * log_y(25) -4y *1 =10

Since log_y(25)=ln25/lny, so:

4y*(ln25 / lny) -4y =10

Factor 4y:

4y [ ln25 / lny -1 ] =10

Divide both sides by 4:

y [ ln25 / lny -1 ] =2.5

But from the first equation, we had:

5 ln y + 2 y ln y - 2 y ln25 =0

Which can be written as:

(5 + 2 y) ln y = 2 y ln25

Therefore:

(5 + 2y) lny =2 y ln25

Let me write both equations:

From first equation:

(5 + 2y) lny =2 y ln25

From second equation:

y [ ln25 / lny -1 ] =2.5

Let me substitute from first equation into the second. From first equation:

(5 + 2y) lny =2 y ln25 => lny = (2 y ln25)/(5 +2y)

Plug into second equation:

y [ ln25 / ( (2 y ln25)/(5 +2y) ) -1 ] =2.5

Simplify inside the brackets:

ln25 / ( (2 y ln25)/(5 +2y) ) = (5 +2y)/ (2 y)

So:

y [ (5 +2y)/(2 y) -1 ] =2.5

Simplify inside:

(5 +2y)/(2 y) -1 = (5 +2y -2y)/2y =5/(2y)

Therefore, equation becomes:

y * [5/(2y)] =2.5 => (5/2) =2.5

Which is 2.5=2.5. So this is an identity. Therefore, the two equations are dependent when xy=25. Therefore, xy=25 is the solution.

Therefore, the answer is \boxed{25}
Therefore, the product \(xy\) is \(\boxed{25}\).
