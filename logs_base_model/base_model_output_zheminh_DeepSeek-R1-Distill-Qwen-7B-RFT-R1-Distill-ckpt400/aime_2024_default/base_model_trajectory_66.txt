Okay, so I need to find the radius squared of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box with surface area 54 and volume 23. Then, express that squared radius as a fraction p/q and find p + q. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem.

First, the problem is about a set of rectangular boxes (so each box has length, width, and height) with given surface area and volume. The surface area is 54, and the volume is 23. We need to find the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes. The radius of that sphere will be the maximum distance from the center of the sphere to any corner of the box. Since the sphere must contain the entire box, the sphere's radius must be at least half the space diagonal of the box. Therefore, the minimal sphere's radius is half the maximum space diagonal among all such boxes. Hence, r is half the maximum space diagonal, so r² is (maximum space diagonal)² divided by 4. Therefore, to find r², we need to maximize the space diagonal of the boxes in set B, then divide by 4.

So, the key steps are:

1. For a rectangular box with given surface area (SA) and volume (V), express the space diagonal in terms of the dimensions.
2. Find the maximum possible space diagonal for such boxes.
3. Compute r² = (max space diagonal)² / 4.
4. Express this as a reduced fraction and find p + q.

Let me recall that the space diagonal d of a rectangular box with sides a, b, c is given by:

d = √(a² + b² + c²)

So, d² = a² + b² + c². Therefore, we need to maximize a² + b² + c² given that the surface area is 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54 and the volume is abc = 23.

Therefore, the problem reduces to maximizing a² + b² + c² subject to the constraints:

ab + bc + ac = 27 (since 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54, so dividing by 2 gives 27)
abc = 23

So, we need to maximize a² + b² + c² with these constraints.

Hmm, this seems like an optimization problem with constraints. Maybe I can use Lagrange multipliers here. Let's set up the function to maximize:

f(a, b, c) = a² + b² + c²

Subject to the constraints:

g(a, b, c) = ab + bc + ac - 27 = 0

h(a, b, c) = abc - 23 = 0

So, we need to find the extrema of f subject to both g and h being zero. Since there are two constraints, we'll use Lagrange multipliers with two multipliers.

The Lagrangian would be:

L = a² + b² + c² - λ(ab + bc + ac - 27) - μ(abc - 23)

Then, we take partial derivatives with respect to a, b, c, λ, μ and set them to zero.

Compute the partial derivatives:

∂L/∂a = 2a - λ(b + c) - μ(bc) = 0

∂L/∂b = 2b - λ(a + c) - μ(ac) = 0

∂L/∂c = 2c - λ(a + b) - μ(ab) = 0

∂L/∂λ = -(ab + bc + ac - 27) = 0

∂L/∂μ = -(abc - 23) = 0

So, we have the system of equations:

1. 2a - λ(b + c) - μ(bc) = 0

2. 2b - λ(a + c) - μ(ac) = 0

3. 2c - λ(a + b) - μ(ab) = 0

4. ab + bc + ac = 27

5. abc = 23

This seems quite complex. Let me see if there's symmetry here. If we assume that a = b = c, then the problem would be simpler, but let's check if such a cube exists. If a = b = c, then the surface area would be 6a² = 54, so a² = 9, a = 3. Then the volume would be a³ = 27, but we need volume 23, which is less. So, a cube with edge length 3 has surface area 54 and volume 27, which is too big. So, the minimal sphere for that cube would have radius √(3² + 3² + 3²)/2 = √27/2 = 3√3/2, so r² = 27/4. But since 27/4 is 6.75, but our volume is 23 which is less, so maybe the maximum space diagonal occurs for a non-cube box?

Alternatively, maybe the maximum space diagonal occurs when two sides are equal, or when one side is different. Let's consider the case where two variables are equal. Let's assume a = b ≠ c. Then, maybe we can reduce the problem to two variables.

Let me try that. Let a = b, then:

From the constraints:

ab + bc + ac = a² + 2ac = 27

abc = a²c = 23

So, let's let a = b, then:

From the second equation: a²c = 23 => c = 23/a²

Plug into the first equation: a² + 2a*(23/a²) = 27 => a² + 46/a = 27

Multiply both sides by a: a³ + 46 = 27a => a³ - 27a + 46 = 0

Let me solve this cubic equation: a³ -27a +46 = 0

Try rational roots. Possible roots are factors of 46 over 1: ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Test a=1: 1 -27 +46 = 20 ≠0

a=2: 8 -54 +46=0 → 8 -54 is -46, -46 +46=0. So a=2 is a root.

So, factor out (a -2):

Using polynomial division or synthetic division:

Divide a³ -27a +46 by (a -2):

Coefficients: 1 (a³), 0 (a²), -27 (a), 46 (constant)

Bring down 1. Multiply by 2: 2. Add to next coefficient: 0 +2=2.

Multiply by 2: 4. Add to next coefficient: -27 +4= -23.

Multiply by 2: -46. Add to last coefficient: 46 + (-46)=0. So, quotient is a² +2a -23.

Thus, the equation factors as (a -2)(a² +2a -23)=0.

Therefore, roots are a=2, and a² +2a -23=0. Solve the quadratic:

a = [-2 ±√(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 ±√96]/2 = [-2 ±4√6]/2 = -1 ±2√6.

Since a must be positive, a= -1 +2√6 ≈ -1 +4.898≈3.898.

But let's check if a=2 is feasible. If a=2, then c=23/(2²)=23/4=5.75. Then, check ab + bc + ac = a² +2ac =4 +2*(2*5.75)=4 +23=27. Yes, that works. So, the box has sides 2, 2, and 5.75. Then, the space diagonal is √(2² +2² +5.75²)=√(4 +4 +33.0625)=√(41.0625)=6.41. Then, r² would be (6.41/2)²≈(3.205)²≈10.276. But let's compute the exact value.

Wait, let's compute exact values. If a=2, c=23/4. Then, a² +b² +c²= 2² +2² + (23/4)²=4 +4 +529/16=8 +33.0625=41.0625. So, d²=41.0625. Then, r²=41.0625/4=10.265625. Which is 657/64. Wait, 41.0625 is 41 + 1/16= (41*16 +1)/16=657/16. Then, 657/16 divided by 4 is 657/64. So, 657/64 is the r² for this case. But is this the maximum?

Alternatively, let's check the other root: a= -1 +2√6≈3.898. Then, c=23/a². Let's compute a²: (-1 +2√6)^2=1 -4√6 +24=25 -4√6. Then, c=23/(25 -4√6). Rationalize denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4√6):

c=23*(25 +4√6)/[(25)^2 - (4√6)^2]=23*(25 +4√6)/(625 - 16*6)=23*(25 +4√6)/(625 -96)=23*(25 +4√6)/529.

Simplify 23/529=1/23, so c=(25 +4√6)/23.

Then, a= -1 +2√6, b=a, c=(25 +4√6)/23.

Compute a² +b² +c²=2a² +c².

First, a²=25 -4√6 as above.

So, 2a²=50 -8√6.

c²= [(25 +4√6)/23]^2= (625 + 200√6 + 16*6)/529= (625 + 200√6 +96)/529= (721 +200√6)/529.

Therefore, total a² +b² +c²=50 -8√6 + (721 +200√6)/529.

Convert 50 to 50*529/529=26450/529.

Similarly, -8√6= -8√6*529/529= -4232√6/529.

So, total:

(26450 -4232√6 +721 +200√6)/529= (26450 +721) + (-4232√6 +200√6)/529=27171 -4032√6)/529.

Simplify numerator:

27171 -4032√6. So, the space diagonal squared is (27171 -4032√6)/529. Then, r² would be half of that, so (27171 -4032√6)/(529*4)= (27171 -4032√6)/2116.

But this seems complicated. Let's approximate the value numerically to see if it's larger than the previous case. The previous case had r²≈10.2656. Let's compute this case:

First, compute a= -1 +2√6≈-1 +4.898≈3.898. Then, c≈(25 +4√6)/23≈(25 +9.798)/23≈34.798/23≈1.513. Then, a≈3.898, b≈3.898, c≈1.513.

Compute a² +b² +c²≈3.898² +3.898² +1.513²≈15.192 +15.192 +2.289≈32.673. Then, r²≈32.673/4≈8.168. Which is less than the previous case. Therefore, the maximum space diagonal occurs when two sides are equal to 2 and the third is 5.75, giving r²≈10.2656.

But wait, maybe there's a case where all three sides are different? Let's see. Suppose none of the variables are equal. Then, the system of equations from the Lagrangian multipliers would need to be solved. But that might be complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps using the method of Lagrange multipliers without assuming symmetry. Let me try to solve the system of equations.

We have:

1. 2a - λ(b + c) - μ(bc) = 0

2. 2b - λ(a + c) - μ(ac) = 0

3. 2c - λ(a + b) - μ(ab) = 0

Let me subtract equation 1 from equation 2:

(2b - λ(a + c) - μ(ac)) - (2a - λ(b + c) - μ(bc)) = 0

Simplify:

2b -2a -λ(a + c - b - c) - μ(ac - bc) = 0

2(b - a) -λ(a - b) - μ(c(a - b)) = 0

Factor out (b - a):

[2 + λ + μc](b - a) = 0

Similarly, subtract equation 2 from equation 3:

(2c - λ(a + b) - μ(ab)) - (2b - λ(a + c) - μ(ac)) = 0

Simplify:

2c -2b -λ(a + b - a - c) - μ(ab - ac) =0

2(c - b) -λ(b - c) - μ(a(b - c)) =0

Factor out (c - b):

[2 + λ + μa](c - b) =0

So, from the first subtraction: [2 + λ + μc](b - a) =0

From the second subtraction: [2 + λ + μa](c - b)=0

Similarly, subtracting equation 1 from equation 3:

[2 + λ + μb](c - a) =0

Wait, let me check. Let me subtract equation 1 from equation 3:

(2c - λ(a + b) - μ(ab)) - (2a - λ(b + c) - μ(bc)) =0

Simplify:

2c -2a -λ(a + b - b - c) - μ(ab - bc)=0

2(c - a) -λ(a -c) - μ(b(a - c))=0

Factor out (c - a):

[2 + λ + μb](c - a) =0

Therefore, we have three equations:

1. [2 + λ + μc](b - a) =0

2. [2 + λ + μa](c - b)=0

3. [2 + λ + μb](c - a)=0

Assuming that none of the variables are equal (i.e., a ≠ b ≠ c), then the terms in the brackets must be zero.

Therefore:

2 + λ + μc =0

2 + λ + μa =0

2 + λ + μb =0

But then, from first and second equations:

2 + λ + μc = 2 + λ + μa => μc = μa => If μ ≠0, then c = a.

Similarly, from second and third equations: 2 + λ + μa =2 + λ + μb => μa = μb => If μ ≠0, then a = b.

But that contradicts our assumption that a ≠ b ≠ c. Therefore, either μ=0 or all variables are equal. If μ=0, then equations become:

2 + λ =0

But then from equation 1: 2 + λ + μc =0 => 2 + λ =0. Similarly, equations 2 and 3 also become 2 + λ=0. So, λ= -2. Then, from the original equations:

From equation 1: 2a - (-2)(b + c) -0=0 => 2a +2(b +c)=0 => a + b +c=0. But since a, b, c are lengths, they must be positive. Therefore, this is impossible. Hence, the only solution is when a = b = c. But earlier, we saw that a cube with sides 3 has surface area 54 and volume 27, which is too big. However, in our problem, the volume is 23, which is less. Therefore, the minimal sphere's radius would be for a cube with volume 23, but since we cannot have such a sphere (as the problem states that the set B includes all boxes with SA=54 and V=23), but since a cube with volume 23 would have surface area 54? Wait, no, a cube with volume 23 would have side length (23)^(1/3), surface area 6*(23)^(2/3). Let's compute that:

(23)^(1/3) ≈2.84, so surface area≈6*(2.84)^2≈6*8.06≈48.36, which is less than 54. Therefore, the cube with volume 23 has surface area less than 54. Therefore, there must be other boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23 that are not cubes. Hence, the maximum space diagonal must be achieved by one of these non-cube boxes.

But from the previous attempt, when two sides are equal (a = b), the space diagonal squared was 41.0625, giving r²≈10.2656. But when all sides are different, the space diagonal squared was lower. Therefore, perhaps the maximum is indeed when two sides are equal. But maybe there's another case. Let's check.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum space diagonal occurs when one of the variables is as large as possible, while the other two are as small as possible. But given that the product abc=23, to have one variable large, the other two must be small. However, the surface area constraint ab + bc + ac=27 must also be satisfied. Let's see.

Suppose c is very large, then ab must be small to satisfy ab + bc + ac=27. But since abc=23, if c is large, then ab=23/c must be small. However, ab + bc + ac=27. If c is large, then bc and ac would be large as well, unless a and b are zero, which is impossible. Therefore, there's a balance here. Let's try to see if we can have two variables small and one large.

Let me assume that a approaches zero. Then, from abc=23, if a approaches zero, b or c must approach infinity. However, the surface area ab + bc + ac=27. If a approaches zero, then ab and ac approach zero, so bc approaches 27. But then, abc=23 => b*c*a=23. If a approaches zero, then b*c approaches infinity, but 23/a approaches infinity. But bc=27 -ab -ac≈27. So, bc≈27. Then, abc≈27a=23. So, a≈23/27≈0.85. Therefore, a cannot approach zero. Therefore, there's a lower bound on the size of a, b, c.

Alternatively, maybe the maximum space diagonal occurs when two variables are as unequal as possible. Let's consider setting one variable to be as large as possible, but given the constraints.

Alternatively, maybe the maximum occurs when one variable is larger than the cube root of 23, and the other two are smaller. Let me test with a specific example.

Suppose a=10, then from abc=23, bc=23/10=2.3. Then, from ab + bc + ac=27, 10b +2.3 +10c=27. But bc=2.3, so c=2.3/b. Substitute:

10b +2.3 +10*(2.3/b)=27

10b +2.3 +23/b=27

Multiply both sides by b:

10b² +2.3b +23=27b

10b² -24.7b +23=0

Solve quadratic equation:

b=(24.7 ±√(24.7² -4*10*23))/(2*10)

Compute discriminant:

24.7²=610.09

4*10*23=920

Discriminant=610.09 -920= -309.91

Negative discriminant, so no real solution. Therefore, a cannot be 10.

Similarly, try a=5. Then bc=23/5=4.6. Then ab + bc + ac=5b +5c +4.6=27. So, 5b +5c=22.4 => b +c=4.48. Also, bc=4.6. Therefore, we can solve for b and c:

b +c=4.48

bc=4.6

So, the quadratic equation is x² -4.48x +4.6=0

Discriminant=4.48² -4*4.6=20.0704 -18.4=1.6704

Solutions: x=(4.48 ±√1.6704)/2≈(4.48 ±1.292)/2

So, x≈(4.48 +1.292)/2≈5.772/2≈2.886 or x≈(4.48 -1.292)/2≈3.188/2≈1.594

Therefore, b≈2.886, c≈1.594. Then, check the surface area: ab + bc + ac=5*2.886 +5*1.594 +2.886*1.594≈14.43 +7.97 +4.63≈27.03, which is approximately 27. So, this is a valid solution. Then, compute the space diagonal squared: a² +b² +c²=25 + (2.886)² + (1.594)²≈25 +8.33 +2.54≈35.87. Then, r²≈35.87/4≈8.967. Which is less than the previous case where r²≈10.2656. Therefore, even with a=5, the space diagonal is smaller than when two sides are equal to 2.

Therefore, this suggests that the maximum space diagonal occurs when two sides are equal to 2, and the third is 5.75, giving r²=657/64≈10.2656. But let's check another case.

Suppose a=1, then bc=23. From ab + bc + ac=27, 1*b +23 +1*c=27 =>b +c=4. Then, bc=23, so b +c=4 and bc=23. Then, quadratic equation x² -4x +23=0. Discriminant=16 -92= -76, no real solution. Therefore, a cannot be 1.

Another case: a=4. Then bc=23/4=5.75. From ab + bc + ac=27:4b +5.75 +4c=27 =>4(b +c)=21.25 =>b +c=5.3125. Then, bc=5.75. So, quadratic equation x² -5.3125x +5.75=0. Discriminant=5.3125² -4*5.75≈28.23 -23≈5.23. Solutions: (5.3125 ±√5.23)/2≈(5.3125 ±2.287)/2. So, x≈(5.3125 +2.287)/2≈7.5995/2≈3.7997 or x≈(5.3125 -2.287)/2≈3.0255/2≈1.5127. Then, compute a² +b² +c²=16 + (3.7997)^2 + (1.5127)^2≈16 +14.43 +2.29≈32.72. Then, r²≈32.72/4≈8.18, which is again less than 10.2656.

Hmm, so all other cases where a ≠ b ≠ c give a smaller space diagonal squared than the case where two sides are 2 and the third is 5.75. Therefore, it seems that the maximum is achieved when two sides are equal to 2, and the third is 5.75. Therefore, r²= (4 +4 +33.0625)/4=41.0625/4=10.265625=657/64. Therefore, p=657, q=64. They are coprime? Let's check gcd(657,64). 657 divided by 64 is 10*64=640, remainder 17. Then, gcd(64,17). 64=3*17 +13; gcd(17,13); 17=1*13 +4; gcd(13,4); 13=3*4 +1; gcd(4,1)=1. So yes, gcd is 1. Therefore, 657/64 is reduced. Therefore, p+q=657+64=721.

But wait, hold on. The problem says "the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of 𝓑". So, if the maximum space diagonal among all boxes in B is d, then the minimal enclosing sphere has radius d/2. Therefore, r = d/2. But is this really the case?

Wait, actually, for any rectangular box, the minimal enclosing sphere is determined by the space diagonal. However, if the box can be rotated inside the sphere, maybe a different orientation could result in a smaller sphere. But in reality, the minimal enclosing sphere for a rectangular box is indeed the one where the space diagonal is the diameter. Because any rotation that would make a space diagonal fit into the sphere would still require the space diagonal to be the diameter. Therefore, the minimal enclosing sphere must have diameter equal to the space diagonal. Therefore, r = d/2, so r² = d²/4.

Therefore, if the maximum space diagonal is  sqrt(41.0625)=6.41, then r²=6.41²/4≈41.0625/4≈10.2656, which is 657/64. Therefore, the answer is 657 +64=721.

But let me just confirm if there exists a box in the set B where the space diagonal is indeed larger than when a=b=2 and c=5.75. Suppose we take another case where a and b are different from 2, but maybe one is larger and the other is smaller. Let's try a=3, then bc=23/3≈7.6667. Then, ab + bc + ac=3b +7.6667 +3c=27 =>3(b +c)=19.3333 =>b +c≈6.4444. Then, bc≈7.6667. So, quadratic equation x² -6.4444x +7.6667=0. Discriminant≈(6.4444)^2 -4*7.6667≈41.511 -30.6668≈10.844. Solutions≈(6.4444 ±√10.844)/2≈(6.4444 ±3.293)/2. So, x≈(6.4444 +3.293)/2≈9.737/2≈4.868 or x≈(6.4444 -3.293)/2≈3.151/2≈1.575. Then, compute a² +b² +c²≈9 +4.868² +1.575²≈9 +23.69 +2.48≈35.17. Then, r²≈35.17/4≈8.79, which is still less than 10.2656.

Alternatively, take a=1.5, then bc=23/1.5≈15.3333. Then, ab + bc + ac=1.5b +15.3333 +1.5c=27 =>1.5(b +c)=11.6667 =>b +c≈7.7778. Then, bc≈15.3333. So, quadratic equation x² -7.7778x +15.3333=0. Discriminant≈60.51 -61.333≈-0.823. No real solution. Therefore, a=1.5 is invalid.

Alternatively, take a=2.5, then bc=23/2.5=9.2. Then, ab + bc + ac=2.5b +9.2 +2.5c=27 =>2.5(b +c)=17.8 =>b +c=7.12. Then, bc=9.2. Quadratic equation x² -7.12x +9.2=0. Discriminant≈50.69 -36.8=13.89. Solutions≈(7.12 ±3.68)/2. So, x≈(7.12 +3.68)/2≈10.8/2≈5.4 or x≈(7.12 -3.68)/2≈3.44/2≈1.72. Then, compute a² +b² +c²≈6.25 +5.4² +1.72²≈6.25 +29.16 +2.96≈38.37. Then, r²≈38.37/4≈9.59, which is still less than 10.2656.

Therefore, from all these cases, the maximum space diagonal squared is achieved when two sides are 2 and the third is 5.75, leading to r²=657/64, so p+q=657+64=721.

Thus, the answer is 721.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{721}
Therefore, the value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{657}{64}$, where $p = 657$ and $q = 64$. Therefore, $p+q = 657 + 64 = \boxed{721}$.
