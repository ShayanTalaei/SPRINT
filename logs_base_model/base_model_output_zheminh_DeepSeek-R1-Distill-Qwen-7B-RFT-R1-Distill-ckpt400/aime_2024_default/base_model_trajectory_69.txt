Okay, let's see. Jen is playing a lottery where she picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are selected. We need to find the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she already won a prize. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm. So this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). Here, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning at least two numbers. So we need to compute the probability of winning the grand prize divided by the probability of winning at least two numbers.

First, let's figure out the total number of possible lottery draws. Since 4 numbers are chosen from 10, the total number of possible combinations is C(10,4). Let me compute that. C(10,4) is 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So there are 210 possible ways the lottery numbers can be drawn.

Now, Jen picks her 4 numbers. Let's denote her set of numbers as J. The probability that she wins the grand prize is the probability that J is exactly the same as the lottery numbers. Since there's only one such combination, the probability is 1/210.

But we need the conditional probability. So we need to find the probability that J is exactly the lottery numbers (A), given that at least two of her numbers are in the lottery numbers (B). So P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B). But since if A happens, then B must happen (because if all four numbers are the same, then all four are in the lottery numbers, which is more than two), so P(A and B) is just P(A). Therefore, P(A|B) = (1/210) / P(B).

So now we need to compute P(B), the probability that at least two of Jen's numbers are in the lottery numbers. To compute this, we can calculate 1 minus the probability that fewer than two of her numbers are in the lottery numbers. That is, 1 - [P(0 numbers matching) + P(1 number matching)].

Alternatively, we can compute P(B) directly by considering the cases where exactly 2, 3, or 4 numbers match. Let's try both approaches and see which is easier.

First, the direct approach: P(B) = P(exactly 2) + P(exactly 3) + P(exactly 4). The probability of exactly k matches is C(4,k) * C(6,4-k) / C(10,4). Let me explain. For exactly k numbers matching, we choose k numbers from Jen's 4, and the remaining 4 - k numbers from the 6 numbers not in Jen's set. So the number of favorable combinations is C(4,k) * C(6,4 - k). Hence, P(B) = [C(4,2)*C(6,2) + C(4,3)*C(6,1) + C(4,4)*C(6,0)] / C(10,4).

Let me compute each term:

C(4,2) = 6, C(6,2) = 15. So first term is 6*15 = 90.

C(4,3) = 4, C(6,1) = 6. So second term is 4*6 = 24.

C(4,4) = 1, C(6,0) = 1. So third term is 1*1 = 1.

Adding these together: 90 + 24 + 1 = 115. Then divide by 210. So P(B) = 115/210. Let's check if this reduces. 115 and 210 share a common factor of 5: 115 ÷ 5 = 23, 210 ÷ 5 = 42. So 23/42. Wait, but 115/210 = 23/42. Wait, 115 divided by 5 is 23, 210 divided by 5 is 42. So yes, 23/42. But let me verify that. Wait, 23*5=115, 42*5=210. So yes. So P(B) = 23/42.

Alternatively, using the complementary approach: P(B) = 1 - [P(0 matches) + P(1 match)]. Let's compute that. P(0 matches) is C(4,0)*C(6,4)/C(10,4). Which is 1 * 15 / 210 = 15/210. P(1 match) is C(4,1)*C(6,3)/C(10,4). C(4,1)=4, C(6,3)=20. So 4*20=80. 80/210. So total P(0 or 1) = (15 + 80)/210 = 95/210. Therefore, P(B) = 1 - 95/210 = 115/210 = 23/42. Same result. Good.

Therefore, the conditional probability P(A|B) is (1/210) divided by (23/42). Let's compute that. (1/210) / (23/42) = (1/210) * (42/23) = (42)/(210*23) = (42)/(4830). Simplify this fraction. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 42: 42 ÷ 42 = 1, 4830 ÷42 = 115. So 1/115. Wait, but 1/115? Wait, that seems low. Let me check again.

Wait, 42/4830: 4830 ÷ 42. Let's compute 42*100=4200, 4830-4200=630. 42*15=630. So 42*115=4830. So 42/4830 = 1/115. So yes, 1/115. So the probability is 1/115. Therefore, m=1, n=115. They are coprime. So m + n = 116.

Wait, but let me double-check everything to be sure. First, total combinations C(10,4)=210, correct. The number of winning combinations for the grand prize is 1. The probability of winning the grand prize is 1/210. Then, the probability of winning at least two numbers is 23/42. Therefore, conditional probability is (1/210)/(23/42) = (1/210)*(42/23) = (42)/(210*23) = (42)/(4830) = 1/115. Yep, that's correct. So the answer is 1/115, so m + n = 1 + 115 = 116.

But wait, let me confirm once more. Suppose Jen picks 4 numbers. The total possible lottery draws are 210. The number of lottery draws that have at least two numbers in common with Jen's set is 115. So the conditional probability that the lottery numbers are exactly Jen's set (1 case) given that there are 115 possible lottery numbers that have at least two matches with Jen's numbers. Therefore, the probability is 1/115. That seems correct.

Alternatively, think of it as given that there are at least two matches, how likely is it that all four matches. Since there's only one such case, the probability is 1 divided by the number of cases with at least two matches. But the number of such cases is 115. Therefore, 1/115. Yep, that's another way to see it. So the answer is 1/115, so m + n is 116.

I think that's solid. Let me just check if there's any possible mistake in the calculations. Let's recount the number of combinations with exactly 2, 3, 4 numbers matching.

For exactly 2: C(4,2)*C(6,2) = 6*15=90.

Exactly 3: C(4,3)*C(6,1)=4*6=24.

Exactly 4: 1*1=1.

Total: 90+24+1=115. Correct. So yes, 115. Then 115/210 simplifies to 23/42. Then 1/210 divided by 23/42 is 1/210 * 42/23 = (42)/(210*23) = (1)/(5*23) = 1/115. Correct. So m=1, n=115. So answer is 116.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{116}
Therefore, the probability of Jen winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\frac{1}{115}$, and $m + n = 1 + 115 = \boxed{116}$.
