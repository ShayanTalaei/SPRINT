Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem step by step. The problem states that in triangle ABC, the circumradius R is 13, the inradius r is 6, and the line IA is perpendicular to OI, where O is the circumcenter and I is the incenter. We need to find the product AB · AC. 

First, I need to recall some properties and formulas related to triangles, circumradius, inradius, and the positions of the circumcenter and incenter. Since the problem involves both the circumradius and inradius, as well as the distances between the incenter and circumcenter, I should probably start by writing down the known formulas that relate these quantities.

I remember that the distance between the incenter (I) and circumcenter (O) in a triangle can be calculated using the formula:

OI² = R(R - 2r)

Where R is the circumradius, and r is the inradius. Let me verify this formula. Yes, Euler's formula in triangle geometry states that the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is sqrt(R(R - 2r)). So, OI = sqrt(R(R - 2r)). Plugging in the given values R = 13 and r = 6, we get:

OI² = 13(13 - 2*6) = 13(13 - 12) = 13*1 = 13

Therefore, OI = sqrt(13). 

But in the problem, it's given that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, IA ⊥ OI. That seems important. Let me think about how this condition can be used. 

The incenter I is the intersection of the angle bisectors, and the circumcenter O is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, maybe there's a right triangle involved here. Let me try to visualize or draw a diagram. 

In triangle ABC, O is the circumcenter, I is the incenter. From I, we draw IA, which is perpendicular to OI. So, triangle AIO has a right angle at A? Wait, no. IA is perpendicular to OI. So, OI is a line segment from O to I, and IA is another line segment from I to A, and they are perpendicular. So, point A is somewhere such that when you connect I to A, that segment is perpendicular to OI. 

Hmm, perhaps we can use coordinates to model this situation. Let me consider setting up a coordinate system where O is at the origin. Since O is the circumcenter, all vertices of the triangle are at a distance of 13 from O. The incenter I is at some point (x, y) such that the distance from O to I is sqrt(13). Then, the line OI has a certain slope, and IA is perpendicular to that, so IA has a slope that's the negative reciprocal of OI's slope.

But maybe before jumping into coordinates, I can recall other formulas or relations that might help here. For example, there's a formula for the length of IA. The length of the inradius to vertex A can be expressed in terms of the inradius r, the semiperimeter, and other triangle quantities. Wait, the formula for the distance from the inradius to a vertex is IA = sqrt(r^2 + (s - a)^2), where s is the semiperimeter and a is the side opposite vertex A. But I need to verify that.

Alternatively, there's a formula for the distance from the incenter to vertex A, which is given by:

IA = \frac{r}{\sin \frac{A}{2}}

But I need to check if that's correct. Let me recall that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the inradius and the angles. Since the inradius is the distance from the incenter to each side, and the incenter makes angles with the vertices. Wait, maybe it's better to use trigonometric relations.

Alternatively, in triangle AIO, since IA is perpendicular to OI, triangle AIO is a right-angled triangle at A. Wait, but IA is perpendicular to OI, so the right angle is at I, not at A. Wait, let's clarify. If IA is perpendicular to OI, then the angle between IA and OI is 90 degrees. So, in triangle AIO, the angle at I is 90 degrees. Therefore, triangle AIO is right-angled at I.

Yes, that's correct. So, triangle AIO is a right triangle with right angle at I. Therefore, by the Pythagorean theorem:

AO² = AI² + OI²

But AO is the circumradius, which is 13. OI is sqrt(13) as we calculated earlier. Therefore:

13² = AI² + (sqrt(13))²

169 = AI² + 13

Therefore, AI² = 169 - 13 = 156

So, AI = sqrt(156) = sqrt(4*39) = 2*sqrt(39)

Therefore, we have found that AI = 2*sqrt(39).

But how does this help us find AB · AC? Let's see. The length AI is related to other elements of the triangle. I recall that the distance from the incenter to vertex A can be expressed in terms of the inradius r and the angle at A. Specifically, there is a formula:

AI = \frac{r}{\sin \frac{A}{2}}

Which comes from the fact that in the inradius, the distance from the incenter to vertex A is equal to the inradius divided by the sine of half the angle at A. Let me verify this.

Yes, in triangle AIO, the angle at I is 90 degrees, and the angle at A is half of angle A of triangle ABC. Wait, not exactly. Let's think. In triangle ABC, the incenter I is located such that angle OAI is equal to half of angle A, because the incenter lies at the intersection of angle bisectors. Therefore, in triangle AIO, angle at A is angle OAI = A/2, angle at I is 90 degrees, and angle at O is the remaining angle. 

Therefore, in triangle AIO, we have:

sin(angle at A) = opposite side / hypotenuse

But wait, in triangle AIO, angle at A is A/2, the side opposite to angle A/2 is OI, and the hypotenuse is AO. Wait, no. Let's clarify. 

In triangle AIO:

- The right angle is at I.

- Therefore, angle at I is 90 degrees.

- The other angles are at A and O.

- Angle at A is angle OAI = A/2 (since the incenter lies on the angle bisector).

- Therefore, angle at O is 90 - A/2.

Therefore, in triangle AIO:

sin(angle at A) = opposite side / hypotenuse

But angle at A is A/2, the side opposite to angle A/2 is OI, and the hypotenuse is AO.

Thus:

sin(A/2) = OI / AO

Therefore:

OI = AO * sin(A/2)

But we already know OI = sqrt(13) and AO = 13. Therefore:

sqrt(13) = 13 * sin(A/2)

Divide both sides by 13:

sin(A/2) = sqrt(13)/13 = 1/sqrt(13)

Therefore:

A/2 = arcsin(1/sqrt(13))

So, angle A is 2 * arcsin(1/sqrt(13))

Hmm, that's an interesting angle. Let me compute sin(A/2) = 1/sqrt(13), so cos(A/2) = sqrt(1 - (1/13)) = sqrt(12/13) = 2*sqrt(39)/13. Wait, not sure if that's correct. Wait, sin(A/2) = 1/sqrt(13), so cos(A/2) = sqrt(1 - (1/13)) = sqrt(12/13) = 2*sqrt(3)/sqrt(13). Wait, sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3), so sqrt(12/13) is 2*sqrt(3)/sqrt(13). Therefore, cos(A/2) = 2*sqrt(3)/sqrt(13). 

But maybe we don't need the exact measure of angle A, but rather some trigonometric identities involving angle A. Let's recall that the area of the triangle can be expressed in terms of the inradius and semiperimeter, or in terms of the sides and angles. Also, the product AB · AC is related to the sides of the triangle.

Let me recall that in triangle ABC, the product AB · AC can be expressed in terms of the sides and angles. If we let AB = c, AC = b, and BC = a, then by the Law of Cosines, we can relate the sides. But maybe we can use some trigonometric identities involving the angles.

Alternatively, since we know the circumradius R = 13, we can relate the sides to the angles using the formula a = 2R sin A, b = 2R sin B, c = 2R sin C. Wait, is that correct? Let me check. 

Yes, in any triangle, the Law of Sines states that a/sin A = 2R, so a = 2R sin A, similarly for the other sides. Therefore, sides are proportional to the sines of their opposite angles.

So, AB = c = 2R sin C, AC = b = 2R sin B, BC = a = 2R sin A.

But we need AB · AC, which would be (2R sin C)(2R sin B) = 4R² sin B sin C.

But R is 13, so 4*13² sin B sin C = 4*169 sin B sin C = 676 sin B sin C.

Therefore, if we can find sin B sin C, we can compute AB · AC.

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to express AB · AC. Let's recall that in triangle ABC, the area is given by (1/2)ab sin C, but I'm not sure if that's directly helpful here.

Alternatively, since we have the inradius r = 6, the area of the triangle can also be expressed as r*s, where s is the semiperimeter. So, area = r*s = 6s.

But the area can also be expressed as (a*b*c)/(4R), using the formula involving the circumradius. So, area = (a*b*c)/(4R) = (a*b*c)/(4*13) = (a*b*c)/52.

Therefore, equating the two expressions for area:

6s = (a*b*c)/52

Therefore, a*b*c = 6*52*s = 312s.

But I don't know if that helps directly. Let's see.

Alternatively, we can use the formula involving the inradius and the semiperimeter. The semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2, and the area is also equal to sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)]. But this might not be directly helpful.

Alternatively, since we have expressions involving sin(A/2) and angle A, maybe we can find the angles B and C in terms of angle A, and then use trigonometric identities to find sin B sin C.

Wait, in triangle ABC, the sum of angles is π radians (180 degrees), so A + B + C = π. Therefore, B + C = π - A.

Therefore, sin B sin C can be expressed using the identity:

sin B sin C = [cos(B - C) - cos(B + C)] / 2

But since B + C = π - A, this becomes:

[cos(B - C) - cos(π - A)] / 2

And cos(π - A) = -cos A, so:

[cos(B - C) + cos A] / 2

Therefore, sin B sin C = [cos(B - C) + cos A]/2

But unless we know something about B - C, this might not help directly. Alternatively, maybe we can use another identity.

Alternatively, we can use the formula for the product sin B sin C in terms of the sides. Wait, from the Law of Sines, sin B = b/(2R), sin C = c/(2R). Therefore, sin B sin C = (b c)/(4 R²). Therefore, AB · AC = b c = 4 R² sin B sin C. Wait, that's exactly what we had before.

But since we need AB · AC = 4 R² sin B sin C, and R = 13, so 4*169 sin B sin C = 676 sin B sin C. So, if we can find sin B sin C, we can compute the desired product.

Alternatively, maybe we can find angle A first. We already have sin(A/2) = 1/sqrt(13). Therefore, angle A/2 = arcsin(1/sqrt(13)).

Therefore, angle A = 2 arcsin(1/sqrt(13)). Let's compute cos A using the double-angle formula. 

cos A = 1 - 2 sin²(A/2) = 1 - 2*(1/13) = 1 - 2/13 = 11/13

Therefore, cos A = 11/13.

Now, since angle A + angle B + angle C = π, we have angle B + angle C = π - A. Therefore, angle B + angle C = π - arccos(11/13). Let me compute angle B + angle C. Since cos A = 11/13, angle A is arccos(11/13). So, angle B + angle C = π - arccos(11/13).

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that in triangle ABC, the product AB · AC can also be expressed in terms of the circumradius and the angle at A. Wait, AB · AC = c * b = (2R sin C)(2R sin B) = 4 R² sin B sin C. As before.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the formula for the area in terms of the inradius and semiperimeter. The area is r*s = 6s. Also, the area is (1/2)ab sin C. Wait, but we need to relate this to angle A.

Alternatively, let's recall that in triangle ABC, the distance from the incenter to vertex A is given by AI = \frac{r}{\sin \frac{A}{2}}. Wait, we have AI = 2*sqrt(39), and r = 6. Therefore:

AI = \frac{6}{\sin (A/2)} = 2\sqrt{39}

Therefore:

\sin (A/2) = \frac{6}{2\sqrt{39}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{39}} = \frac{\sqrt{39}}{13}

Wait, but earlier we found that sin(A/2) = 1/sqrt(13). Wait, that's a contradiction. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, the formula AI = r / sin(A/2) is correct? Let me verify.

Yes, in triangle AIO, right-angled at I, angle at A is A/2. Therefore, in triangle AIO:

sin(angle at A) = opposite / hypotenuse = OI / AO

But angle at A is A/2, opposite side is OI, hypotenuse is AO. Therefore:

sin(A/2) = OI / AO = sqrt(13)/13 = 1/sqrt(13)

Therefore, AI can also be expressed as:

AI = AO * sin(angle at O)

Wait, angle at O is 90 - A/2, so sin(angle at O) = sin(90 - A/2) = cos(A/2). Therefore, AI = AO * cos(A/2). Therefore:

AI = 13 * cos(A/2)

But we also have AI = 2*sqrt(39). Therefore:

13 * cos(A/2) = 2*sqrt(39)

Therefore, cos(A/2) = (2*sqrt(39))/13 = 2*sqrt(39)/13

But we also have from earlier that sin(A/2) = 1/sqrt(13). Let's check if sin²(A/2) + cos²(A/2) = 1:

(1/13) + (4*39)/169 = 1/13 + 156/169 = (13 + 156)/169 = 169/169 = 1. Yes, that works. So, that's consistent.

Therefore, angle A/2 has sin = 1/sqrt(13) and cos = 2*sqrt(39)/13.

Therefore, we can compute sin A using double-angle formula:

sin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2) = 2*(1/sqrt(13))*(2*sqrt(39)/13) = 4*sqrt(39)/13*sqrt(13) = 4*sqrt(3)/13

Wait, sqrt(39)/sqrt(13) = sqrt(3). Therefore:

sin A = 4*sqrt(3)/13

So, sin A = 4√3 /13.

But we also have cos A = 11/13, as computed earlier.

Therefore, using the identity sin² A + cos² A = 1:

(4√3 /13)² + (11/13)² = (16*3)/169 + 121/169 = 48/169 + 121/169 = 169/169 = 1. That checks out.

Now, going back to the Law of Sines, the sides can be expressed as:

a = BC = 2R sin A = 2*13*(4√3/13) = 2*4√3 = 8√3

b = AC = 2R sin B

c = AB = 2R sin C

But we need AB · AC = c * b = (2R sin C)(2R sin B) = 4R² sin B sin C

Therefore, as before, AB · AC = 4*13² sin B sin C = 676 sin B sin C

So, if we can find sin B sin C, we can compute the product.

But how?

We know that in triangle ABC, angles A + B + C = π. Therefore, B + C = π - A.

We can use the identity:

sin B sin C = [cos(B - C) - cos(B + C)] / 2

But since B + C = π - A, cos(B + C) = cos(π - A) = -cos A = -11/13

Therefore, sin B sin C = [cos(B - C) + 11/13] / 2

But unless we can find cos(B - C), this might not help directly. Alternatively, perhaps we can use another identity.

Alternatively, we can use the formula for sin B sin C in terms of the sides. Wait, from the Law of Sines, sin B = b/(2R), sin C = c/(2R). Therefore, sin B sin C = (b c)/(4 R²). Therefore, AB · AC = b c = 4 R² sin B sin C. Which is the same as before.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the formula for the area of the triangle in two different ways. The area is r*s = 6s, and also area = (1/2)ab sin C. Wait, but with sides and angles, perhaps we can relate it.

Alternatively, let's recall that in triangle ABC:

tan(A/2) = r / (s - a)

Where s is the semiperimeter. So, tan(A/2) = 6 / (s - a)

But we know that A/2 has sin = 1/sqrt(13), cos = 2*sqrt(39)/13, so tan(A/2) = sin(A/2)/cos(A/2) = (1/sqrt(13))/(2*sqrt(39)/13) = (1/sqrt(13)) * (13)/(2*sqrt(39)) = 13/(2*sqrt(13)*sqrt(39)) = sqrt(13)/(2*sqrt(39)) = sqrt(13)/(2*sqrt(13*3)) = 1/(2*sqrt(3)) = sqrt(3)/6

Therefore, tan(A/2) = sqrt(3)/6

Thus, 6 / (s - a) = sqrt(3)/6

Therefore, s - a = 6 / (sqrt(3)/6) = 6 * 6 / sqrt(3) = 36 / sqrt(3) = 12 sqrt(3)

Therefore, s - a = 12 sqrt(3)

But s is the semiperimeter, s = (a + b + c)/2. Therefore, s - a = (a + b + c)/2 - a = (-a + b + c)/2 = (b + c - a)/2 = 12 sqrt(3)

Therefore, (b + c - a)/2 = 12 sqrt(3) => b + c - a = 24 sqrt(3)

But we already found that a = BC = 8√3. Therefore, b + c - 8√3 = 24√3 => b + c = 32√3

Therefore, the sum of sides AC and AB is 32√3.

But we need the product AB · AC = b c. So, if we can find b + c and bc, we can use the relation (b + c)^2 = b² + c² + 2bc. But we don't have b² + c². Alternatively, perhaps we can relate this to other equations.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the formula for the area in terms of the inradius and semiperimeter. The area is r*s = 6s. Also, the area can be expressed as (1/2)ab sin C. Wait, but let's see. Alternatively, using Heron's formula: area = sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)]

But we might need more information. Alternatively, since we know the area is 6s, and the area is also equal to (1/2)ab sin C, but with a, b, c related by the Law of Cosines.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the formula for the distance between the inradius and circumradius. Wait, but we already used that in the beginning.

Alternatively, let's recall that in triangle ABC, the distance from the incenter to vertex A is given by AI = 2*sqrt(39). Also, AI can be expressed as AI = r / sin(A/2). Wait, we used that earlier. Since AI = 2*sqrt(39), and r = 6, then:

AI = 6 / sin(A/2) => sin(A/2) = 6 / AI = 6 / (2*sqrt(39)) = 3 / sqrt(39) = sqrt(39)/13. Wait, but earlier we had sin(A/2) = 1/sqrt(13). Wait, this is a contradiction. Wait, no, perhaps not.

Wait, let's clarify. The formula AI = r / sin(A/2) is correct. Wait, but we have AI = 2*sqrt(39), and r = 6. Therefore:

2*sqrt(39) = 6 / sin(A/2) => sin(A/2) = 6 / (2*sqrt(39)) = 3 / sqrt(39) = sqrt(39)/13 * (3/3) = sqrt(3)/sqrt(13). Wait, sqrt(39)/sqrt(3) = sqrt(13). Wait, 39 = 13*3, so sqrt(39) = sqrt(13*3) = sqrt(13)sqrt(3). Therefore, 3 / sqrt(39) = 3 / (sqrt(13)sqrt(3)) = sqrt(3)/sqrt(13). Therefore, sin(A/2) = sqrt(3)/sqrt(13) = sqrt(39)/13. Wait, sqrt(3)/sqrt(13) = sqrt(39)/13, because sqrt(3)/sqrt(13) = sqrt(3*13)/13 = sqrt(39)/13. Therefore, sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13. But earlier, we had sin(A/2) = 1/sqrt(13). Which is inconsistent.

Wait, this suggests a mistake in my previous reasoning. Let me check.

Earlier, we had triangle AIO right-angled at I. Therefore, sin(angle at A) = opposite / hypotenuse = OI / AO = sqrt(13)/13 = 1/sqrt(13). But angle at A is angle OAI, which is A/2. Therefore, sin(A/2) = OI / AO = sqrt(13)/13 = 1/sqrt(13). Therefore, sin(A/2) = 1/sqrt(13). But according to the formula AI = r / sin(A/2), we have AI = 6 / sin(A/2) = 6 / (1/sqrt(13)) = 6 sqrt(13). But earlier, we computed AI as sqrt(156) = 2 sqrt(39). However, 6 sqrt(13) is equal to 2 sqrt(39) because 6 sqrt(13) = sqrt(36*13) = sqrt(468), and 2 sqrt(39) = sqrt(4*39) = sqrt(156). Wait, 468 ≠ 156. Therefore, there is a contradiction here.

Wait, that suggests that one of the steps is wrong. Let's check.

In triangle AIO, right-angled at I. So, angle at I is 90 degrees, angle at A is A/2, angle at O is 90 - A/2. Therefore, in triangle AIO:

sin(angle at A) = opposite / hypotenuse = OI / AO = sqrt(13)/13 = 1/sqrt(13). Therefore, angle at A is arcsin(1/sqrt(13)), which is approximately 15 degrees. Then, angle OAI = A/2 ≈ 15 degrees, angle at O is 75 degrees.

Therefore, AI, which is the hypotenuse from A to I, would have length AO * cos(angle at A). Wait, angle at A is angle OAI = A/2, and AI is adjacent to angle A/2 in triangle AIO. Therefore, AI = AO * cos(A/2). Since AO = 13, AI = 13 * cos(A/2). But from triangle AIO, AO is the hypotenuse, so AI = AO * cos(A/2) and OI = AO * sin(A/2). Therefore, AI = 13 * cos(A/2). But earlier, from the right triangle AIO, AI = sqrt(AO² - OI²) = sqrt(13² - (sqrt(13))²) = sqrt(169 -13) = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39). Therefore, AI = 2*sqrt(39). Therefore, 2*sqrt(39) = 13 * cos(A/2) => cos(A/2) = 2*sqrt(39)/13. Therefore, cos(A/2) = 2*sqrt(39)/13. Therefore, sin(A/2) = sqrt(1 - (4*39)/169) = sqrt(1 - 156/169) = sqrt(13/169) = sqrt(13)/13. Therefore, sin(A/2) = sqrt(13)/13. Therefore, AI = 13 * cos(A/2) = 13 * (2*sqrt(39)/13) = 2*sqrt(39). Which matches with the previous result.

But according to the formula AI = r / sin(A/2), we have AI = 6 / sin(A/2) = 6 / (sqrt(13)/13) = 6 * 13 / sqrt(13) = 6*sqrt(13). But in reality, AI is 2*sqrt(39) = 2*sqrt(13*3) = 2*sqrt(13)*sqrt(3). Therefore, AI = 2*sqrt(13)*sqrt(3) = 2*sqrt(39). But according to the formula AI = 6 / sin(A/2), we have AI = 6 / (sqrt(13)/13) = 6*13/sqrt(13) = (78)/sqrt(13) = 78*sqrt(13)/13 = 6*sqrt(13). Therefore, 2*sqrt(39) vs 6*sqrt(13). Since sqrt(39) = sqrt(13*3) = sqrt(13)*sqrt(3), so 2*sqrt(13)*sqrt(3) vs 6*sqrt(13). Therefore, 2*sqrt(39) = 2*sqrt(13)*sqrt(3) ≈ 2*3.605*1.732 ≈ 12.73, whereas 6*sqrt(13) ≈ 6*3.605 ≈ 21.63. These are not equal. Therefore, there is a contradiction. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the application of the formula AI = r / sin(A/2).

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Let me check. The formula for the distance from the inradius to vertex A is indeed AI = r / sin(A/2). But according to our calculations, AI = 2*sqrt(39) and r = 6, so sin(A/2) should be 6 / AI = 6 / (2*sqrt(39)) = 3 / sqrt(39) = sqrt(39)/13. But we had earlier that sin(A/2) = sqrt(13)/13. Therefore, this is a contradiction. Therefore, one of the steps is wrong.

Wait, let's re-examine the triangle AIO. If triangle AIO is right-angled at I, then angle at O is 90 degrees. Wait, but O is the circumradius center, so IO is the distance from the circumcenter to the inradius. But in general, the line connecting the inradius and circumradius centers is not necessarily perpendicular to AI. Wait, but we were given that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, in the problem statement, it's given that IA is perpendicular to OI. Therefore, triangle AIO is right-angled at I. Therefore, in that triangle, angle at I is 90 degrees. Therefore, angle at A is angle OAI = A/2, angle at O is 90 - A/2. Therefore, in triangle AIO:

sin(angle at A) = OI / AO = sqrt(13)/13 = 1/sqrt(13). Therefore, angle at A is arcsin(1/sqrt(13)), which is approximately 15 degrees. Therefore, angle A/2 ≈ 15 degrees, so angle A ≈ 30 degrees. Then, cos(A/2) = sqrt(1 - (1/13)) = sqrt(12/13) = 2*sqrt(39)/13. Therefore, AI = AO * cos(A/2) = 13 * (2*sqrt(39)/13) = 2*sqrt(39). Therefore, AI = 2*sqrt(39). 

But according to the formula AI = r / sin(A/2), AI should be 6 / sin(A/2). But sin(A/2) is 1/sqrt(13), so 6 / (1/sqrt(13)) = 6*sqrt(13). Therefore, AI = 6*sqrt(13). But we have AI = 2*sqrt(39) = 2*sqrt(13*3) = 2*sqrt(13)*sqrt(3). Therefore, 2*sqrt(13)*sqrt(3) vs 6*sqrt(13). These are not equal. Therefore, this is a contradiction. Therefore, there must be a miscalculation here. 

Wait, perhaps the formula AI = r / sin(A/2) is incorrect. Let me check the formula. 

Upon reflection, the formula for the distance from the incenter to a vertex is given by:

AI = \frac{r}{\sin \frac{A}{2}}

Yes, that's the formula. Therefore, AI = r / sin(A/2). Therefore, AI = 6 / sin(A/2). But from triangle AIO, AI = 2*sqrt(39). Therefore, 2*sqrt(39) = 6 / sin(A/2) => sin(A/2) = 6 / (2*sqrt(39)) = 3 / sqrt(39) = sqrt(39)/13. Therefore, sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13. But earlier, we had from triangle AIO, sin(A/2) = OI / AO = sqrt(13)/13. Therefore, sqrt(13)/13 = sqrt(39)/13 => sqrt(13) = sqrt(39). Which is not true. Therefore, this is a contradiction. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the assumption that triangle AIO is right-angled at I. But the problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI. Therefore, triangle AIO is right-angled at I. Therefore, angle at I is 90 degrees. Therefore, the previous calculations must be correct. Therefore, sin(A/2) = sqrt(13)/13, which is approximately 0.277, but according to the formula AI = r / sin(A/2), AI should be 6 / (sqrt(13)/13) = 6*13/sqrt(13) = 6*sqrt(13). But triangle AIO gives AI = 2*sqrt(39) ≈ 12.49. However, 6*sqrt(13) ≈ 6*3.605 ≈ 21.63. These are different. Therefore, contradiction. Therefore, my initial assumption must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the triangle AIO is not the triangle we need. Wait, the problem says "IA · OI", which is the dot product if we consider vectors. But in the problem statement, it's written as "IA · OI", which could be the scalar product. However, in that case, IA and OI are vectors. Therefore, if IA is perpendicular to OI, their dot product is zero. However, in the problem statement, it's written as "IA · OI", which is the dot product, but in the problem statement, it's the product IA · OI. Wait, but in the problem statement, the user wrote:

"IA · OI", with a dot in between. So, it's the product IA multiplied by OI. But if IA is a vector and OI is a vector, then IA · OI is the dot product. However, the problem states "IA · OI", but then in the problem statement, it's written as "IA · OI", which is a dot product. However, in the problem statement, the user wrote:

"the circumradius R is 13, and inradius r is 6. Find AB · AC."

And earlier in the problem statement, they wrote:

"Find AB · AC."

Therefore, the problem is asking for the product AB multiplied by AC, not the dot product of vectors IA and OI. Therefore, my previous confusion is resolved. Therefore, the problem is not about vectors but about lengths. Therefore, IA is the length from I to A, OI is the length from O to I, and IA is perpendicular to OI, meaning that triangle AIO is right-angled at I. Therefore, OI is perpendicular to IA. Therefore, the triangle AIO is right-angled at I. Therefore, by Pythagoras, AO² = AI² + OI². Therefore, 13² = AI² + (sqrt(13))². Therefore, 169 = AI² + 13 => AI² = 156 => AI = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39). Therefore, AI = 2*sqrt(39). 

Therefore, from the formula AI = r / sin(A/2), we have AI = 6 / sin(A/2). Therefore, 2*sqrt(39) = 6 / sin(A/2) => sin(A/2) = 6 / (2*sqrt(39)) = 3 / sqrt(39) = sqrt(39)/13. Therefore, sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13. Therefore, angle A/2 = arcsin(sqrt(39)/13). Therefore, angle A = 2*arcsin(sqrt(39)/13). 

But we can compute cos A using the double-angle formula. cos A = 1 - 2 sin²(A/2) = 1 - 2*(39/169) = 1 - 78/169 = (169 - 78)/169 = 91/169 = 7/13. Therefore, cos A = 7/13. Therefore, sin A = sqrt(1 - (7/13)^2) = sqrt(1 - 49/169) = sqrt(120/169) = (2*sqrt(30))/13. Therefore, sin A = 2*sqrt(30)/13.

Therefore, sin A = 2*sqrt(30)/13. 

But we need sin B sin C. To find sin B sin C, perhaps we can use the identity:

sin B sin C = [cos(B - C) - cos(B + C)] / 2

But B + C = π - A, so cos(B + C) = cos(π - A) = -cos A = -7/13

Therefore:

sin B sin C = [cos(B - C) - (-7/13)] / 2 = [cos(B - C) + 7/13]/2

But we need another equation to find cos(B - C). Alternatively, perhaps we can use the Law of Sines to express sin B and sin C in terms of the sides and then use some relations.

Alternatively, we can use the formula for area in terms of inradius and semiperimeter. The area is r*s = 6s, and also area = (1/2)ab sin C. Wait, but we need to relate this to the sides.

Alternatively, we can use the formula for the product of the sines of the angles. There's a formula that relates sin B sin C to the sides and the circumradius. Let me recall.

We know that in any triangle:

sin B sin C = (b c) / (4 R²)

But we need sin B sin C, and we need b c. If we can express sin B sin C in terms of known quantities, perhaps we can solve for b c.

Alternatively, we can use the identity:

sin B sin C = [cos(B - C) - cos(B + C)] / 2

But as before, we need cos(B - C). Alternatively, if we use the formula for cos(B - C):

cos(B - C) = cos B cos C + sin B sin C

But we can express cos B and cos C in terms of the sides using the Law of Cosines.

But we might need more information. Alternatively, perhaps we can use the formula for the sum of angles B and C.

Since B + C = π - A, and A is known in terms of sin and cos. But we need another relation.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the formula for the area in terms of the inradius and semiperimeter. The area is 6s. Also, the area can be expressed as (1/2)ab sin C. But without knowing the specific sides, it's hard to relate directly.

Alternatively, let's recall that the semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2. We have already found that a = 8√3. Therefore, s = (8√3 + b + c)/2. Also, we found that b + c - a = 24√3, so b + c = 32√3. Therefore, s = (8√3 + 32√3)/2 = (40√3)/2 = 20√3. Therefore, the semiperimeter s = 20√3.

Therefore, the area is r*s = 6*20√3 = 120√3.

Therefore, the area of triangle ABC is 120√3.

But the area can also be expressed as (1/2)ab sin C. However, we need to relate this to the sides. Alternatively, using the formula area = (a b c)/(4 R). But we need all three sides, which we don't have.

Alternatively, we can use Heron's formula. The area is sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)]. But again, without knowing b and c, it's difficult.

Wait, but we know that s = 20√3, a = 8√3, and b + c = 32√3. Therefore, s - a = 20√3 - 8√3 = 12√3. Therefore, s - a = 12√3. Similarly, s - b = 20√3 - b, and s - c = 20√3 - c. 

But if we can express (s - b)(s - c) in terms of b + c and bc.

We know that (s - b)(s - c) = s² - s(b + c) + bc = (20√3)^2 - 20√3*(32√3) + bc = 1200 - 20√3*32√3 + bc = 1200 - 20*32*3 + bc = 1200 - 1920 + bc = -720 + bc.

Therefore, the area squared is [sqrt(s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c))]^2 = s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c) = 20√3 * 12√3 * (-720 + bc) = (20*12*3) * (-720 + bc) = 720*(-720 + bc) = 720*bc - 720².

But the area is 120√3, so area squared is (120√3)^2 = 14400*3 = 43200.

Therefore:

720*bc - 720² = 43200

Therefore:

720*bc = 43200 + 720² = 43200 + 518400 = 561600

Therefore:

bc = 561600 / 720 = 780

Therefore, bc = 780.

Therefore, AB · AC = bc = 780.

Therefore, the answer is \boxed{780}

**Final Answer**
\boxed{780}
Therefore, the product of the lengths of $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{AC}$ is $\boxed{780}$.
