Okay, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. So, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer walk every morning and stops at a coffee shop. The time she takes depends on her walking speed, and the time spent in the coffee shop is the same in both scenarios. We need to find out how long the walk takes when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, including the coffee shop time.

First, let's parse the information given. There are two different walking speeds mentioned: s km/h and s + 2 km/h. For each speed, the total time (walking + coffee shop) is different. The coffee shop time, t, is the same in both cases. 

So, the total time when walking at speed s is 4 hours, which includes t minutes. When walking at s + 2 km/h, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which also includes t minutes. We need to find the total time when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h.

Hmm. Let's start by converting all the times into the same unit. Since the answer needs to be in minutes, maybe convert everything to minutes. Let's see:

First scenario:
- Walking time (excluding coffee shop) at speed s: Let's denote this as T1 hours.
- Total time including coffee shop: 4 hours.
- So, T1 + t/60 = 4. Because t is in minutes, so we convert it to hours by dividing by 60.

Second scenario:
- Walking time (excluding coffee shop) at speed s + 2: T2 hours.
- Total time including coffee shop: 2 hours and 24 minutes. Converting 24 minutes to hours is 24/60 = 0.4 hours. So total time is 2.4 hours.
- So, T2 + t/60 = 2.4.

We also know that the walking distance is 9 km in both cases. So, the time taken to walk 9 km at speed s is 9/s hours, and at speed s + 2 is 9/(s + 2) hours. Therefore, T1 = 9/s and T2 = 9/(s + 2).

So, substituting these into the total time equations:

First scenario:
9/s + t/60 = 4

Second scenario:
9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4

Now we have two equations with two variables: s and t. Let's write them again:

1) 9/s + t/60 = 4

2) 9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4

If we subtract equation 2 from equation 1, the t/60 terms will cancel out:

[9/s - 9/(s + 2)] = 4 - 2.4

Simplify the right side: 4 - 2.4 = 1.6

So:

9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 1.6

Factor out 9:

9[1/s - 1/(s + 2)] = 1.6

Compute the expression inside the brackets:

1/s - 1/(s + 2) = [ (s + 2) - s ] / [s(s + 2)] = 2 / [s(s + 2)]

So:

9 * [2 / (s(s + 2))] = 1.6

Simplify:

18 / [s(s + 2)] = 1.6

Multiply both sides by s(s + 2):

18 = 1.6 s(s + 2)

Divide both sides by 1.6:

18 / 1.6 = s(s + 2)

Calculate 18 / 1.6:

18 ÷ 1.6 = 11.25

So:

s(s + 2) = 11.25

This is a quadratic equation:

s² + 2s - 11.25 = 0

Let's solve for s using quadratic formula:

s = [ -2 ± sqrt(4 + 45) ] / 2

Wait, discriminant is 4 + 4*1*11.25 = 4 + 45 = 49

So sqrt(49) = 7

Therefore:

s = [ -2 ± 7 ] / 2

We can discard the negative solution because speed can't be negative:

s = ( -2 + 7 ) / 2 = 5 / 2 = 2.5 km/h

So s = 2.5 km/h

Now, let's find t using equation 1:

9/s + t/60 = 4

Substitute s = 2.5:

9 / 2.5 + t/60 = 4

Calculate 9 / 2.5:

9 ÷ 2.5 = 3.6

So:

3.6 + t/60 = 4

Subtract 3.6:

t/60 = 0.4

Multiply both sides by 60:

t = 24 minutes

So the coffee shop time is 24 minutes.

Now, the question asks for the total time when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h. Let's compute s + 1/2:

s = 2.5, so s + 0.5 = 3 km/h

Walking time at 3 km/h is 9 / 3 = 3 hours. Adding the coffee shop time of 24 minutes:

3 hours + 24 minutes = 3 hours 24 minutes. Convert this entirely to minutes: 3*60 +24=180 +24=204 minutes.

Wait, but let me confirm. The total time is walking time plus coffee shop time. Walking time at 3 km/h is 9/3=3 hours. Coffee shop time is 24 minutes. So total time is 3 hours and 24 minutes. Converting 3 hours to minutes is 180, plus 24 minutes is 204 minutes. So the answer is 204 minutes.

But let me double-check all steps to make sure.

First, check the quadratic solution. We had:

s(s + 2) = 11.25

s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0

Discriminant: b² -4ac = 4 + 45=49

sqrt(49)=7

s=( -2 +7)/2=5/2=2.5. Correct.

Then, t=24 minutes. Then when speed is 3 km/h, walking time is 3 hours, coffee shop 24 minutes. Total 3*60+24=204. That seems right.

But let's verify the initial two scenarios with s=2.5 and t=24.

First scenario: speed 2.5 km/h. Walking time is 9/2.5=3.6 hours. Coffee shop 24 minutes. Total time: 3.6 + 0.4=4 hours. Correct.

Second scenario: speed s+2=4.5 km/h. Walking time is 9/4.5=2 hours. Coffee shop 24 minutes=0.4 hours. Total time:2 +0.4=2.4 hours, which is 2 hours 24 minutes. Correct.

So all checks out. Therefore, when she walks at 3 km/h, total time is 204 minutes. So the answer is 204.
Therefore, the total time Aya takes to complete her walk, including the coffee shop visit, when walking at $\frac{1}{2}$ km/h faster, is $\boxed{204}$ minutes.
