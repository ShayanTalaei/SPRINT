Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. Points D, E, C, F are collinear, meaning they all lie on a straight line. Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. We need to find the length of CE.

First, let me visualize the setup. Since ABCD is a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. Similarly, EFGH is a rectangle. Points D, E, C, F are on a straight line, so that line must be the line connecting DC and EF. Also, A, D, H, G are concyclic, meaning they lie on a circle. That's an important piece of information; maybe some cyclic quadrilateral properties can be applied here.

Let me label the points as per the problem. Let's draw rectangle ABCD with AB = 107 (height) and BC = 16 (width). So, AB is vertical, BC is horizontal. Then, rectangle EFGH is such that E and F are on the line DC, which is the base of rectangle ABCD. Wait, but ABCD is a rectangle, so DC is the base? Wait, if ABCD is a rectangle with AB and CD as the vertical sides, then DC would be the base. So, points D, E, C, F are collinear on the line DC, which is the base of the rectangle ABCD. Therefore, E and F are points along DC, with E between D and C, and F beyond C? Or maybe E is between D and C, and F is beyond C? Hmm.

Wait, but EFGH is a rectangle. So, EF is one of its sides. Given that EF = 184, which is longer than BC = 16. Also, FG = 17. Since EFGH is a rectangle, EF and FG are adjacent sides. So, EF is 184, FG is 17. Therefore, EFGH is a rectangle with length 184 and width 17. That's quite large compared to ABCD's dimensions.

But since E and F are on DC, which is a line of length BC = 16 (since ABCD is a rectangle with BC = 16). Wait, but DC is the base of the rectangle ABCD, so DC = AB = 107. Wait, no. Wait, in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So, AB and CD are both 107, and BC and AD are both 16. So, DC is 107 units long. Therefore, if D, E, C, F are collinear on DC, which is 107 units long, then the total length from D to C is 107. But EF is 184 units, which is longer than DC. That seems impossible unless E and F are not between D and C but extended beyond. Wait, but the problem says D, E, C, F are collinear, so they must lie on a straight line. So, maybe E is beyond D, and F is beyond C? Or maybe E is between D and C, and F is beyond C? Wait, but if E and F are on DC, which is 107 units, how can EF be 184? That seems contradictory. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here.

Wait, perhaps D, E, C, F are collinear in that order? So, starting from D, then E, then C, then F. If that's the case, then DE + EC + CF = DF. But EF is 184. Wait, but EF is a side of rectangle EFGH. If EF is 184, then the distance between E and F is 184. But if E and F are on DC, which is only 107 units long, then E and F must be positioned such that the distance between them is 184. That suggests that E and F are not both on DC. Wait, but the problem states D, E, C, F are collinear. So, they all lie on a straight line. So, the line DC is being extended beyond C and D? Wait, no. DC is the side of the rectangle ABCD. If D, E, C, F are collinear, then E and F must lie on the line DC. But DC is of length 107. If EF is 184, which is longer than DC, then E and F must be points such that when connected, their distance is 184. But if they are on a straight line of length 107, the maximum possible distance between two points on that line is 107. So, how can EF be 184? That seems impossible. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding in the setup.

Wait, perhaps DC is not the same as the side DC of rectangle ABCD? Wait, no. ABCD is a rectangle, so DC is a side. Wait, maybe the line DC is extended beyond C and D? Wait, but the problem says D, E, C, F are collinear. So, they lie on a straight line. If DC is 107, and EF is 184, which is longer, then E and F must be on the line DC extended beyond C and D. So, starting from D, going through E, then C, then F. So, DE + EC + CF = DF. But EF is 184, which is the distance between E and F. So, E and F are on a line that includes DC. So, E is between D and C, and F is beyond C such that EF = 184. But the distance from E to C is EC, and from C to F is CF. So, EF = EC + CF. Wait, but that would mean EC + CF = 184. But also, DC is 107, so DE + EC = DC = 107. So, DE = 107 - EC.

But we need to relate this to the rectangle EFGH. Since EFGH is a rectangle with sides EF = 184 and FG = 17. So, the sides of EFGH are 184 and 17. Therefore, the coordinates of E, F, G, H can be determined based on the positions of E and F on DC. Wait, but maybe we need to use coordinate geometry here.

Let me set up a coordinate system. Let's place point D at the origin (0, 0). Then, since ABCD is a rectangle with AB = 107 and BC = 16, point C would be at (107, 0), point B at (0, 107), and point A at (0, 107 + 16)? Wait, no. Wait, in a rectangle, the sides AB and BC are adjacent. If AB is vertical and BC is horizontal, then from point B (0, 107), moving right by BC = 16 would bring us to point C at (16, 107). Wait, but then DC would be from D (0, 0) to C (16, 107). Wait, that complicates things. Alternatively, maybe the rectangle is placed such that DC is horizontal. Let me think.

Wait, maybe I need to clarify the orientation. Let's assume that ABCD is a rectangle with AB and CD as vertical sides, and BC and AD as horizontal sides. So, if we place point D at (0, 0), then point C would be at (BC, 0) = (16, 0), point B at (16, AB) = (16, 107), and point A at (0, 107). Then, DC is the horizontal line from (0, 0) to (16, 0). Wait, but then DC is only 16 units long, but EF is 184. That contradicts the previous statement. Wait, this is confusing.

Wait, maybe the problem is that I'm misinterpreting the sides. Let me check the problem again. It says rectangles ABCD and EFGH. Points D, E, C, F are collinear. A, D, H, G lie on a circle. BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. So, ABCD is a rectangle with sides AB = 107 and BC = 16. So, AB is one side, BC is another. Therefore, AB is 107, BC is 16, so ABCD has length 107 and width 16.

Therefore, if we place point A at (0, 0), then point B would be at (0, 107), point C at (16, 107), and point D at (16, 0). Wait, but then DC would be from (16, 0) to (16, 107). Wait, no. Wait, if ABCD is a rectangle, then the sides AB and BC are adjacent. So, starting from A, moving to B, then to C, then to D, then back to A. So, if AB is vertical, BC is horizontal, then CD is vertical, and DA is horizontal. Therefore, coordinates would be: A(0, 0), B(0, 107), C(16, 107), D(16, 0). Then DC is from (16, 0) to (16, 107), which is vertical. Then, points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, D(16, 0), E somewhere, C(16, 107), F somewhere. Wait, but E and F are on DC? If DC is vertical, then E and F must lie on the vertical line x = 16. But EF is 184, which is a horizontal distance? Wait, no. Wait, if E and F are on the vertical line x = 16, then the distance between them would be along the y-axis. So, if E is at (16, y1) and F is at (16, y2), then EF would be |y2 - y1|. But the problem states EF = 184, which is a vertical distance. However, in the rectangle EFGH, EF is a side, so if EF is vertical, then FG would be horizontal. But FG is given as 17, so that's possible. Then, the rectangle EFGH would have vertical sides of length 184 and horizontal sides of length 17.

But then, if E and F are on DC, which is vertical from (16, 0) to (16, 107), then E and F must be on that line. But EF is 184, which is longer than DC (which is 107). Therefore, E and F cannot both be on DC. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding here.

Wait, perhaps the line DC is not the side DC of the rectangle ABCD, but another line? Wait, the problem says "D, E, C, F are collinear." So, they lie on a straight line. But in rectangle ABCD, points D and C are connected by side DC. If EF is 184, which is longer than DC, then E and F must be points on the line DC extended beyond C and D. Wait, but DC is a side of the rectangle, so unless the line DC is extended beyond C and D, E and F would lie on that extended line. So, D, E, C, F are colinear with E and F on the extended line beyond C and D. Therefore, the line DC is extended beyond D to E and beyond C to F. Therefore, DE + EC + CF = DF, but EF = 184. Wait, but EF is the distance between E and F, which would be EC + CF. Therefore, EC + CF = 184. But DC is 107. Wait, DC is the original segment from D to C, which is 107. If E is beyond D and F is beyond C, then EC + CF = EF = 184. But DC is 107, so EC = distance from E to C, which is ED + DC. Wait, if E is beyond D, then ED = x, so EC = ED + DC = x + 107. Similarly, if F is beyond C, then CF = y, so the distance from E to F would be EC + CF = (x + 107) + y = x + y + 107 = 184. Therefore, x + y = 184 - 107 = 77. So, x + y = 77.

But we also have the rectangle EFGH. Let's consider the coordinates. Let me set up coordinates again. Let's place point D at (0, 0). Then, since DC is 107 units, point C would be at (107, 0). Point E is on the line DC extended beyond D, so E is at (-x, 0) for some x > 0. Similarly, point F is on the line DC extended beyond C, so F is at (107 + y, 0) for some y > 0. Then, the distance between E and F is x + y + 107 = 184. So, x + y = 77.

Now, rectangle EFGH has sides EF = 184 and FG = 17. So, FG is the side from F to G. Since EF is horizontal (along the x-axis in our coordinate system), FG would be vertical. Therefore, point G would be at (107 + y, 17) or (107 + y, -17). Since rectangles have right angles, FG is perpendicular to EF. Therefore, FG is vertical. Similarly, GH is horizontal, and HE is vertical. So, point H would be at (-x, 17) or (-x, -17). But since A, D, H, G are concyclic, we need to ensure that these points lie on a circle.

Wait, point A is part of the rectangle ABCD. Let's figure out the coordinates of all points.

If we place D at (0, 0), then C is at (107, 0). E is at (-x, 0), F is at (107 + y, 0). Then, FG is 17 units. Since FG is vertical from F, G would be at (107 + y, 17). Similarly, H would be at (-x, 17). So, points A, D, H, G are concyclic. Let's figure out the coordinates of A. Since ABCD is a rectangle with AB = 107 and BC = 16. If D is at (0, 0), C is at (107, 0). Then, B is at (0, 107), and A is at (0, 107 + 16)? Wait, no. Wait, in a rectangle, AB is adjacent to BC. So, if AB is vertical and BC is horizontal, then AB would go from B(0, 0) to A(0, 107), and BC goes from B(0, 0) to C(16, 0). Wait, but this contradicts the earlier assumption. Wait, perhaps my coordinate system is messed up.

Wait, let's reorient the rectangle ABCD. Let me define the rectangle such that AB is vertical with length 107, BC is horizontal with length 16. So, starting from point A(0, 0), moving up AB to B(0, 107), then moving right BC to C(16, 107), then down CD to D(16, 0), and back to A. Therefore, DC is from D(16, 0) to C(16, 107). Wait, but DC is vertical, length 107. Then, points D(16, 0), E, C(16, 107), F are colinear. So, they lie on the vertical line x = 16. Therefore, E and F must be on x = 16 line. Then, EF is 184, which is the distance between E and F. But since they are on the vertical line x = 16, the distance between E and F would be |y_F - y_E|. But DC is from (16, 0) to (16, 107). So, E and F must be on the line x = 16, but beyond D and C. Let's say E is below D at (16, -a) and F is above C at (16, 107 + b). Then, the distance EF would be a + b + 107 = 184. Therefore, a + b = 77.

Then, rectangle EFGH: EF is vertical from E(16, -a) to F(16, 107 + b), which has length 107 + b - (-a) = 107 + a + b = 184. Then, FG is 17 units, which would be horizontal from F(16, 107 + b) to G(16 + 17, 107 + b) or G(16 - 17, 107 + b). Since rectangles have right angles, FG is horizontal. Let's assume it's to the right, so G is at (16 + 17, 107 + b) = (33, 107 + b). Then, H would be at (16 + 17, -a) = (33, -a). Then, GH is from G(33, 107 + b) to H(33, -a), which is vertical with length 107 + b + a = 184. Then, HA is from H(33, -a) to A(0, 0). Wait, but we need to check if A, D, H, G are concyclic.

Wait, point A is at (0, 0). Point D is at (16, 0). Point H is at (33, -a). Point G is at (33, 107 + b). So, we need these four points to lie on a circle. Let's check if they can be concyclic.

To find if four points lie on a circle, we can use the cyclic quadrilateral condition. For four points to be concyclic, the determinant of the following matrix must be zero:

|x_A y_A x_A² + y_A² 1|
|x_D y_D x_D² + y_D² 1|
|x_H y_H x_H² + y_H² 1|
|x_G y_G x_G² + y_G² 1|

But since this is a 4x4 determinant, it's a bit complicated. Alternatively, we can use the power of a point or other cyclic quadrilateral properties.

Alternatively, since A, D, H, G are concyclic, the power of point A with respect to the circle through D, H, G must satisfy the equation. The power of A is equal to AD * AG = AH * AF (if A lies outside the circle). Wait, maybe another approach.

Alternatively, since points A, D, H, G lie on a circle, the angles subtended by the chords must be equal. For example, angle AGD should be equal to angle AHD or something like that. Alternatively, using coordinates, we can set up the equation of the circle passing through three points and check if the fourth lies on it.

Let's proceed with coordinates. Let me assign coordinates to all points:

A(0, 0)

D(16, 0)

G(33, 107 + b)

H(33, -a)

We have a + b = 77.

We need these four points to lie on a circle. Let's find the equation of the circle passing through A, D, G, H.

The general equation of a circle is x² + y² + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0. Since the circle passes through A(0,0), substituting gives 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + c = 0 => c = 0. So, the equation is x² + y² + 2gx + 2fy = 0.

Now, substitute point D(16, 0):

16² + 0² + 2g*16 + 2f*0 = 0 => 256 + 32g = 0 => 32g = -256 => g = -8.

So, the equation becomes x² + y² - 16x + 2fy = 0.

Now, substitute point G(33, 107 + b):

33² + (107 + b)^2 - 16*33 + 2f*(107 + b) = 0.

Calculate 33² = 1089.

(107 + b)^2 = 107² + 2*107*b + b² = 11449 + 214b + b².

-16*33 = -528.

So, equation becomes:

1089 + 11449 + 214b + b² - 528 + 2f*(107 + b) = 0.

Simplify:

1089 + 11449 = 12538; 12538 - 528 = 12010.

So:

12010 + 214b + b² + 2f*(107 + b) = 0. --- (1)

Similarly, substitute point H(33, -a):

33² + (-a)^2 - 16*33 + 2f*(-a) = 0.

Which is same as:

1089 + a² - 528 - 2fa = 0 => 561 + a² - 2fa = 0. --- (2)

We also have a + b = 77 => b = 77 - a. Substitute b into equation (1):

12010 + 214*(77 - a) + (77 - a)^2 + 2f*(107 + 77 - a) = 0.

First, compute 214*(77 - a):

214*77 = let's compute 200*77 + 14*77 = 15400 + 1078 = 16478.

214* (-a) = -214a.

(77 - a)^2 = 77² - 154a + a² = 5929 - 154a + a².

2f*(107 + 77 - a) = 2f*(184 - a).

Putting it all together:

12010 + 16478 - 214a + 5929 - 154a + a² + 2f*(184 - a) = 0.

Combine like terms:

12010 + 16478 = 28488; 28488 + 5929 = 34417.

-214a -154a = -368a.

So:

34417 - 368a + a² + 2f*(184 - a) = 0. --- (3)

From equation (2):

561 + a² - 2fa = 0 => 2fa = 561 + a² => f = (561 + a²)/(2a). --- (4)

Substitute f into equation (3):

34417 - 368a + a² + 2*(561 + a²)/(2a)*(184 - a) = 0.

Simplify:

34417 - 368a + a² + (561 + a²)/(a)*(184 - a) = 0.

Multiply through by a to eliminate denominator:

a*(34417 - 368a + a²) + (561 + a²)*(184 - a) = 0.

Expand each term:

First term: 34417a - 368a² + a³.

Second term: 561*184 - 561a + 184a² - a³.

Compute 561*184: Let's compute 500*184 = 92,000; 61*184 = 11,224; total 92,000 + 11,224 = 103,224.

So, second term: 103,224 - 561a + 184a² - a³.

Combine both terms:

34417a - 368a² + a³ + 103,224 - 561a + 184a² - a³ = 0.

Simplify:

a³ - a³ cancels out.

-368a² + 184a² = -184a².

34417a - 561a = 33856a.

So, equation becomes:

-184a² + 33856a + 103,224 = 0.

Multiply both sides by -1:

184a² - 33856a - 103,224 = 0.

Divide equation by 8 to simplify:

23a² - 4232a - 12903 = 0.

Wait, 184 ÷ 8 = 23; 33856 ÷ 8 = 4232; 103224 ÷ 8 = 12903.

So, 23a² - 4232a - 12903 = 0.

This is a quadratic in a. Let's use quadratic formula:

a = [4232 ± sqrt(4232² + 4*23*12903)] / (2*23).

Compute discriminant:

D = (4232)^2 + 4*23*12903.

First compute (4232)^2:

4232 * 4232. Let's compute 4000² = 16,000,000; 232² = 53,824; cross term 2*4000*232 = 1,856,000. So total (4000 + 232)^2 = 16,000,000 + 1,856,000 + 53,824 = 17,909,824.

Now, compute 4*23*12903:

4*23 = 92; 92*12903 = let's compute 100*12903 = 1,290,300; subtract 8*12903 = 103,224; so 1,290,300 - 103,224 = 1,187,076.

Therefore, discriminant D = 17,909,824 + 1,187,076 = 19,096,900.

sqrt(19,096,900). Let's see: 4,360² = 19,009,600. Hmm, 4,360² = (4,000 + 360)^2 = 16,000,000 + 2*4,000*360 + 360² = 16,000,000 + 2,880,000 + 129,600 = 19,009,600. But our discriminant is 19,096,900, which is 19,009,600 + 87,300 = 19,096,900. So, sqrt(19,096,900) = 4,360 + (87,300)/(2*4,360) approximately. Wait, but maybe it's 4,360 + x. Let's check (4,360 + 10)^2 = 4,370² = (4,300 + 70)^2 = 4,300² + 2*4,300*70 + 70² = 18,490,000 + 602,000 + 4,900 = 19,096,900. Perfect! So sqrt(D) = 4,370.

Therefore, a = [4232 ± 4370]/(46).

Compute both possibilities:

First, a = (4232 + 4370)/46 = (8602)/46. Let's divide 8602 by 46. 46*180 = 8,280. 8602 - 8,280 = 322. 46*7 = 322. So, 180 + 7 = 187. So, a = 187.

Second, a = (4232 - 4370)/46 = (-138)/46 = -3. But since a represents a length (distance from D to E), it can't be negative. Therefore, a = 187.

Then, since a + b = 77, b = 77 - a = 77 - 187 = -110. Wait, that's negative. But b represents the extension beyond C, so if b is negative, that would mean F is below C? Wait, but in our coordinate system, we placed E at (16, -a) and F at (16, 107 + b). If b is negative, then F would be below C(16, 107). But that seems conflicting because we had E and F on the same vertical line x =16, with E below D(16,0) and F above C(16,107). But if b is negative, F would be at (16, 107 + b) = (16, 107 - 110) = (16, -3). Which is below D(16,0). But then E is at (16, -187), and F is at (16, -3). So, EF is from (16, -187) to (16, -3), which is 184 units. That's possible. However, point F is below D, which is at (16,0). So, in this case, EF is a vertical segment below the rectangle ABCD. But the circle passing through A, D, H, G would need to include these points.

But let's check if the coordinates with a = 187 and b = -110 satisfy the circle condition.

So, points:

A(0, 0)

D(16, 0)

G(33, 107 + b) = (33, 107 - 110) = (33, -3)

H(33, -a) = (33, -187)

So, points A(0,0), D(16,0), G(33, -3), H(33, -187). Let's check if these lie on a circle.

Using the circle equation x² + y² - 16x + 2fy = 0. We found f from equation (2):

f = (561 + a²)/(2a). Since a = 187,

f = (561 + 187²)/(2*187) = (561 + 34,969)/374 = 35,530/374 ≈ 95. So, let's compute exactly:

35,530 ÷ 374. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 2: 17,765 / 187. 187*95 = 187*90 + 187*5 = 16,830 + 935 = 17,765. So, f = 95.

Therefore, the circle equation is x² + y² -16x + 2*95*y = 0 => x² + y² -16x + 190y = 0.

Now, check if point G(33, -3) lies on this circle:

33² + (-3)^2 -16*33 + 190*(-3) = 1,089 + 9 - 528 - 570 = 1,098 - 528 - 570 = 1,098 - 1,098 = 0. Yes, it satisfies.

Check point H(33, -187):

33² + (-187)^2 -16*33 + 190*(-187) = 1,089 + 34,969 - 528 - 35,530 = (1,089 + 34,969) - (528 + 35,530) = 36,058 - 36,058 = 0. Also satisfies.

Therefore, with a = 187 and b = -110, all four points lie on the circle. So, this configuration is valid.

Therefore, the length CE is the distance from C(16, 107) to E(16, -187). Since they are on the vertical line x =16, the distance is |107 - (-187)| = |107 + 187| = 294. Wait, but the problem asks for CE. Wait, in our coordinate system, point C is at (16,107) and E is at (16, -187). So, CE is the distance between these two points: |107 - (-187)| = 294. Therefore, CE = 294.

But wait, in the problem statement, EF is 184, which is the distance between E and F, which we have as 184 (from (16, -187) to (16, -3)). Then, FG is 17, which is the horizontal distance from F(16, -3) to G(33, -3). But in our coordinate system, G is at (33, -3), so distance FG is |33 -16| =17. Correct. Then, GH is vertical from G(33, -3) to H(33, -187), which is 184 units. Then, HA is from H(33, -187) to A(0,0). Let's check the length of HA. The distance between (33, -187) and (0,0) is sqrt(33² + 187²) = sqrt(1,089 + 34,969) = sqrt(36,058) ≈ 189.83. But that's not a problem because the circle passes through these points regardless.

But the problem is asking for CE. In our coordinate system, CE is 294. However, let's check if there's another possible configuration. Because when we solved the quadratic equation, we only got a = 187, which leads to CE = 294. The other root was negative, which we discarded. Therefore, the only valid solution is CE = 294.

But wait, let me check once again. If a =187, then E is at (16, -187), which is 187 units below D. Then, F is at (16, 107 + b) = (16, 107 -110) = (16, -3). So, EF is from (16, -187) to (16, -3), which is 184 units. Then, FG is from (16, -3) to (33, -3), which is 17 units. Then, GH is from (33, -3) to (33, -187), which is 184 units. Then, HA is from (33, -187) to (0,0). So, all conditions are met.

Therefore, the length of CE is 294. But the problem statement mentions E, C, F are collinear. In our coordinate system, they are on x=16, which is correct. So, the answer should be 294. But let me check if the problem's numbers are consistent.

Given BC =16, AB=107. Then, in rectangle ABCD, AD should be equal to BC, so AD=16? Wait, no. Wait, in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So, AB = CD =107, and BC = AD =16. So, AD is 16, which is from A(0,0) to D(16,0), which is correct. Then, DC is from D(16,0) to C(16,107), which is vertical, length 107. Then, DA is from D(16,0) to A(0,0), length 16. So, that's correct.

Then, E is at (16, -187), F at (16, -3), G at (33, -3), H at (33, -187). Then, GH is vertical from (33, -3) to (33, -187), length 184. Then, FG is from (16, -3) to (33, -3), length 17. Then, HA is from (33, -187) to (0,0). Then, E, D, C, F are collinear on x=16. Then, A, D, H, G are concyclic, which we verified. So, everything checks out.

Therefore, the length of CE is 294. So, the answer is \boxed{294}.

**Final Answer**
The length of \( CE \) is \boxed{294}.
Therefore, the length of $CE$ is $\boxed{294}$.
