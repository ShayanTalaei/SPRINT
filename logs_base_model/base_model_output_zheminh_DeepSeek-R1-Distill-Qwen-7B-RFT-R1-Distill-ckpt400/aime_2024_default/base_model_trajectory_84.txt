Okay, so I need to solve this system of logarithmic equations involving x, y, and z. Then, once I find x, y, and z, I have to compute the absolute value of log base 2 of x^4 y^3 z^2, which will give me a fraction m/n, and then find m + n. Alright, let's start by understanding the problem.

First, the given equations are all logarithms base 2. Let me write them down again to make sure I have them correctly:

1. log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4

And we need to find |log₂(x⁴ y³ z²)|. Hmm. Since all the logs are base 2, maybe I can convert these logarithmic equations into exponential form to make them easier to handle. Let me recall that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to a = b^c. So applying that here:

1. x/(y z) = 2^(1/2) = sqrt(2)
2. y/(x z) = 2^(1/3)
3. z/(x y) = 2^(1/4)

So now we have three equations:

1. x = y z sqrt(2)
2. y = x z 2^(1/3)
3. z = x y 2^(1/4)

Hmm, okay. So each variable is expressed in terms of the product of the other two variables multiplied by some power of 2. Maybe I can substitute these equations into each other to solve for one variable first.

Let me see. Let's take the first equation: x = y z * sqrt(2). Then substitute this x into the second equation. The second equation is y = x z * 2^(1/3). So substituting x:

y = (y z * sqrt(2)) * z * 2^(1/3)

Simplify that:

y = y z² sqrt(2) * 2^(1/3)

Divide both sides by y (since y is positive and non-zero):

1 = z² sqrt(2) * 2^(1/3)

So 1 = z² * 2^(1/2) * 2^(1/3) = z² * 2^(1/2 + 1/3) = z² * 2^(5/6)

Therefore, z² = 2^(-5/6)

Taking square roots (since z is positive):

z = 2^(-5/12)

Okay, so z is 2^(-5/12). Let me note that down.

Now, knowing that z = 2^(-5/12), maybe we can substitute this back into one of the equations to find y or x. Let's use the third equation: z = x y 2^(1/4). Wait, no, the third equation was z = x y 2^(1/4). Wait, original third equation is log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4, so z/(x y) = 2^(1/4), so z = x y 2^(1/4). But we already have z in terms of x and y. Let me see.

Wait, maybe it's better to substitute z into another equation. Let's take the first equation: x = y z sqrt(2). Since z is known in terms of 2, maybe express x in terms of y, then substitute into the second equation.

But wait, we already found z in terms of 2. Let me substitute z into the third equation. Wait, the third equation is z = x y 2^(1/4). Since we have z = 2^(-5/12), so:

2^(-5/12) = x y 2^(1/4)

Therefore, x y = 2^(-5/12 - 1/4) = 2^(-5/12 - 3/12) = 2^(-8/12) = 2^(-2/3)

So x y = 2^(-2/3). Let's note that.

Also, from the first equation, x = y z sqrt(2). Since z is 2^(-5/12), then:

x = y * 2^(-5/12) * sqrt(2) = y * 2^(-5/12) * 2^(1/2) = y * 2^(-5/12 + 6/12) = y * 2^(1/12)

Therefore, x = y * 2^(1/12). So x = 2^(1/12) * y.

But we also have x y = 2^(-2/3). So substituting x = 2^(1/12) y into x y:

(2^(1/12) y) * y = 2^(1/12) y² = 2^(-2/3)

Therefore, y² = 2^(-2/3) / 2^(1/12) = 2^(-2/3 - 1/12) = 2^(-8/12 - 1/12) = 2^(-9/12) = 2^(-3/4)

Therefore, y = 2^(-3/8). Since y is positive.

So y = 2^(-3/8). Then, x = 2^(1/12) * y = 2^(1/12) * 2^(-3/8) = 2^(1/12 - 3/8). Let's compute the exponent:

1/12 - 3/8 = (2/24 - 9/24) = (-7/24). So x = 2^(-7/24).

So now we have x = 2^(-7/24), y = 2^(-3/8), z = 2^(-5/12). Let me check if these values satisfy all three equations.

First equation: x/(y z) = 2^(1/2). Let's compute x/(y z):

x = 2^(-7/24)

y = 2^(-3/8) = 2^(-9/24)

z = 2^(-5/12) = 2^(-10/24)

So y z = 2^(-9/24) * 2^(-10/24) = 2^(-19/24)

Then x/(y z) = 2^(-7/24) / 2^(-19/24) = 2^(-7/24 + 19/24) = 2^(12/24) = 2^(1/2). Which matches the first equation. Good.

Second equation: y/(x z) = 2^(1/3). Let's compute y/(x z):

y = 2^(-3/8) = 2^(-9/24)

x = 2^(-7/24)

z = 2^(-10/24)

x z = 2^(-7/24) * 2^(-10/24) = 2^(-17/24)

Then y/(x z) = 2^(-9/24) / 2^(-17/24) = 2^(8/24) = 2^(1/3). Which is correct. Good.

Third equation: z/(x y) = 2^(1/4). Let's check:

z = 2^(-10/24)

x = 2^(-7/24)

y = 2^(-9/24)

x y = 2^(-7/24 - 9/24) = 2^(-16/24) = 2^(-2/3)

Then z/(x y) = 2^(-10/24) / 2^(-16/24) = 2^(6/24) = 2^(1/4). Correct. All equations are satisfied. So the values are correct.

Now, we need to compute |log₂(x⁴ y³ z²)|. Let's compute the expression inside the log first.

First, compute x⁴ y³ z²:

x⁴ = (2^(-7/24))^4 = 2^(-28/24) = 2^(-7/6)

y³ = (2^(-3/8))^3 = 2^(-9/8)

z² = (2^(-5/12))^2 = 2^(-10/12) = 2^(-5/6)

Multiply them together:

x⁴ y³ z² = 2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6) = 2^(-7/6 -9/8 -5/6)

First, let's compute the exponents:

Convert all to 24 denominators:

-7/6 = -28/24

-9/8 = -27/24

-5/6 = -20/24

Adding them together: -28 -27 -20 = -75 over 24. So total exponent is -75/24.

Simplify: -75/24 = -25/8.

Therefore, x⁴ y³ z² = 2^(-25/8)

Therefore, log₂(x⁴ y³ z²) = log₂(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8.

Taking absolute value, | -25/8 | = 25/8. So m =25, n=8. They are coprime. Therefore, m + n = 33.

Wait, but let me double-check my exponents to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

x⁴: x is 2^(-7/24), so x^4 is 2^(-28/24) = 2^(-7/6). Correct.

y³: y is 2^(-3/8), so y^3 is 2^(-9/8). Correct.

z²: z is 2^(-5/12), so z² is 2^(-10/12) = 2^(-5/6). Correct.

Multiplying exponents: -7/6 -9/8 -5/6.

Convert to 24 denominator:

-7/6 = -28/24

-9/8 = -27/24

-5/6 = -20/24

Adding: -28 -27 -20 = -75. So -75/24. Simplify: -75/24 = -25/8. Correct. So log is -25/8, absolute value is 25/8. So 25 + 8 = 33. So the answer is 33. Hmm, seems straightforward. Let me check the steps again to make sure.

Starting from the log equations, converted to exponential form. Then solved for z in terms of y and x, substituted into other equations, found expressions for x and y in terms of exponents. Then substituted back to get all variables. Checked the values in original equations. Then computed x^4 y^3 z^2 as 2^(-25/8), so log is -25/8, absolute value 25/8. So m + n = 33. Seems correct.

I think that's all. Let me just check the arithmetic once more.

Calculating the exponents for x⁴ y³ z²:

x⁴: exponent is 4 * (-7/24) = -28/24

y³: exponent is 3 * (-3/8) = -9/8 = -27/24

z²: exponent is 2 * (-5/12) = -10/12 = -5/6 = -20/24

Adding them: -28/24 -27/24 -20/24 = (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -25/8. Correct.

Therefore, log base 2 is -25/8, absolute value 25/8. So m =25, n=8, sum 33. Yep, that's correct. So the answer is 33.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{33}
Therefore, the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\frac{\boxed{33}}{8}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

\boxed{33}

Wait, hold on. Wait, the final answer is supposed to be |log₂(x⁴ y³ z²)|, which we found to be 25/8. So m =25, n=8. Then m + n = 33. But the user wrote "the value of |log₂(x⁴y³z²)| is m/n where m and n are relatively prime positive integers. Find m+n." So m is 25, n is 8, so m + n is 33. So the final answer is 33. So the final answer is 33. So the \boxed{33} is correct. So that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{33}
