Okay, so I need to find the distance from the incenter of a tetrahedron to each of its faces. The tetrahedron has all its opposite edges equal: AB=CD=√41, AC=BD=√80, and BC=AD=√89. The distance should be expressed in the form m√n/p, where m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then sum m + n + p. 

First, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius (the distance from the incenter to each face) can be found using the formula r = 3V / S, where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area. So I need to find the volume and the surface area.

But how do I compute the volume of this tetrahedron? Since all opposite edges are equal, maybe it's a special kind of tetrahedron. Wait, in a regular tetrahedron, all edges are equal, but here edges are in pairs. So maybe this is a "equifacial" tetrahedron or something? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's orthocentric? Wait, not necessarily. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe it's a disphenoid. A disphenoid is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. Yes, that's exactly the case here. So this is a disphenoid. For a disphenoid, there are formulas for the volume and surface area. Let me recall.

In a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula V = (sqrt((a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 + c^2 - b^2)(b^2 + c^2 - a^2)))/72. Wait, no, maybe that's for something else. Let me check.

Wait, maybe I should use coordinates. Since the tetrahedron has opposite edges equal, perhaps I can assign coordinates to the vertices such that the calculations are easier. Let me try that.

Let me place vertex A at (0, 0, 0). Then, since AB = √41 and AC = √80 and AD = √89, but wait, the edges are given as AB=CD=√41, AC=BD=√80, BC=AD=√89. So AB is connected to CD, etc. So maybe the coordinates need to be set up accordingly.

Alternatively, maybe using vectors. Let me consider the centroid of the tetrahedron. Wait, but perhaps coordinates would be better. Let me try to assign coordinates step by step.

Let me place point A at (0, 0, 0). Let me place point B at (x, 0, 0). Then, point D is connected to A with length AD = √89, so D would be at (p, q, r) such that the distance from A is √(p² + q² + r²) = √89. Similarly, point C is connected to B with BC = √89. Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, maybe use the property that in a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula V = (1/3) * sqrt((a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²)) where a, b, c are the lengths of the edges. Wait, but I need to verify if that's correct.

Wait, actually, for a tetrahedron with three pairs of equal opposite edges, the volume can be computed using the formula involving the squares of the edges. Let me recall that formula.

In a tetrahedron with edges AB = CD = l, AC = BD = m, AD = BC = n, the volume is given by V = sqrt( (l² + m² - n²)(l² + n² - m²)(m² + n² - l²) ) / (72). Wait, is that correct? Wait, I might be confusing with another formula.

Wait, let me check. If all opposite edges are equal, then it's a disphenoid. The volume of a disphenoid can be computed using the formula V = sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) ) / 72, where a, b, c are the lengths of the edges. Wait, but in our case, the edges are AB=CD=√41, AC=BD=√80, BC=AD=√89. So the edges are l = √41, m = √80, n = √89. So the formula would be V = sqrt( (l² + m² - n²)(l² + n² - m²)(m² + n² - l²) ) / 72.

Let me compute each term:

First term: l² + m² - n² = 41 + 80 - 89 = 32

Second term: l² + n² - m² = 41 + 89 - 80 = 50

Third term: m² + n² - l² = 80 + 89 - 41 = 128

So the product is 32 * 50 * 128. Let me compute that:

32 * 50 = 1600

1600 * 128 = 204,800

So sqrt(204,800) = sqrt(2048 * 100) = sqrt(2048) * 10 = 32√2 * 10 = 320√2

Wait, but 2048 is 1024*2, so sqrt(1024*2*100) = 32*sqrt(2)*10 = 320√2. So sqrt(204800) = 320√2.

Therefore, the volume V = 320√2 / 72 = simplify this fraction.

Divide numerator and denominator by 8: 320 / 8 = 40, 72 /8=9. So 40√2 /9. Therefore, the volume is 40√2 / 9.

Wait, that seems a bit straightforward. Let me verify.

Wait, if the formula is V = sqrt( (l² + m² - n²)(l² + n² - m²)(m² + n² - l²) ) / 72, then plugging in l=√41, m=√80, n=√89, then:

First term: 41 +80 -89 =32

Second term:41 +89 -80=50

Third term:80 +89 -41=128

So product is 32*50*128=204,800

sqrt(204,800)=sqrt(2048*100)=sqrt(2048)*10= (32√2)*10=320√2

Then divide by 72: 320√2 /72=40√2 /9. Yes, correct.

So volume V=40√2 /9.

Okay, so volume is 40√2 /9.

Now, need to find the surface area S. Since the tetrahedron is a disphenoid, all four faces are congruent? Wait, no. Wait, in a disphenoid, the four faces are congruent in pairs. Wait, let me think.

Wait, in a disphenoid, opposite edges are equal, so the faces come in congruent pairs. But in this case, all faces are congruent? Wait, not necessarily. Let me check.

Wait, each face is a triangle. For example, face ABC: edges AB=√41, BC=√89, AC=√80.

Similarly, face ABD: edges AB=√41, BD=√80, AD=√89.

So triangle ABC has sides √41, √89, √80, and triangle ABD has sides √41, √80, √89. So they are congruent triangles. Similarly, face ACD: edges AC=√80, CD=√41, AD=√89. Same as ABC. Similarly, face BCD: edges BC=√89, CD=√41, BD=√80. Same as ABD. So all four faces are congruent. So each face is a triangle with sides √41, √80, √89.

Therefore, the surface area S is 4 times the area of one face.

So compute the area of one face. Let's compute the area of triangle with sides √41, √80, √89.

Use Heron's formula. Let me compute the semi-perimeter first.

s = (√41 + √80 + √89)/2

But Heron's formula might get messy. Alternatively, since the sides are √41, √80, √89, maybe it's a right triangle?

Check if (√41)^2 + (√80)^2 = (√89)^2.

41 + 80 = 121, which is 11², but √89 squared is 89. So 121 ≠89. So not a right triangle. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe use the formula for area in terms of sides: area = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)).

But since the sides are square roots, this might be complicated. Let me compute numerically.

Wait, maybe square the sides. Let me see:

Alternatively, use vectors or coordinates to compute the area. Wait, if I can assign coordinates to the triangle, then the area can be computed via cross product.

Let me try that. Let me place the triangle with sides √41, √80, √89.

Let me denote the triangle as triangle ABC with AB=√41, BC=√89, AC=√80.

Let me place point A at (0,0,0), point B at (√41, 0, 0). Then point C is somewhere in the plane. Let me compute coordinates of C.

Given that AC=√80 and BC=√89. So coordinates of C=(x,y,0). Then:

Distance from A to C: sqrt(x² + y²) = √80 => x² + y² =80

Distance from B to C: sqrt( (x - √41)^2 + y² ) = √89 => (x - √41)^2 + y² =89

Subtract first equation from second:

(x - √41)^2 + y² - (x² + y²) =89 -80 => x² - 2√41 x +41 + y² -x² - y² =9 => -2√41 x +41=9 => -2√41 x= -32 => x=32/(2√41)=16/√41

Then x=16/√41. Then y²=80 -x²=80 - (256/41)= (3280 -256)/41= (3024)/41= 3024/41. 3024 divided by 41: 41*73=3000 +41*3=123, 3000+123=3123. Wait, 3024-3123= -99. Hmm, seems like 3024/41 is 73.73... Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, 41*70=2870, 41*73=2870 + 41*3=2870+123=2993, 41*74=2993+41=3034. So 3024-2993=31. So 3024=41*73 +31. So 3024/41=73 +31/41. Therefore, y²=73 +31/41= (73*41 +31)/41. Wait, but maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, x=16/√41, so x²=256/41. Therefore, y²=80 -256/41= (80*41 -256)/41= (3280 -256)/41=3024/41. So y= sqrt(3024/41). Let's compute sqrt(3024/41). 3024 divided by 41 is approximately 3024/41≈73.73. So sqrt(73.73)≈8.58. But exact value?

Wait, 3024=16*189=16*9*21=16*9*3*7=16*27*7. So sqrt(3024)=sqrt(16*27*7)=4*sqrt(189)=4*sqrt(9*21)=4*3*sqrt(21)=12√21. Therefore, sqrt(3024/41)=12√21 /√41. Rationalize the denominator: 12√(21*41)/41=12√861 /41. So y=12√861 /41.

Therefore, coordinates of C are (16/√41, 12√861 /41, 0). Then vectors AB and AC can be used to compute the area via cross product.

Vectors AB=(√41, 0, 0), AC=(16/√41, 12√861 /41, 0). The cross product AB × AC is (0,0, √41*(12√861 /41) -0*16/√41 )= (0,0, (12√861 *√41)/41 ). Simplify:

√861 *√41=√(861*41)=√(35251). Wait, 861*41: 800*41=32,800, 60*41=2,460, 1*41=41; total 32,800+2,460=35,260+41=35,301. So √35,301. Hmm, 35,301. Let me check if 35,301 is a square. 187²=34,969, 188²=35,344. So 35,301 is between them. So √35,301 is irrational. Therefore, cross product magnitude is (12√35,301)/41. Therefore, area is (1/2)*|AB × AC| = (6√35,301)/41. Hmm, but this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Wait, maybe use the formula for area with sides a, b, c. So Heron's formula. Let me compute semi-perimeter s=(√41 +√80 +√89)/2. Then area= sqrt(s(s -√41)(s -√80)(s -√89)). But this is going to be messy. Alternatively, use the cosine law to find an angle and then compute area as (1/2)ab sinθ.

Let me try that. Let's compute angle at A. Using the cosine law:

cosθ = (AC² + AB² - BC²)/(2*AC*AB)

So cosθ=(80 +41 -89)/(2*√41*√80)= (32)/(2*√3280)=16/√3280. Simplify √3280: 3280=16*205. So √3280=4√205. Therefore, cosθ=16/(4√205)=4/√205. Then sinθ=√(1 - (16/205))=√(189/205)=√(189)/√205= (3√21)/√205. Therefore, area=(1/2)*AB*AC*sinθ=(1/2)*√41*√80*(3√21)/√205.

Compute √41*√80=√(41*80)=√3280=4√205. Then multiply by 3√21: 4√205*3√21=12√(205*21)=12√4305. Then divide by √205: 12√4305 /√205=12√(4305/205)=12√21. Therefore, area=(1/2)*12√21=6√21. Therefore, the area of each face is 6√21. Therefore, total surface area S=4*6√21=24√21.

Wait, that's a much better result! So the surface area is 24√21.

Therefore, the inradius r=3V/S=3*(40√2 /9)/(24√21)= (120√2 /9)/(24√21)= (40√2 /3)/(24√21)= (40√2)/(3*24√21)= (40√2)/(72√21)= Simplify numerator and denominator.

Simplify 40/72=5/9. Then √2/√21=√(2/21). Therefore, r=5/9 *√(2/21)=5/9 *√(2)/√(21)=5/(9√(21/2)). Wait, but rationalizing the denominator:

√(2/21)=√(42)/21. Wait, √(2/21)=√42 /21. Yes, because √(2/21)=√(2*21)/21=√42 /21. Therefore, r=5/9*(√42 /21)=5√42 / (9*21)=5√42 /189. Simplify 5 and 189: 189=9*21=9*3*7. 5 is prime. So 5 and 189 are coprime. So r=5√42 /189.

But check if √42 can be simplified. 42=6*7, so no square factors. So the expression is 5√42 /189. Therefore, m=5, n=42, p=189. Check if 42 is square-free: yes, 42=2*3*7. So n=42. Then m +n +p=5 +42 +189=236.

Wait, but 5 and 189: 189=9*21=9*3*7. So 5 and 189 share no common factors. So 5√42 /189 is the reduced form. Therefore, the answer is 5 +42 +189=236.

Wait, but let me verify the calculations again to be sure.

First, volume V=40√2 /9. Surface area S=24√21. Then r=3V/S=3*(40√2 /9)/(24√21)= (120√2 /9)/(24√21)= (40√2 /3)/(24√21)= (40√2)/(72√21)=5√2/(9√21). Then rationalizing:

5√2/(9√21)=5√(2*21)/(9*21)=5√42 /189. Yes, that's correct.

So the distance is 5√42 /189, so m=5, n=42, p=189. Sum is 5+42+189=236.

But let me check if there is a step where I miscalculated. For example, when computing the area of the face, I used Heron's formula and got 6√21. Let me verify that.

Given sides √41, √80, √89. Using cosine law, found angle at A, then computed sinθ, then area as 6√21. Let me check that again.

Alternatively, using Heron's formula. Let's compute s=(√41 +√80 +√89)/2. Then s -a= (√80 +√89 -√41)/2, etc. But Heron's formula is messy here. Alternatively, using vectors, I found the cross product magnitude as 12√21 /41, but actually, wait, in the cross product, I think I messed up. Let me check.

Wait, earlier when calculating the cross product, I had AB=(√41,0,0), AC=(16/√41, 12√861 /41,0). Then cross product AB × AC is (0,0, √41*(12√861 /41) -0*16/√41). So the z-component is (√41 *12√861)/41=12√(41*861)/41. Then √(41*861)=√(41*41*21)=41√21. So 12*41√21 /41=12√21. Therefore, the magnitude of cross product is 12√21, so area is 1/2 *12√21=6√21. Therefore, that's correct. So area is 6√21. Therefore, surface area S=4*6√21=24√21. Correct.

So r=3V/S=3*(40√2 /9)/(24√21)= (120√2 /9)/(24√21)= (40√2 /3)/(24√21)= (40√2)/(72√21)=5√2/(9√21)=5√42 /189. Correct.

Therefore, the answer is 5 +42 +189=236.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{236}
