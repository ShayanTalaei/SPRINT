Okay, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. So, we have a list of positive integers with a few specific properties. The sum of the items is 30, the unique mode is 9, the median is a positive integer not in the list, and we need to find the sum of the squares of all the items. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, let's recall what each term means. The mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list. Since the mode is unique and it's 9, that means 9 appears more times than any other number in the list. So, 9 occurs at least twice, and all other numbers can occur at most once or less than the number of times 9 occurs.

The median is the middle number when the list is ordered from smallest to largest. If the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list, that tells us something about the structure of the list. Let me think. If the median is a number that's not in the list, then the list must have an even number of elements. Because if there were an odd number of elements, the median would be the middle one, which would have to be present in the list. So, the list must have an even number of items. Let's denote the number of elements as n, so n must be even.

Also, the median being a number not in the list implies that the middle two numbers (since n is even) average to a non-integer? Wait, no. Wait, if n is even, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. But the problem states that the median is a positive integer. So, the average of the two middle numbers is an integer, but that integer is not present in the list. So, that average must be a number that's not in the list. Hmm, okay.

So, let's note that:

1. The list has an even number of elements, n, which is even.
2. The median is (a + b)/2, where a and b are the two middle numbers, and this is an integer not present in the list.
3. Since the median is an integer, (a + b) must be even, so a and b must be both even or both odd.
4. Also, since the median is not in the list, the average (a + b)/2 is not equal to any element in the list.

Let me consider the implications. Suppose the list is ordered: x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ. Then, the median is (x_{n/2} + x_{n/2 +1}) / 2. Since the median is an integer, x_{n/2} and x_{n/2 +1} must be both even or both odd. Also, the average is not present in the list.

Let me think about possible n. Since the sum of the list is 30, which is a relatively small number. Let's try to figure out possible n. The number of elements can't be too small, because the mode is 9, which has to appear at least twice. So, n must be at least 2. But if n is 2, the list would be [9, 21], since the sum is 30. But the median would be (9 + 21)/2 = 15, which is not in the list. But the mode is 9, which appears once in this case. Wait, but the mode needs to be unique. If the list is [9, 21], then 9 and 21 both appear once, so there is no unique mode. Therefore, n=2 is impossible.

Next, n=4. Let's see. The list has four numbers, sum is 30. The mode is 9, so 9 must appear at least twice. Let's try to construct such a list. Let's say the list is [9, 9, a, b], with a ≤ b. The sum is 9 + 9 + a + b = 30, so a + b = 12. The median is (9 + a)/2. Wait, no. If n=4, the two middle numbers are the second and third, which are 9 and a. So, the median is (9 + a)/2. This median must be an integer not in the list. So, (9 + a)/2 is an integer, so 9 + a must be even, so a must be odd. Also, the median (9 + a)/2 is not in the list, so it can't be 9 or a or b.

Let's try possible a. Since a must be at least 1, and a ≤ b. Since a + b =12, and a ≤ b, so a can be from 1 to 6. But a must be odd, so a can be 1, 3, 5.

Case 1: a=1. Then b=11. The list is [9,9,1,11]. The median is (9 +1)/2=5. 5 is not in the list. Good. The mode is 9, which appears twice. But we need to check if there is another number that appears twice. 1 appears once, 11 appears once. So, 9 is the unique mode. So, this works. The sum of squares is 9² +9² +1² +11²=81+81+1+121=284. But let's check other possibilities.

Case 2: a=3. Then b=9. The list is [9,9,3,9]. Wait, but then the sorted list is [3,9,9,9]. The mode is 9, which appears three times. The median is (9 +9)/2=9. But 9 is in the list. However, the problem states that the median is a positive integer not in the list. So this case is invalid.

Case 3: a=5. Then b=7. The list is [9,9,5,7]. The median is (9 +5)/2=7. But 7 is in the list. So, invalid.

So, only the first case works. So, the list is [1,9,9,11]. Wait, but in the sorted order, it's [1,9,9,11]. The median is (9 +9)/2=9, but wait, that's not correct. Wait, n=4, so the two middle numbers are the second and third elements. If the list is sorted, it's [1,9,9,11]. So, the median is (9 +9)/2=9. But 9 is in the list. So, this violates the condition that the median is not in the list. Wait, so this case is invalid. So, the median is 9, which is in the list. So, this case is invalid.

Wait, but in the first case, a=1, then the sorted list is [1,9,9,11]. The median is (9 +9)/2=9. But 9 is in the list. So, the median is in the list, which violates the condition. So, this case is invalid as well. Hmm, so n=4 seems problematic.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the median. Wait, if the list is [1,9,9,11], then the two middle numbers are 9 and 9. So, the median is (9 +9)/2=9. But 9 is in the list, so this is invalid. So, this case doesn't work.

So, n=4 is impossible? But then maybe n=6?

Let me try n=6. Then the list has six numbers, sum is 30. The mode is 9, so 9 appears at least twice. Let's suppose it appears three times. Then the remaining three numbers must sum to 30 - 9*3=30-27=3. Since all numbers are positive integers, the remaining three numbers could be 1,1,1. But then the mode would be 1 as well, since 1 appears three times. But the problem states the unique mode is 9, so that's invalid.

Alternatively, maybe 9 appears four times. Then the remaining two numbers sum to 30 - 9*4=30-36= -6, which is impossible. So, 9 can't appear four times.

So, 9 can appear three times. Then the remaining three numbers sum to 3. They must be positive integers. The only way is 1,1,1. But that makes the mode 1, which contradicts the unique mode being 9. So, n=6 is invalid as well.

Wait, maybe 9 appears twice. Then the remaining four numbers sum to 30 - 18=12. So, we need four positive integers that sum to 12, with no number appearing more than once (since 9 is already the mode appearing twice). Wait, but if 9 appears twice, then other numbers can appear at most once. So, the remaining four numbers must be distinct. Let's see: 1,2,3,6. Sum is 1+2+3+6=12. So, the list would be [1,2,3,6,9,9]. Sorted: [1,2,3,6,9,9]. Median is average of third and fourth numbers: (3 +6)/2=4.5. But the median must be an integer. So, this doesn't work.

Alternatively, maybe the remaining four numbers are 1,2,4,5. Sum is 12. Then the list is [1,2,4,5,9,9]. Sorted: [1,2,4,5,9,9]. Median is (4 +5)/2=4.5. Not integer. Still invalid.

Alternatively, maybe 1,3,4,4. But then 4 appears twice, which would make 4 a mode as well, which is not allowed. So, can't do that.

Alternatively, 2,3,3,4. Again, 3 appears twice. Not allowed. Hmm.

Alternatively, 1,2,2,7. But 2 appears twice. So, the mode would be 2 and 9? No, 9 appears twice, 2 appears twice. So, there is a tie for mode, which contradicts the unique mode condition.

Alternatively, 1,2,3,6. As before. But median is 4.5. Not integer.

Alternatively, maybe 1,2,5,4. Same as before. No.

Wait, maybe the remaining four numbers are 2,2,3,5. But that would have 2 appearing twice, so mode would be 9 and 2. Not allowed.

Alternatively, 1,1,5,5. But same issue. So, seems like with n=6, even if 9 appears twice, the remaining numbers can't be arranged in such a way that the median is an integer not in the list. Because the median is the average of the third and fourth numbers, which in a sorted list of six numbers, would require that (third + fourth) is even. But with the remaining four numbers summing to 12, and all being distinct positive integers, is that possible?

Wait, let's try another combination. Suppose the remaining four numbers are 1,3,4,4. But that duplicates 4. So, not allowed. 1,3,5,3. Duplicates 3. 2,3,4,3. Duplicates 3. Hmm.

Alternatively, 1,2,4,5. Sum is 12. Sorted list: [1,2,4,5,9,9]. Median is (4 +5)/2=4.5. Not integer. So, invalid.

Alternatively, 1,3,4,4. But duplicates. 2,3,3,4. Duplicates. 1,2,3,6. Sum 12. Sorted list: [1,2,3,6,9,9]. Median (3 +6)/2=4.5. Not integer. So, no luck.

Alternatively, 2,2,3,5. Sum 12. Sorted list: [2,2,3,5,9,9]. But then mode is 2 and 9. Not allowed.

Alternatively, 1,4,4,3. Duplicates. 1,2,5,4. Same as before. Hmm.

So, seems like n=6 is impossible. Let's try n=8. Then the list has eight numbers, sum 30. Mode is 9, so 9 appears at least twice. Let's say 9 appears three times. Then the remaining five numbers sum to 30 - 27=3. But five positive integers summing to 3: only possible as 1,1,1,0,0. But zeros are not allowed. So, invalid.

Alternatively, 9 appears four times. Then remaining four numbers sum to 30 - 36= -6. Not possible.

Alternatively, 9 appears twice. Then remaining six numbers sum to 12. Each must be at least 1. Let's try to find six distinct positive integers summing to 12. The minimal sum is 1+2+3+4+5+6=21, which is way more than 12. So, impossible. So, n=8 is invalid.

Alternatively, if 9 appears three times. Then remaining five numbers sum to 30 - 27=3. Five numbers summing to 3: only possible with four 1s and one -1, which is invalid. So, n=8 is invalid.

Hmm, seems like n=4 and n=6 and n=8 are all invalid. Wait, maybe n=5? Wait, earlier I thought n must be even because the median is a single number. Wait, let's check that again.

The median is the average of the two middle numbers when n is even. If the median is an integer, then (a + b)/2 is integer, so a + b is even. So, a and b must be both even or both odd. But the median is not in the list. So, (a + b)/2 is not in the list. So, the list must have an even number of elements. Because if n were odd, the median would be the middle element, which would have to be in the list. But the problem states that the median is not in the list. So, n must be even. Therefore, n is even. So, n=2,4,6,8,...

But n=2: sum is 30. If the list is [a, b], with a + b =30. The mode is 9, which must appear at least twice. But n=2, so 9 must appear twice. So, list is [9,9], sum is 18. But we need sum 30. So, impossible. So, n=2 is invalid.

n=4: sum 30. Mode 9, appearing at least twice. Let's see. If 9 appears twice, then remaining two numbers sum to 12. They have to be distinct if 9 is the unique mode. So, let's have numbers 9,9,x,y with x + y =12, x ≠ y, and x,y ≠9. Then the sorted list would be [x, y,9,9] or [x,9,9,y], depending on x and y. The median is (x +9)/2 if x <9 or (9 +9)/2=9 if x >=9. Wait, no. If n=4, sorted list is [a,b,c,d], with a ≤ b ≤ c ≤ d. The median is (b + c)/2. So, if the list is [x,y,9,9], sorted, then b and c would be y and 9. So, median is (y +9)/2. This must be integer, so y +9 is even, so y is odd. Also, (y +9)/2 must not be in the list. So, (y +9)/2 ≠ x, y,9. Since x is the first element, which is ≤ y. Let's try to find such x and y.

x + y =12, x ≤ y, x and y positive integers. Also, y must be odd (since y +9 is even). So, possible y values: 1,3,5,7,9,11. But since x + y=12, if y=11, x=1. If y=9, x=3. y=7, x=5. y=5, x=7. y=3, x=9. But x must be ≤ y, so y=11, x=1; y=9, x=3; y=7, x=5; y=5, x=7. But for y=5, x=7, but x must be ≤ y, so x=7, y=5 is invalid. So, possible pairs:

1. y=11, x=1: list is [1,11,9,9]. Sorted: [1,9,9,11]. Median is (9 +9)/2=9. But 9 is in the list. So, invalid.

2. y=9, x=3: list is [3,9,9,9]. But mode is 9, appearing three times, but then 3 appears once. However, this would make the median (9 +9)/2=9, which is in the list. So, invalid.

3. y=7, x=5: list is [5,7,9,9]. Sorted: [5,7,9,9]. Median is (7 +9)/2=8. 8 is not in the list. Also, check if 9 is the unique mode. 9 appears twice, 5 and 7 appear once. So, yes, unique mode. Also, median 8 is not in the list. Sum is 5 +7 +9 +9=30. Perfect. So, this works. Therefore, the list is [5,7,9,9]. Wait, but sorted, it's [5,7,9,9]. The median is (7 +9)/2=8, which is not in the list. Mode is 9, unique. Sum is 30. Perfect.

So, n=4 is possible. Wait, but earlier when I considered n=4, I thought that the median was 9, but that was a mistake. Wait, in the list [5,7,9,9], the median is (7 +9)/2=8, which is correct. So, this works. So, the sum of squares is 5² +7² +9² +9²=25 +49 +81 +81=256. But let's check if there are other possibilities.

4. y=5, x=7: but x=7, y=5, which is invalid because x must be ≤ y. So, only y=11,9,7. So, the only valid case is y=7, x=5.

Therefore, the list is [5,7,9,9], sum of squares 25 +49 +81 +81=256. Wait, but let me check again. 5² is 25, 7² is 49, 9² is 81 twice. So, 25 +49=74, 81 +81=162, total 236. Wait, 25 +49 +81 +81=256? Wait, 25 +49 is 74, 81 +81 is 162, 74 +162=236. Yes, 236. Wait, but earlier I thought 25 +49 +81 +81=256. But 25 +49 is 74, 81 +81 is 162, 74 +162=236. So, the sum of squares is 236.

But let's confirm. 5²=25, 7²=49, 9²=81, 9²=81. 25+49=74, 81+81=162. 74+162=236. So, 236 is the sum of squares. So, that's one possible case.

But wait, are there other possibilities for n=4? Let's check. Suppose the list is [a, b, c, d], sorted, with a ≤ b ≤ c ≤ d. The median is (b + c)/2, which is an integer not in the list. The sum a + b + c + d=30. The mode is 9, appearing at least twice. So, 9 must appear at least twice. Let's see if there are other possibilities.

Suppose the list is [9,9, x, y], with x + y=12. If x and y are both greater than 9, then sorted list is [9,9,x,y]. Then the median is (9 + x)/2. Wait, but if x >9, then (9 +x)/2 would be greater than 9, which is in the list. So, median would be (9 +x)/2, which is not in the list. But if x >9, then (9 +x)/2 could be a new number not in the list. Let's check.

Suppose x=10, then y=2. But y must be ≥x=10? Wait, no. If sorted list is [9,9,10,2], which can't be because 2 <9. So, sorted list would be [2,9,9,10]. Then the median is (9 +9)/2=9, which is in the list. So, invalid.

Alternatively, x=11, y=1. Sorted list [1,9,9,11], median (9 +9)/2=9, which is in the list. So, invalid.

Alternatively, x=8, y=4. Then sorted list [4,8,9,9]. Median (8 +9)/2=8.5, which is not integer. So, invalid.

Alternatively, x=7, y=5. Then sorted list [5,7,9,9]. Median (7 +9)/2=8, which is not in the list. So, this is the case we already considered.

Alternatively, x=6, y=6. Then sorted list [6,6,9,9]. But then the mode is 6 and 9, each appearing twice. So, not unique mode. Invalid.

Alternatively, x=10, y=2. As before, sorted list [2,9,9,10], median 9, which is in the list.

So, seems like the only possible case for n=4 is [5,7,9,9], sum of squares 25 +49 +81 +81=236.

But wait, let's check another case. Suppose the list has more numbers. For example, n=6. Let me check again.

Wait, earlier, n=6 seemed problematic, but let's try again. Suppose the list has six numbers, sum 30, mode 9. Let's say 9 appears twice. Then remaining four numbers sum to 12. All four numbers must be distinct, as 9 is the unique mode. Let's see if there's a combination where the median is an integer not in the list.

Suppose the four numbers are 1,2,3,6. Sum is 12. Then the list is [1,2,3,6,9,9]. Sorted. Median is (3 +6)/2=4.5. Not integer. Invalid.

Alternatively, four numbers 1,2,4,5. Sum 12. Sorted list [1,2,4,5,9,9]. Median (4 +5)/2=4.5. Invalid.

Alternatively, four numbers 1,3,4,4. Sum 12. But duplicates 4. So, invalid.

Alternatively, four numbers 2,3,3,4. Sum 12. Duplicates 3. Invalid.

Alternatively, four numbers 1,2,5,4. Same as before.

Alternatively, four numbers 2,2,3,5. Duplicates 2. Invalid.

Alternatively, four numbers 1,4,5,2. Same as before.

Alternatively, four numbers 1,1,5,5. Duplicates 1 and 5. Invalid.

Alternatively, four numbers 3,3,3,3. Sum 12. But duplicates 3. Mode becomes 3 and 9, which is not allowed.

Alternatively, four numbers 12,0,0,0. But zeros not allowed.

Alternatively, four numbers 10,1,0,1. But zeros not allowed.

It seems impossible to find four distinct positive integers summing to 12 that don't include numbers that would make the median an integer in the list. So, n=6 is invalid.

So, the only possible list is n=4, with elements [5,7,9,9], sum of squares 25 +49 +81 +81=236. Therefore, the answer is 236.

But wait, let me check once more. Suppose the list is [5,7,9,9]. Sum is 5+7+9+9=30. Correct. Mode is 9, appears twice. Unique mode since 5 and 7 appear once. Median is (7 +9)/2=8, which is not in the list. Correct. So, all conditions are satisfied. Sum of squares is 25 +49 +81 +81=236.

Is there another possible list? Let's see. Suppose the list is [x, y,9,9], with x + y=12. We need x and y to be distinct, not 9, and the median (y +9)/2 not in the list.

If x=6, y=6. Then list is [6,6,9,9]. Mode is 6 and 9. Not unique. Invalid.

If x=4, y=8. Then list is [4,8,9,9]. Sorted. Median (8 +9)/2=8.5. Not integer. Invalid.

If x=3, y=9. But y=9. Then list is [3,9,9,9]. Mode is 9, appearing three times. But median is (9 +9)/2=9, which is in the list. Invalid.

If x=2, y=10. Then list [2,10,9,9]. Sorted [2,9,9,10]. Median (9 +9)/2=9, which is in the list. Invalid.

If x=1, y=11. Sorted [1,9,9,11]. Median (9 +9)/2=9, in the list. Invalid.

Therefore, only possible case is x=5, y=7. So, the list is [5,7,9,9]. So, sum of squares is 25 +49 +81 +81=236.

Therefore, the answer is 236.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{236}
Therefore, the sum of the squares of all the items in the list is $\boxed{236}$.
