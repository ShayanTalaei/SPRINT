Okay, so I need to find the probability that when each vertex of a regular octagon is colored red or blue independently with equal probability, the octagon can be rotated such that all blue vertices end up on positions where there were originally red vertices. Then express this probability as a reduced fraction m/n and find m + n. 

First, let me understand the problem. We have a regular octagon, so 8 vertices. Each vertex is colored red or blue, each with probability 1/2, independently. Then we can rotate the octagon (by some number of positions) such that all blue vertices are moved to positions that were originally red. So essentially, after rotation, the blue vertices can't end up in any position where there was a blue vertex before rotation. Wait, no. The problem says "all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices." So, after rotation, every blue vertex is now in a position that was originally red. So, the blue vertices can't be in positions that were originally blue. So, the set of blue vertices after rotation must be a subset of the original red vertices. 

But the original vertices have red or blue. So, if we rotate the octagon, the colors stay with the vertices. So, for example, if we have a vertex that was originally red, after rotation, it's still the same vertex, but its color might have changed. Wait, but the problem says "the octagon can be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices." So, after rotation, the blue vertices are now on the original red vertices. So, the original red vertices must have blue vertices after rotation. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, the problem says "the octagon can be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices." So, the blue vertices, after rotation, are on vertices that were originally red. So, the original blue vertices are moved to original red positions, and original red vertices are moved to original blue positions? Wait, no. Wait, rotation is a permutation of the vertices. So, if you rotate the octagon by, say, k positions, each vertex moves to the position k steps away. So, if originally, vertex 1 was red, after rotation by k positions, vertex 1 would now have the color of vertex (1 - k) mod 8. So, the problem is that the set of blue vertices after rotation must be a subset of the original red vertices. 

Alternatively, the set of blue vertices must be fixed under rotation in some way. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. 

Suppose the original octagon has some red and blue vertices. After a rotation, the colors are permuted. The condition is that all the blue vertices after rotation are on positions that were originally red. So, the positions that were originally blue cannot have any blue vertices after rotation. So, the blue vertices after rotation must be a subset of the original red vertices. 

Therefore, for the coloring to satisfy the condition, there exists a rotation (i.e., a cyclic shift) such that the image of the blue vertices under this rotation is a subset of the original red vertices. 

So, in other words, there exists a k (the rotation amount) such that if you rotate the octagon by k positions, the set of blue vertices is mapped into the original red vertices. 

So, the original coloring has some blue vertices. Rotating by k would map some of them to original red vertices, and the rest would be mapped to original blue vertices. We need that all the rotated blue vertices are in original red positions. Therefore, the original blue vertices must be in positions that are in the same orbit under rotation. Hmm, maybe?

Alternatively, this problem is similar to counting colorings where the blue vertices form a union of orbits under some rotation. But since the rotation can be chosen, maybe the problem is equivalent to the blue vertices being a union of entire orbits. Wait, but the octagon is regular, so the orbits under rotation are the cyclic shifts. For example, if you rotate by 1 position, each vertex is in a single orbit of size 8. Wait, no. If the rotation is by 1 position, then each vertex is in an orbit of size equal to the order of the rotation. The order of rotation by 1 in an octagon is 8, so the entire octagon is a single orbit. Wait, but if we have a rotation by 2 positions, the orbits would be split into two cycles of length 4 each. Similarly, rotation by 4 positions would split into two cycles of length 2 each. Wait, no. Let me think. 

Wait, in group theory terms, the rotation group of the octagon is cyclic of order 8. The orbits under rotation by a generator of order d would have size 8/d. For example, rotation by 1 step: orbits of size 8. Rotation by 2 steps: orbits of size 4. Rotation by 3 steps: orbits of size 8, since 3 and 8 are coprime. Wait, no. Wait, the orbit size is the order of the rotation, which is the smallest k such that k * d ≡ 0 mod 8. So, for rotation by d steps, the orbit size is 8 / gcd(d,8). 

Yes, that's right. So, for a rotation by d steps, the number of orbits (cycles) is gcd(d,8), each of size 8 / gcd(d,8). So, for example:

- Rotation by 1 step: gcd(1,8)=1, so 1 orbit of size 8.

- Rotation by 2 steps: gcd(2,8)=2, so 2 orbits of size 4.

- Rotation by 3 steps: gcd(3,8)=1, so 1 orbit of size 8.

- Rotation by 4 steps: gcd(4,8)=4, so 4 orbits of size 2.

- Rotation by 5 steps: same as rotation by 3 steps (since 5 ≡ -3 mod 8), so gcd(5,8)=1, orbit size 8.

- Rotation by 6 steps: same as rotation by 2 steps (6 ≡ -2 mod 8), so gcd(6,8)=2, orbit size 4.

- Rotation by 7 steps: same as rotation by 1 step (7 ≡ -1 mod 8), so gcd(7,8)=1, orbit size 8.

- Rotation by 8 steps: identity, so each vertex is its own orbit.

Therefore, the possible rotation steps that can be used are those that divide 8. Wait, but in the problem, we can choose any rotation, not necessarily a generator. So, for example, if we rotate by 2 steps, then the coloring must satisfy that the blue vertices are a union of two cycles of size 4. But since we can choose any rotation, the problem is to find colorings where there exists some rotation (i.e., some divisor of 8) such that the blue vertices are a union of entire cycles under that rotation.

Therefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of colorings where the blue vertices form a union of entire orbits under some rotation. Then, the probability is that number divided by 2^8 = 256.

So, the key is to count the number of such colorings.

To compute this, we can use Burnside's lemma or inclusion-exclusion, but since the problem is about existence of a rotation, it's a bit tricky. Alternatively, we can model the problem as counting colorings where the blue vertices are invariant under some rotation. Wait, but the problem is about the existence of a rotation that maps blue vertices to original red vertices. So, more precisely, there exists a rotation such that the image of the blue set under the rotation is a subset of the original red set. 

Wait, original red set is the complement of the original blue set. So, after rotation, the blue set is a subset of the original red set. So, the rotated blue set is disjoint from the original blue set. Therefore, the original blue set is disjoint from its rotation image. So, the original blue set B satisfies that B ∩ σ(B) = ∅, where σ is the rotation.

But since σ is a rotation by k steps, the size of σ(B) is |B|. So, |B| + |σ(B)| ≤ 8, but since B and σ(B) are disjoint, |B| ≤ 4. Because if |B| > 4, then σ(B) would overlap with B. Wait, but since the octagon has 8 vertices, if |B| = 5, then σ(B) would have 5 vertices, so |B ∩ σ(B)| ≥ 5 + 5 - 8 = 2. So, overlap is inevitable if |B| ≥ 5. Therefore, the original blue set must have size at most 4. So, B can have 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 blue vertices. 

But even if |B| ≤ 4, it's not sufficient to guarantee that B and σ(B) are disjoint for some rotation σ. For example, if B is a single vertex, then for some rotations, σ(B) would overlap with B. Wait, no. If B is a single vertex, then σ(B) is another single vertex. So, unless σ is the identity, σ(B) would be different. So, if B is a single vertex, then there exists a rotation σ such that σ(B) is different. For example, if B is vertex 1, then rotating by 1 step would send B to vertex 2, which is different from B. So, in that case, B ∩ σ(B) = empty. Therefore, for any singleton B, there exists a rotation σ such that σ(B) is disjoint from B. Therefore, singleton B satisfies the condition. Similarly, for |B| = 2, perhaps. 

But wait, if B is two adjacent vertices, say vertices 1 and 2, then if we rotate by 1 step, σ(B) would be vertices 2 and 3. Then B ∩ σ(B) = {2}, which is non-empty. So, in this case, σ(B) and B are not disjoint. However, if we rotate by 2 steps, σ(B) would be vertices 3 and 4, which is disjoint from B. So, even if B is two adjacent vertices, there exists a rotation (by 2 steps) such that σ(B) is disjoint from B. Therefore, even for |B| = 2, there exists such a rotation. 

Wait, let's check. Suppose B = {1,2}. Rotate by 2 steps: σ(B) = {3,4}. So, B and σ(B) are disjoint. Therefore, this coloring would satisfy the condition. Similarly, if B is {1,3}, then rotating by 4 steps would send {1,3} to {5,7}, which is disjoint from {1,3}. Therefore, for any size of B up to 4, there exists a rotation such that σ(B) is disjoint from B. Therefore, all colorings with |B| ≤ 4 satisfy the condition. 

Wait, but what if B is a set of 4 vertices arranged in a square. For example, vertices 1,3,5,7. Then, if we rotate by 2 steps, σ(B) = {3,5,7,1}, which is the same as B. Therefore, B ∩ σ(B) = B, which is not disjoint. Similarly, rotating by 1 step: σ(B) = {2,4,6,8}, which is the complement of B. Therefore, σ(B) is the complement of B. So, B ∩ σ(B) = ∅. Therefore, even in this case, rotating by 1 step gives σ(B) = complement of B, so B ∩ σ(B) = ∅. Therefore, the condition is satisfied. 

Therefore, for any B with |B| ≤ 4, there exists a rotation such that σ(B) is disjoint from B. Therefore, the number of colorings that satisfy the condition is equal to the number of subsets B of the 8 vertices with |B| ≤ 4. But wait, no. Because for some colorings with |B| ≤ 4, there might not exist a rotation that maps B to a disjoint set. Wait, but earlier reasoning suggests that for any B with |B| ≤ 4, there exists a rotation such that σ(B) is disjoint from B. For example, if B is a single vertex, rotate by 1 step. If B is two adjacent vertices, rotate by 2 steps. If B is four vertices forming a square, rotate by 1 step. Wait, but if B is four vertices arranged as two separate pairs, say {1,2,5,6}, then rotating by 3 steps would send {1,2,5,6} to {4,5,8,1}, which overlaps with original B. Rotating by 4 steps would send {1,2,5,6} to {5,6,1,2}, which is the same as B. So, in this case, rotating by 3 steps gives σ(B) = {4,5,8,1}, which overlaps with B at 5 and 1. So, σ(B) is not disjoint. Rotating by 1 step: σ(B) = {2,3,6,7}, which overlaps with B at 2 and 6. Rotating by 2 steps: σ(B) = {3,4,7,8}, which overlaps with B at none. Wait, {3,4,7,8} and {1,2,5,6} are disjoint? Let's check: 3,4,7,8 vs 1,2,5,6. Yes, no overlap. Therefore, rotating by 2 steps would make σ(B) disjoint from B. Therefore, even for this B, there exists a rotation (rotating by 2 steps) that makes σ(B) disjoint from B. Therefore, the condition is satisfied. 

Therefore, perhaps all colorings with |B| ≤ 4 satisfy the condition. Therefore, the total number of such colorings would be the sum from k=0 to 4 of C(8, k). Then, the probability would be [C(8,0) + C(8,1) + C(8,2) + C(8,3) + C(8,4)] / 256. 

But wait, let's check for |B| = 4. Suppose B is {1,3,5,7}, which is the set of all odd vertices. Rotating by 1 step: σ(B) = {2,4,6,8}, which is disjoint from B. Therefore, condition is satisfied. Similarly, any B with |B| = 4 can be rotated by 1 step to the complement, which is also size 4. Therefore, for |B| = 4, there exists a rotation (rotating by 1 step) such that σ(B) is disjoint from B. Therefore, all colorings with |B| ≤ 4 satisfy the condition. 

Therefore, the total number of valid colorings is sum_{k=0}^4 C(8, k). Let's compute that:

C(8,0) = 1

C(8,1) = 8

C(8,2) = 28

C(8,3) = 56

C(8,4) = 70

Sum: 1 + 8 + 28 + 56 + 70 = 163

Therefore, the probability would be 163/256. Then, m = 163, n = 256. Are they coprime? Let's check GCD(163,256). 163 is a prime number? Let's check. 163 divided by 2, no. 3: 1+6+3=10, not divisible by 3. 5: ends with 3. 7: 163/7 ≈23.28. 11: 163/11≈14.8. 13: 163/13≈12.5. 17: 163/17≈9.58. So, 163 is prime. 256 is 2^8. So, GCD(163,256)=1. Therefore, m+n=163+256=419. 

But wait a second. Wait, this seems too straightforward. The problem says "the octagon can be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices". So, if the original octagon has some blue and red vertices, after rotation, all blue vertices are on original red positions. So, the set of blue vertices must be a subset of the original red vertices. Wait, but rotation is a permutation. So, if the original red vertices are R and blue vertices are B, after rotation by σ, the blue vertices are σ(B). The condition is that σ(B) is a subset of R. Therefore, σ(B) ⊆ R. 

But σ is a rotation (i.e., a cyclic permutation). Therefore, σ(B) is just a cyclic shift of B. Therefore, σ(B) must be a subset of R. Therefore, the original B must be a subset of σ^{-1}(R). But σ^{-1}(R) is just R shifted by -σ. So, for some shift, the entire B must lie within R shifted by that amount. 

Alternatively, the problem is equivalent to finding colorings where there exists a rotation σ such that σ(B) ⊆ R. Which is equivalent to B ⊆ σ^{-1}(R). Since σ^{-1}(R) is just R shifted by -σ. So, the problem is equivalent to colorings where B is a subset of some cyclic shift of R. 

But since R is the complement of B, this is equivalent to B being a subset of some cyclic shift of its complement. Therefore, B must be a subset of some cyclic shift of the complement of B. 

Alternatively, for a given B, there exists a rotation σ such that σ(B) ∩ B = ∅. Because if σ(B) is a subset of R, then σ(B) ∩ B = ∅. Therefore, the condition is that B and σ(B) are disjoint for some σ. 

Wait, but this is exactly the same as before. So, the condition is that B is such that there exists a rotation σ with σ(B) ∩ B = ∅. Therefore, the number of such B is equal to the number of subsets B with |B| ≤ 4, because for |B| > 4, as we saw earlier, it's impossible to have σ(B) disjoint from B. Wait, but in our previous reasoning, we saw that even for |B| = 4, there exists a σ such that σ(B) ∩ B = ∅. Therefore, the total number of such subsets is sum_{k=0}^4 C(8, k) = 163. Therefore, the probability is 163/256, and m + n = 163 + 256 = 419. 

But wait, the problem says "the octagon can be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices". So, another way to interpret it is that after rotation, the blue vertices are exactly the original red vertices. But that's not what it says. It says "all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices". So, they can be a subset, not necessarily all. Therefore, the blue vertices can be a subset of the original red vertices. Therefore, the condition is that there exists a rotation such that σ(B) ⊆ R. Which is equivalent to B ⊆ σ^{-1}(R). So, as we thought before. 

But in that case, even if |B| ≤ 4, but the specific arrangement of B might not allow such a rotation. Wait, but we saw that for |B| ≤ 4, there exists a rotation. For example, if |B| = 1, rotate by 1 step. If |B| = 2, perhaps rotate by 2 steps. If |B| = 3, rotate by 3 steps. If |B| = 4, rotate by 1 step. Therefore, regardless of the arrangement, as long as |B| ≤ 4, such a rotation exists. 

But what if the blue vertices are arranged in a way that for |B| = 4, rotating by 1 step doesn't work? Wait, if B is arranged as two pairs of opposite vertices, such as {1,5,2,6}, then rotating by 1 step would send B to {2,6,3,7}, which overlaps with B at 2 and 6. Rotating by 2 steps would send B to {3,7,4,8}, which overlaps with B at none. Therefore, even in this case, rotating by 2 steps gives σ(B) = {3,7,4,8}, which is disjoint from B. Therefore, condition is satisfied. 

Therefore, regardless of the arrangement of B, as long as |B| ≤4, there exists a rotation that sends B to a disjoint set. Therefore, the total number of such subsets is sum_{k=0}^4 C(8, k) = 163. Therefore, probability is 163/256. 

But wait, let's test a specific example. Suppose B is all 8 vertices. Then |B| =8. Then, for any rotation, σ(B) = B, so σ(B) ∩ B = B, which is not empty. Therefore, the condition is not satisfied. Similarly, if |B| =5, then as we saw earlier, σ(B) and B must overlap. Therefore, the reasoning seems correct. 

Therefore, the answer is 163/256, so m + n = 163 + 256 = 419. 

But let me check once again. Let's consider a specific case where B is four vertices arranged as a square. For example, B = {1,3,5,7}. Then, rotating by 1 step: σ(B) = {2,4,6,8}, which is disjoint from B. So, condition is satisfied. Similarly, if B is {1,2,3,4}, then rotating by 4 steps: σ(B) = {5,6,7,8}, which is disjoint from B. Therefore, condition is satisfied. 

Alternatively, if B is {1,2,5,6}, then rotating by 2 steps: σ(B) = {3,4,7,8}, which is disjoint from B. So, condition is satisfied. 

Therefore, all subsets B with |B| ≤4 satisfy the condition. Therefore, the number of valid colorings is 163. Hence, the probability is 163/256, so m + n = 419. 

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{419}$.
Therefore, the probability that the octagon can be rotated so that all blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\frac{163}{256}$. Thus, $m + n = 163 + 256 = 419$.

$\boxed{419}$
