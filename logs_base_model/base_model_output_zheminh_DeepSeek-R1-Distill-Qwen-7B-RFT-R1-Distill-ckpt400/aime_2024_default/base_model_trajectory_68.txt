Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this game with a stack of n tokens. Alice goes first, and each turn they can remove either 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. We need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 make it possible for Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First, this seems like a combinatorial game theory problem. I remember that in such games, the key is to determine the winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. A losing position is the opposite—no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win. So, in this case, we need to find all n where Bob is in a winning position, meaning that Alice is in a losing position when n is given.

Let me start by considering small values of n and see if I can find a pattern or a recurrence relation. Let's list out n from 1 to, say, 10, and mark whether each position is a winning (W) or losing (L) position.

n=1: Alice can take 1 token and win. So this is a winning position for Alice. But since we're looking for positions where Bob can win, this is an L position for Bob. Wait, no. Wait, the question is about Bob having a winning strategy. So if n=1, Alice takes the last token and wins. So for Bob to have a winning strategy, Alice must be in a losing position. So n=1 is a losing position for Bob because Alice can win immediately. Therefore, n=1 is not counted.

n=2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob can take the last token and win. Wait, but if Alice takes 1, Bob takes the last. So Alice's move leads to Bob winning. Alternatively, can Alice take 4 tokens? No, because there's only 2. So Alice can only take 1. So Bob can win. Therefore, n=2 is a winning position for Bob? Wait, but if Alice takes 1, Bob can take the last. So Bob wins. Therefore, n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning it's a winning position for Bob. So n=2 is counted.

Wait, maybe I need to clarify the terminology. Let's define positions where the current player can force a win as winning positions (W), and the others as losing positions (L). So if n is a W position, the current player can win; if L, the current player will lose if the opponent plays optimally.

Given that Alice goes first, we need to find all n where the starting position is L, meaning Bob can win. So n needs to be L positions for Alice. Therefore, we need to find all n where the position is L, i.e., Alice is in a losing position, so Bob can win.

So let's try to define W and L positions. Let's start with n=0: trivially, the game is over, so if there are 0 tokens, the last player to move has already won. So n=0 is a losing position? Wait, maybe not. Wait, in standard game theory, positions with 0 tokens are considered losing positions because you can't move. So if you're faced with 0 tokens, you lose. Therefore, the player who takes the last token wins. So the position with 1 token is a winning position because you can take it and win. The position with 2 tokens: if you take 1, you leave 1 for the opponent, who then takes it and wins. If you take 4, you can't. So n=2 is a losing position for the current player. Wait, hold on.

Wait, perhaps I need to start from the base cases and build up.

Let's define f(n) as the status of the position n: W or L. f(n) = W if the current player can win, L otherwise.

Base case: n=0. The player cannot move, so they lose. So f(0) = L.

n=1: current player can take 1 token and win. So f(1) = W.

n=2: current player can take 1 token, leaving 1 for the opponent, who then takes it and wins. Alternatively, can they take 4? No. So the only move is to take 1, leading to opponent's win. Therefore, f(2) = L.

n=3: current player can take 1 token, leaving 2. Since f(2) is L, the opponent is in a losing position. Therefore, current player can win by taking 1. So f(3) = W.

n=4: current player can take 1 token, leaving 3 (which is W for the opponent) or take 4 tokens and win. So since taking 4 tokens is an option, current player can win. So f(4) = W.

n=5: current player can take 1 token, leaving 4 (which is W for opponent), or take 4 tokens, leaving 1 (which is W for opponent). So both moves leave opponent in W positions. Therefore, f(5) = L.

n=6: current player can take 1 token, leaving 5 (L for opponent) or take 4 tokens, leaving 2 (L for opponent). So either move leaves opponent in L position. Therefore, current player can win. So f(6) = W.

Wait, hold on. If you take 1 token from 6, leaving 5 (L), so opponent is in L, which means opponent cannot win. Therefore, current player can win by taking 1. Similarly, taking 4 tokens from 6 leaves 2 (L), so opponent is in L. Either way, current player can win. Therefore, f(6) = W.

n=7: current player can take 1, leaving 6 (W), or take 4, leaving 3 (W). So both moves leave opponent in W positions. Therefore, f(7) = L.

n=8: current player can take 1, leaving 7 (L) or take 4, leaving 4 (W). If they take 1, opponent is in L, so current player can win. Therefore, f(8) = W.

n=9: current player can take 1, leaving 8 (W) or take 4, leaving 5 (L). If they take 4, opponent is in L, so current player can win. Therefore, f(9) = W.

n=10: current player can take 1, leaving 9 (W) or take 4, leaving 6 (W). Both moves leave opponent in W positions. Therefore, f(10) = L.

Wait, let's list these out:

n : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
f(n): L W L W W L W L W W L

Looking at this, the losing positions so far are n=0,2,5,7,10. Hmm, seems like every 3 numbers? Let's check the differences between losing positions:

From 0 to 2: +2

2 to 5: +3

5 to 7: +2

7 to 10: +3

So the pattern alternates between adding 2 and 3. Let's check if this continues.

n=11: current player can take 1, leaving 10 (L) or take 4, leaving 7 (L). Either move leaves opponent in L. Therefore, f(11)=W.

n=12: current player can take 1, leaving 11 (W) or take 4, leaving 8 (W). Both moves leave opponent in W. So f(12)=L.

n=13: take 1 to 12 (L) or take 4 to 9 (W). Taking 1 leaves L, so current player can win. f(13)=W.

n=14: take 1 to 13 (W) or take 4 to 10 (L). Taking 4 leaves L, so current player can win. f(14)=W.

n=15: take 1 to 14 (W) or take 4 to 11 (W). Both moves leave W. So f(15)=L.

So the losing positions up to n=15 are 0,2,5,7,10,12,15. The differences are 2,3,2,3,2,3. So the pattern is that losing positions occur every 2 and 3 alternately. So starting from 0, adding 2 to get 2, then +3 to get 5, then +2 to get 7, +3 to get 10, +2 to get 12, +3 to get 15, etc.

Therefore, the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 mod 5? Wait, 0,2,5,7,10,12,15. Let's check modulo 5:

0 mod5=0

2 mod5=2

5 mod5=0

7 mod5=2

10 mod5=0

12 mod5=2

15 mod5=0

So the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod5. Wait, 0 and 2 mod5. Let's check:

n=0: 0 mod5=0

n=2: 2 mod5=2

n=5: 5 mod5=0

n=7:7 mod5=2

n=10:10 mod5=0

n=12:12 mod5=2

n=15:15 mod5=0

Yes, so the losing positions are numbers where n ≡0 or 2 mod5. Therefore, the losing positions are n ≡0 or 2 mod5.

But let's check n=17. Following the pattern, n=15 is L, so n=16: take 1 to 15 (L), so current player can win. n=17: take 1 to 16 (W) or take 4 to 13 (W). Both moves leave opponent in W. So f(17)=L. 17 mod5=2. So yes, 17 is L. Similarly, n=18: take 1 to 17 (L), so current player can win. n=19: take 1 to 18 (W) or take 4 to 15 (L). Taking 4 leaves L, so current player can win. n=20: take 1 to 19 (W) or take 4 to 16 (W). Both moves leave W. So f(20)=L. 20 mod5=0. So yes, the pattern continues.

Therefore, the losing positions are n ≡0 or 2 mod5. Therefore, the positions where the current player (Alice) is in a losing position are n ≡0 or 2 mod5. Therefore, for Bob to have a winning strategy, the starting position (n) must be a losing position for Alice, which is n ≡0 or 2 mod5.

Therefore, the number of positive integers n ≤2024 where n ≡0 or 2 mod5 is the answer.

Wait, let's verify this. Let's check the earlier numbers. For example, n=5: 5 mod5=0. So according to the pattern, it's a losing position. Which matches our earlier calculation. Similarly, n=7:7 mod5=2, which is also a losing position. So this seems to hold.

Therefore, the total number of such n is equal to the number of integers ≤2024 congruent to 0 or 2 mod5.

To compute this, we can calculate how many numbers ≤2024 are ≡0 mod5 and how many are ≡2 mod5, then add them together.

First, numbers ≡0 mod5: these are 5,10,15,..., up to the largest multiple of 5 ≤2024.

Similarly, numbers ≡2 mod5: 2,7,12,..., up to the largest number ≤2024.

Let's compute the count for each.

For ≡0 mod5:

The sequence is 5,10,15,..., L, where L = floor(2024/5)*5. Let's compute 2024 divided by5: 2024 ÷5=404.8. So the largest multiple of5 ≤2024 is 5×404=2020. Therefore, the number of terms is 404.

For ≡2 mod5:

The sequence is 2,7,12,..., M, where M is the largest number ≤2024 such that M ≡2 mod5. Let's compute the largest such number.

The general term is 5k +2. Let's solve 5k +2 ≤2024. 5k ≤2022. k ≤2022/5=404.4. So k=404. Therefore, M=5×404 +2=2020 +2=2022. Therefore, the number of terms is 404 +1=405? Wait, wait. Wait, when k=0: 2, k=1:7,...,k=404:2022. So total terms is 405? Wait, from k=0 to k=404, inclusive, that's 405 terms. Wait, but 5k +2 with k=0 gives 2, which is within 1 to2024. So yes, 405 terms.

But wait, let's check. Let's take k=0: 2, k=1:7, ..., k=404:2022. So yes, 405 terms.

But wait, 2022=5×404 +2. So yes, that's correct.

Therefore, numbers ≡0 mod5:404 numbers.

Numbers ≡2 mod5:405 numbers.

Total:404 +405=809.

But wait, hold on. Let's check for n=2024. 2024 mod5=2024-5×404=2024-2020=4. So 2024≡4 mod5. So the last term for ≡0 mod5 is2020, and last term for ≡2 mod5 is2022.

But 2022 is less than2024, so all terms are accounted for. Therefore, the total is809.

But let me verify with another approach. The total numbers ≡0 mod5 from1 to2024: floor(2024/5)=404.8, so 404 terms.

Similarly, numbers ≡2 mod5: the first term is2, the last term is2022. The number of terms is ((2022 -2)/5) +1 = (2020/5)+1=404 +1=405.

Therefore, total numbers is404 +405=809.

Therefore, the answer is809.

But wait, let me check with another example. Let's take n=5: which is 5≡0 mod5. So according to the formula, it's counted. Similarly, n=7≡2 mod5 is counted. So the formula seems to hold.

But let me check for n=1. n=1≡1 mod5. It's a winning position for Alice, so Bob can't win. So not counted. n=2≡2 mod5: counted. n=3≡3 mod5: winning for Alice. n=4≡4 mod5: winning for Alice. n=5≡0 mod5: losing for Alice. So yes, the formula seems to hold.

Therefore, the number of n≤2024 where Bob can win is809.

But wait, let me check for n=2024. 2024≡4 mod5. So the last losing position for Bob would be2022≡2 mod5. So the count is correct.

Alternatively, another way to compute is total numbers ≡0 or2 mod5 up to2024.

Total numbers ≡0 mod5: floor(2024/5)=404.

Total numbers ≡2 mod5: floor((2024 -2)/5) +1. Wait, 2024-2=2022. 2022/5=404.4, so floor(404.4)=404. Then +1=405. So total 404 +405=809.

Yes, same result.

Therefore, the answer should be809.

But let me cross-verify with another approach. Let's note that in each block of5 consecutive numbers, there are exactly two losing positions: one ≡0 mod5 and one≡2 mod5. So in each block of5, there are2 losing positions. Therefore, total number of losing positions up to N is approximately (N/5)*2. For N=2024, which is5×404 +4. So number of complete blocks is404, each contributing2 losing positions, so404×2=808. Then, the remaining numbers are2021,2022,2023,2024. Among these,2021≡1 mod5,2022≡2 mod5,2023≡3 mod5,2024≡4 mod5. So only2022 is a losing position. Therefore, total losing positions=808 +1=809. So same result.

Therefore, the answer is809.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{809}
Therefore, the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play is \(\boxed{809}\).
