Okay, so I need to find the value of x + y given the two equations y³ = x² and (y - x)² = 4y². Let me start by understanding what these equations mean and how I can solve for x and y.

First, the equation y³ = x² relates x and y in a cubic manner. Since both x and y are positive real numbers, I don't have to worry about negative roots or anything like that. The second equation, (y - x)² = 4y², looks like a quadratic equation in terms of (y - x). Maybe I can take the square root of both sides to simplify it?

Let me try that. Taking the square root of both sides of (y - x)² = 4y² gives |y - x| = 2y. Since all numbers are positive, the absolute value can be split into two cases: y - x = 2y or y - x = -2y. But since y and x are positive, let's check each case.

Case 1: y - x = 2y. If I subtract y from both sides, I get -x = y, which would mean x = -y. But x and y are positive real numbers, so this case is impossible. Therefore, this case doesn't yield a valid solution.

Case 2: y - x = -2y. Adding 2y to both sides gives y + 2y - x = 0, so 3y - x = 0, which means x = 3y. Okay, so this is a valid relationship between x and y. So from the second equation, we have x = 3y.

Now, substitute x = 3y into the first equation y³ = x². Let's do that. So replacing x with 3y in the first equation gives y³ = (3y)². Calculating the right side, (3y)² is 9y². Therefore, the equation becomes y³ = 9y².

Now, let's solve for y. Subtract 9y² from both sides to get y³ - 9y² = 0. Factor out y²: y²(y - 9) = 0. Since y is a positive real number, y² can't be zero. Therefore, y - 9 = 0, so y = 9.

Now that we have y = 9, substitute back into x = 3y to find x. So x = 3*9 = 27. Therefore, x = 27 and y = 9. Then x + y = 27 + 9 = 36.

Wait, let me check if this satisfies both equations. First equation: y³ = 9³ = 729. x² = 27² = 729. So that works. Second equation: (y - x)² = (9 - 27)² = (-18)² = 324. 4y² = 4*(81) = 324. So that also works. So both equations are satisfied.

Therefore, the answer is 36. Hmm, seems straightforward. Let me just make sure there are no other solutions. In the second equation, when we took the square root, we considered both positive and negative cases, but only the negative case gave a valid solution because the positive case led to x being negative, which isn't allowed. So there's only one solution here. Therefore, x + y is 36.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{36}
Thus, $x + y = \boxed{36}$.
