Okay, let's see. I need to find the units digit of the sum of the 2023 numbers in the 2023rd row of this triangular array. The problem describes how each row is formed: starting with 1s at the ends, and each interior entry is 1 greater than the sum of the two numbers diagonally above it from the previous row. The first five rows are given, so maybe I can find a pattern or a formula here.

First, let me try to understand how the rows are constructed. The first row is just [1]. The second row is [1, 1]. The third row is [1, 3, 1]. The fourth row is [1, 5, 5, 1], and the fifth row is [1, 7, 11, 7, 1]. Let me check if I can see how each row is built.

Starting with the first row: [1]. Then for the second row, we add 1s at both ends. For the third row, the middle number is 3. Let's see how that comes from the second row. The two numbers diagonally above would be the first and second numbers of the previous row, which are 1 and 1. Their sum is 2, then add 1 to get 3. So the middle entry is 3. Then the fourth row: starting and ending with 1, then the next entries. For the second entry in the fourth row, it's 5. How is that calculated? The two numbers diagonally above would be the first and second numbers of the third row: 1 and 3. Their sum is 4, add 1 to get 5. The third entry in the fourth row is also 5. How is that calculated? Diagonally above would be the second and third numbers of the third row: 3 and 1. Their sum is 4, add 1 to get 5. Then the fifth row: starting and ending with 1, then 7, 11, 7. Let's check the third entry in the fifth row: diagonally above would be the second and third numbers of the fourth row: 5 and 5. Their sum is 10, add 1 to get 11. The fourth entry is 7, which comes from the third and fourth numbers of the fourth row: 5 and 1. Their sum is 6, add 1 to get 7.

Okay, so the rule is clear. Each interior number is 1 plus the sum of the two numbers diagonally above it. So, for row n, the entries are built from row n-1.

Now, the question is about the sum of the numbers in the 2023rd row. The problem asks for the units digit of that sum. So maybe I don't need the exact sum, just the last digit. But to find that, I might need a pattern or formula for the sum of each row.

Let me compute the sums of the given rows to see if there's a pattern.

Row 1: 1 → sum = 1

Row 2: 1, 1 → sum = 2

Row 3: 1, 3, 1 → sum = 5

Row 4: 1, 5, 5, 1 → sum = 12

Row 5: 1, 7, 11, 7, 1 → sum = 27

Hmm. Let's list the sums: 1, 2, 5, 12, 27.

Looking at these numbers: 1, 2, 5, 12, 27. Let's see the differences between consecutive terms:

2 - 1 = 1

5 - 2 = 3

12 - 5 = 7

27 - 12 = 15

So the differences are 1, 3, 7, 15. These numbers look familiar. 1, 3, 7, 15... Each is one less than a power of 2: 2, 4, 8, 16. So 2 - 1 = 1, 4 - 1 = 3, 8 - 1 = 7, 16 - 1 = 15. So the differences between the sums are 2^n - 1, starting from n=1.

So if the difference between the sum of row n and row n-1 is 2^{n-1} - 1, then the sum of row n would be the sum of row n-1 plus 2^{n-1} - 1.

Let's test this. For row 2: sum = 2. According to the formula, sum of row 2 = sum of row 1 + 2^{2-1} - 1 = 1 + 2 - 1 = 2. Correct.

Sum of row 3: sum of row 2 + 2^{3-1} - 1 = 2 + 4 - 1 = 5. Correct.

Sum of row 4: 5 + 8 - 1 = 12. Correct.

Sum of row 5: 12 + 16 - 1 = 27. Correct.

So the general formula for the sum of row n is sum(n) = sum(n-1) + 2^{n-1} - 1.

If this pattern continues, then the sum of row n can be expressed as a cumulative sum:

sum(n) = sum(1) + sum_{k=2 to n} (2^{k-1} - 1) = 1 + sum_{k=2 to n} 2^{k-1} - sum_{k=2 to n} 1.

Simplify this:

sum(n) = 1 + (sum_{k=1 to n-1} 2^k) - (n - 1).

Because sum_{k=2 to n} 2^{k-1} is the same as sum_{k=1 to n-1} 2^k, which is a geometric series.

The sum of a geometric series sum_{k=1 to m} 2^k = 2^{m+1} - 2. So here, m = n - 1, so sum_{k=1 to n-1} 2^k = 2^{n} - 2.

Therefore, sum(n) = 1 + (2^{n} - 2) - (n - 1) = 1 + 2^n - 2 - n + 1 = 2^n - n.

So the sum of the nth row is 2^n - n.

Wait, let's check this formula with the known sums.

For row 1: 2^1 - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1. Correct.

Row 2: 2^2 - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2. Correct.

Row 3: 8 - 3 = 5. Correct.

Row 4: 16 - 4 = 12. Correct.

Row 5: 32 - 5 = 27. Correct.

Perfect, that's accurate. So the formula for the sum of the nth row is 2^n - n.

Therefore, the sum of the 2023rd row is 2^{2023} - 2023. The problem asks for the units digit of this sum. So we need to compute (2^{2023} - 2023) mod 10.

To find the units digit, we can compute each term modulo 10 and then subtract.

First, compute 2^{2023} mod 10. Then compute 2023 mod 10. Then subtract the two results and take modulo 10 again if necessary.

Let's start with 2023 mod 10. That's easy: 2023 divided by 10 is 202 with a remainder of 3. So 2023 mod 10 = 3.

Now, 2^{2023} mod 10. To compute this, we can use the fact that the units digit of powers of 2 cycles every 4. The cycle is 2, 4, 8, 6, 2, 4, 8, 6, etc. So the cycle length is 4. Therefore, 2^1 mod 10 = 2, 2^2 = 4, 2^3 = 8, 2^4 = 6, 2^5 = 2, and so on.

So to find 2^{2023} mod 10, we can find 2023 mod 4. Because the cycle repeats every 4. Let's compute 2023 divided by 4. 4*505 = 2020, so 2023 - 2020 = 3. Therefore, 2023 mod 4 = 3. Therefore, 2^{2023} mod 10 is the same as 2^3 mod 10 = 8.

Therefore, 2^{2023} mod 10 = 8.

Now, 2023 mod 10 = 3.

Therefore, (2^{2023} - 2023) mod 10 = (8 - 3) mod 10 = 5 mod 10 = 5.

Wait, so the units digit is 5? Let me check again.

Wait, but when subtracting modulo 10, if the first term is smaller than the second, we need to adjust. For example, if we have (a - b) mod 10, if a < b, then it's equivalent to (a - b + 10) mod 10. But in this case, 8 - 3 = 5, which is positive, so 5 mod 10 is 5. So units digit is 5. So the answer should be 5.

But let me verify this again step by step.

First, confirm the formula for the sum of the nth row. Let's see:

We derived that sum(n) = 2^n - n. For n=1 to 5, it's correct. Let's check n=6: according to the pattern, the sum of row 6 would be 2^6 - 6 = 64 - 6 = 58. Let's see if that's consistent with the construction.

Row 6: starts and ends with 1. The interior entries are each 1 greater than the sum of the two numbers diagonally above. Let's compute the fifth row: [1, 7, 11, 7, 1]

So row 6 would have 7 numbers. Let's compute each entry:

First entry: 1

Second entry: 1 + (1 + 7) + 1? Wait, no. Wait, the rule is each interior entry is 1 greater than the sum of the two numbers diagonally above. So for the second entry in row 6, it's diagonally above the first and second entries of row 5, which are 1 and 7. Their sum is 8, plus 1 is 9. Third entry: diagonally above 7 and 11, sum is 18, plus 1 is 19. Fourth entry: diagonally above 11 and 7, sum is 18, plus 1 is 19. Fifth entry: diagonally above 7 and 1, sum is 8, plus 1 is 9. Sixth entry: 1.

So row 6: [1, 9, 19, 19, 9, 1]

Sum: 1 + 9 + 19 + 19 + 9 + 1 = 1 + 9 = 10, 10 + 19 = 29, 29 +19=48, 48+9=57, 57+1=58. Which matches 2^6 -6 = 64 -6=58. So the formula holds.

Therefore, the formula is correct.

Therefore, for row 2023, sum = 2^{2023} - 2023.

We need the units digit of this sum. As computed:

2^{2023} mod 10 = 8

2023 mod 10 = 3

So 8 - 3 = 5.

Therefore, the units digit is 5.

But just to make sure, let's think again about the formula. The sum(n) = 2^n -n. Therefore, the units digit is (2^n -n) mod 10.

We computed 2^2023 mod 10 as 8, 2023 mod 10 as 3, so 8 -3 =5. Since 5 is positive, the units digit is 5.

Alternatively, if we had a case where 2^n mod10 was less than n mod10, we would need to add 10. For example, if 2^n mod10 was 2 and n mod10 was 5, then 2 -5 = -3, so (-3 +10)=7. But in this case, 8 -3 =5, so no need.

Therefore, the answer is 5.

But let me check with another row. For example, row 6: sum=58, units digit 8. According to formula: 2^6 -6=64-6=58. Correct.

Another test: row 7. Sum should be 2^7 -7=128 -7=121. Let's check the construction.

Row 7: starts and ends with 1. The interior entries:

Second entry: diagonally above 1 and 9 (from row 6), sum 10 +1=11.

Third entry: diagonally above 9 and 19 (from row 6), sum 28 +1=29.

Fourth entry: diagonally above 19 and19, sum 38 +1=39.

Fifth entry: diagonally above 19 and9, sum 28 +1=29.

Sixth entry: diagonally above 9 and1, sum 10 +1=11.

So row7: [1,11,29,39,29,11,1]

Sum: 1 +11=12, +29=41, +39=80, +29=109, +11=120, +1=121. Correct. So formula holds.

Therefore, confident that the formula is correct.

Therefore, the answer is 5.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{5}
Therefore, the units digit of the sum of the 2023 numbers in the 2023rd row is $\boxed{5}$.
