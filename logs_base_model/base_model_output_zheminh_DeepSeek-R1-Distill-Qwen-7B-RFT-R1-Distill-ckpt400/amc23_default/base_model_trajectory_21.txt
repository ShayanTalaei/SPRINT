Okay, so I need to find the positive difference between the x-coordinates of points A and B on the graph of y = log₂x. The midpoint of segment AB is given as (6, 2). The final answer should be in the form m√n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n. Let me start by recalling some basics.

First, since both A and B are on the graph of y = log₂x, their coordinates must satisfy this equation. Let me denote point A as (a, log₂a) and point B as (b, log₂b). The midpoint of AB would then be the average of their x-coordinates and the average of their y-coordinates. The midpoint formula is ((a + b)/2, (log₂a + log₂b)/2). According to the problem, this midpoint is (6, 2). 

So, I can set up two equations based on the midpoint coordinates. The x-coordinate of the midpoint is (a + b)/2 = 6, which implies that a + b = 12. The y-coordinate of the midpoint is (log₂a + log₂b)/2 = 2, so log₂a + log₂b = 4. 

Now, I have two equations:

1. a + b = 12
2. log₂a + log₂b = 4

I need to solve these equations to find a and b, then compute |a - b|. Let me see how to approach the second equation. The sum of logs is the log of the product, so log₂(ab) = 4. That means ab = 2⁴ = 16. 

So now, I have a system of equations:

a + b = 12

ab = 16

This looks like a quadratic equation problem. If I let a and b be the roots of the quadratic equation x² - (a + b)x + ab = 0, then the equation is x² - 12x + 16 = 0. Let me solve this quadratic.

Using the quadratic formula: x = [12 ± √(144 - 64)] / 2 = [12 ± √80] / 2. Simplify √80: √(16*5) = 4√5. So, x = [12 ± 4√5]/2 = 6 ± 2√5. 

Therefore, the x-coordinates are 6 + 2√5 and 6 - 2√5. The positive difference between them is (6 + 2√5) - (6 - 2√5) = 4√5. 

So, the positive difference is 4√5. The problem states that this can be written as m√n where m and n are relatively prime. Here, m is 4 and n is 5. Since 4 and 5 are coprime, m + n = 4 + 5 = 9. 

Wait, but let me double-check my steps to ensure there's no mistake. 

First, the midpoint calculation: yes, (a + b)/2 = 6 implies a + b = 12. The log sum: log₂a + log₂b = log₂(ab) = 4, so ab = 16. Correct. 

Then, quadratic equation: x² -12x +16=0. Discriminant: 144 - 64 = 80. √80 is 4√5. Solutions: (12 ± 4√5)/2 = 6 ± 2√5. Difference is 4√5. Then m=4, n=5, sum is 9. 

Wait, but let me verify if the points actually lie on the graph. Let's take a = 6 + 2√5, then log₂a = log₂(6 + 2√5). Similarly for b = 6 - 2√5. The midpoint y-coordinate should be 2. Let's compute (log₂a + log₂b)/2. Since log₂a + log₂b = log₂(ab) = log₂16 = 4, so dividing by 2 gives 2. Correct. 

So the midpoint is indeed (6, 2). Therefore, all steps check out. The answer is 4√5, so m + n is 9. 

But just to be thorough, let me check the arithmetic again. Quadratic equation: x² -12x +16=0. Using the quadratic formula: [12 ± √(144 - 64)] / 2 = [12 ± √80]/2 = [12 ± 4√5]/2 = 6 ± 2√5. Yes. Then difference is 4√5. 

Alternatively, is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using substitution or logarithmic properties. Let's see. 

Suppose a and b are such that a + b = 12 and ab = 16. Then, the positive difference |a - b| can be found using the formula |a - b| = √[(a + b)² - 4ab]. Let's compute that. 

(a + b)² = 144, 4ab = 64. So (a + b)² - 4ab = 144 - 64 = 80. Therefore, |a - b| = √80 = 4√5. So same result. 

Yes, that's another way to get the difference without solving for a and b. So that confirms the answer. 

Therefore, the positive difference is 4√5, and m + n is 9. 

**Final Answer**
\boxed{9}
Therefore, the positive difference between the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ is $4\sqrt{5}$, so $m+n = 4+5 = \boxed{9}$.
