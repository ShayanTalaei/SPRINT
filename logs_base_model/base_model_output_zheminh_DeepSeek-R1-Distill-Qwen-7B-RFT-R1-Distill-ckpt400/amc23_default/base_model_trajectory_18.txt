Okay, let's try to figure out how many positive perfect squares less than 2023 are divisible by 5. Hmm, where do I start?

First, I know that a perfect square is a number that's the square of an integer. So, numbers like 1, 4, 9, 16, etc. Now, the question is asking for those perfect squares that are divisible by 5 and are less than 2023. 

Wait, if a perfect square is divisible by 5, that means the original number (before squaring) must have 5 as one of its prime factors. Because 5 is a prime number, right? So, if n² is divisible by 5, then n itself must be divisible by 5. Let me check that. If n is divisible by 5, then n = 5k for some integer k. Then, n² = (5k)² = 25k², which is clearly divisible by 5. Conversely, if n² is divisible by 5, then 5 divides n², which implies 5 divides n (since 5 is prime). So, that's a good point. Therefore, the perfect squares divisible by 5 are exactly the squares of multiples of 5. So, the numbers we're looking for are (5k)² where k is a positive integer. 

So, the problem reduces to finding all k such that (5k)² < 2023. Let me write that out:

(5k)² < 2023  
25k² < 2023  
k² < 2023 / 25  
k² < 80.92

So, k must be a positive integer such that k² is less than 80.92. Therefore, k can be 1, 2, 3, ..., up to the largest integer whose square is less than 80.92. Let's find that.

Calculating the square root of 80.92. Let's see, 9² is 81, which is just a bit more than 80.92. So, sqrt(80.92) is approximately 8.995, which is just under 9. So, the largest integer k is 8, because 8² is 64, and 9² is 81, which is greater than 80.92. Therefore, k can be 1 through 8. 

Wait, but let me verify that. Let's compute 25*(8)^2. 25*64 is 1600, which is definitely less than 2023. Then 25*(9)^2 is 25*81=2025, which is just over 2023. So, 2025 is greater than 2023, so k=9 is too big. Therefore, k can be from 1 to 8. 

Therefore, there are 8 such perfect squares. But wait, let me check again. The original problem says "positive perfect squares less than 2023". So, we need to check if (5k)² is less than 2023. So, k can be 1 to 8. Therefore, the answer is 8. 

But hold on, let me make sure I didn't skip any steps. Let's re-examine:

1. A perfect square divisible by 5 must be the square of a multiple of 5. So, numbers of the form (5k)².
2. Find all k where (5k)² < 2023.
3. Simplify the inequality: 25k² < 2023 → k² < 80.92.
4. The largest integer k is 8, since 8²=64 <80.92 and 9²=81>80.92.
5. Therefore, k can be 1 through 8, inclusive. That gives 8 numbers.

But let's check each k from 1 to 8:

k=1: 5*1=5, square is 25. 25<2023? Yes.
k=2: 10²=100. 100<2023. Yes.
k=3: 15²=225. Yes.
k=4: 20²=400. Yes.
k=5:25²=625. Yes.
k=6:30²=900. Yes.
k=7:35²=1225. Yes.
k=8:40²=1600. Yes.
k=9:45²=2025. 2025>2023. So, stop here.

So, 8 numbers. Therefore, the answer is 8. 

But wait, just to be thorough, let's check if 1600 is indeed less than 2023. 1600 is way less. 2025 is 2025-2023=2 more, so yes, 2025 is too big. So, 8 is correct. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another approach. Let's think: how many squares less than 2023 are divisible by 5. Since squares divisible by 5 must be multiples of 25. So, the squares divisible by 5 are the squares of multiples of 5. Therefore, the squares divisible by 5 and less than 2023 are the squares of 5, 10, 15, ..., up to the largest multiple of 5 whose square is less than 2023. 

So, the largest multiple of 5 less than sqrt(2023). Let me compute sqrt(2023). Let's see, 45²=2025, which is 2 more than 2023. So, sqrt(2023) is slightly less than 45, about 44.98. Therefore, the largest multiple of 5 less than 44.98 is 40 (since 45 is 45, which is over). So, multiples of 5: 5,10,...,40. How many terms is that?

The sequence is 5,10,...,40. The nth term is 5n. So, 5n ≤40 → n ≤8. Therefore, n=1 to 8. So, 8 terms. Hence, 8 squares. 

So, same result. Therefore, the answer is 8. 

Therefore, after thorough checking, the answer is 8.
Therefore, the number of positive perfect squares less than $2023$ that are divisible by $5$ is $\boxed{8}$.
