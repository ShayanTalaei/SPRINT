Okay, let's try to figure out this table tennis tournament problem. So, every participant played every other participant exactly once. That means if there are, say, n players, each plays n-1 games. Since every game is between two players, the total number of games is n(n-1)/2. But we need to find n, right? Or maybe we can find n using the other information given.

The problem states there were twice as many right-handed players as left-handed players. Let me denote the number of left-handed players as L and right-handed players as R. So, R = 2L. That means the total number of players is L + R = 3L. So, the total number of games is 3L*(3L - 1)/2. But we need more information to find L.

The other piece of information is that the number of games won by left-handed players was 40% more than the number of games won by right-handed players. Hmm, okay. So if W_L is the number of games won by lefties and W_R by righties, then W_L = W_R + 0.4*W_R = 1.4*W_R.

But we also know that the total number of games is W_L + W_R = total games, which is 3L*(3L - 1)/2. So substituting W_L = 1.4*W_R into this equation gives 1.4*W_R + W_R = 2.4*W_R = total games. Therefore, W_R = (total games)/2.4 and W_L = 1.4*(total games)/2.4.

But how does this help us find L? We need to model the games between lefties and righties and how they contribute to W_L and W_R.

Let's think about the structure of the tournament. There are L left-handed players and R = 2L right-handed players. Each lefty plays against each righty and each lefty plays against other lefties. Similarly, each righty plays against each lefty and each righty plays against other righties.

So, total games can be broken down into three categories:

1. Games between left-handed players: L*(L - 1)/2
2. Games between right-handed players: R*(R - 1)/2 = 2L*(2L - 1)/2
3. Games between left-handed and right-handed players: L*R = L*2L = 2L²

In these games, the wins are distributed between lefties and righties. Let's denote:

- Let W_LL be the number of games lefties won against other lefties. Since these are games among lefties, all wins go to lefties. So W_LL = L*(L - 1)/2.

- Let W_RR be the number of games righties won against other righties. Similarly, W_RR = 2L*(2L - 1)/2.

- Let W_LR be the number of games lefties won against righties, and W_RL the number of games righties won against lefties. Since each game between a lefty and a righty results in a win for either lefty or righty, W_LR + W_RL = 2L².

Now, total wins by lefties, W_L = W_LL + W_LR.

Total wins by righties, W_R = W_RR + W_RL.

Given that W_L = 1.4*W_R, so:

W_LL + W_LR = 1.4*(W_RR + W_RL)

But we know that W_LR + W_RL = 2L², so W_RL = 2L² - W_LR.

Substituting into the equation:

W_LL + W_LR = 1.4*(W_RR + 2L² - W_LR)

Let's plug in W_LL and W_RR:

Lefties' wins from left vs left: L*(L - 1)/2

Righties' wins from right vs right: 2L*(2L - 1)/2 = L*(2L - 1)

So:

L*(L - 1)/2 + W_LR = 1.4*(L*(2L - 1) + 2L² - W_LR)

Let me simplify the right-hand side:

First, compute L*(2L - 1) + 2L² - W_LR = 2L² - L + 2L² - W_LR = 4L² - L - W_LR

Then multiply by 1.4:

1.4*(4L² - L - W_LR) = 5.6L² - 1.4L - 1.4W_LR

So the equation becomes:

(L*(L - 1)/2) + W_LR = 5.6L² - 1.4L - 1.4W_LR

Let's move all terms to the left side:

L*(L - 1)/2 + W_LR - 5.6L² + 1.4L + 1.4W_LR = 0

Combine like terms:

First, the L² terms: (1/2)L² - 5.6L² = (0.5 - 5.6)L² = -5.1L²

Then the L terms: -L + 1.4L = 0.4L

Then W_LR terms: W_LR + 1.4W_LR = 2.4W_LR

So:

-5.1L² + 0.4L + 2.4W_LR = 0

Hmm, but we still have W_LR in there. How can we relate W_LR? Let's think.

W_LR is the number of games lefties won against righties. Since each game is between a lefty and a righty, the total games are 2L², so W_LR can range from 0 to 2L². But we need another equation or a way to express W_LR in terms of L.

Wait, perhaps we can model the expected number of wins. If all lefties were equally skilled, the number of games they win against righties would be proportional to their numbers. But since there's no information about the skill levels, maybe we need to assume that the matches between lefties and righties result in a certain ratio of wins. But the problem doesn't specify that, so maybe we need a different approach.

Alternatively, maybe the total wins can be expressed in terms of L. Let's recall that total wins by lefties is W_L = W_LL + W_LR, and total wins by righties is W_R = W_RR + W_RL. Also, W_L = 1.4*W_R.

But we can write W_L + W_R = total games = 3L*(3L - 1)/2. So:

1.4*W_R + W_R = 2.4*W_R = 3L*(3L - 1)/2

Thus, W_R = [3L*(3L - 1)/2] / 2.4 = [3L*(3L - 1)/2] * (5/12) = [15L*(3L - 1)] / 24 = [5L*(3L - 1)] / 8

Similarly, W_L = 1.4*W_R = [7L*(3L - 1)] / 8

But also, W_L = W_LL + W_LR = L*(L - 1)/2 + W_LR

So:

L*(L - 1)/2 + W_LR = 7L*(3L - 1)/8

Multiply both sides by 8 to eliminate denominators:

4L*(L - 1) + 8W_LR = 7L*(3L - 1)

Simplify:

4L² - 4L + 8W_LR = 21L² - 7L

Bring all terms to left:

4L² -4L +8W_LR -21L² +7L =0

Combine like terms:

(4L² -21L²) + (-4L +7L) +8W_LR =0

-17L² + 3L +8W_LR=0

So:

8W_LR =17L² -3L

Thus:

W_LR = (17L² -3L)/8

But W_LR is the number of games lefties won against righties. Since each game between lefties and righties is a win for either lefty or righty, the total number of such games is 2L². Therefore:

W_LR + W_RL =2L²

But W_RL =2L² - W_LR

So, substituting W_LR from above:

W_RL=2L² - (17L² -3L)/8 = (16L² -17L² +3L)/8 = (-L² +3L)/8

But W_RL must be non-negative, as you can't have negative wins. Therefore:

(-L² +3L)/8 ≥0

Multiply both sides by 8 (positive, so inequality remains):

-L² +3L ≥0

Multiply both sides by -1 (inequality reverses):

L² -3L ≤0

Factor:

L(L -3) ≤0

Since L is a positive integer (number of players), the inequality holds when 0 ≤ L ≤3. But L must be at least 1. So possible L values are 1,2,3.

But let's check if these values satisfy the earlier equation.

Case 1: L=1

Then R=2*1=2, total players=3.

Total games=3*(3-1)/2=3.

Total W_R= [5*1*(3*1 -1)]/8=5*1*2/8=10/8=1.25. But W_R must be integer since it's the number of games. 1.25 is not integer. So invalid.

Case 2: L=2

Total players=6.

Total games=6*5/2=15.

W_R= [5*2*(3*2 -1)]/8=5*2*5/8=50/8=6.25. Not integer. Invalid.

Case 3: L=3

Total players=9.

Total games=9*8/2=36.

W_R= [5*3*(3*3 -1)]/8=5*3*8/8=15. So W_R=15, which is integer. Then W_L=1.4*15=21.

Check W_LR:

W_LR=(17L² -3L)/8=(17*9 -9)/8=(153 -9)/8=144/8=18.

Then W_RL=2L² - W_LR=2*9 -18=18-18=0. So righties won 0 games against lefties? But total games between lefties and righties is 2*3*3=18. If lefties won all 18 games, then righties have 0 wins against lefties, which is possible. Let's check total wins:

Lefties: W_LL + W_LR=3*2/2 +18=3 +18=21. Righties: W_RR + W_RL=3*2*(3*2 -1)/2 +0= (6*5)/2=15. So 21=1.4*15=21. Correct.

So L=3 is a valid solution. Let's check if there are higher L values. Wait, the inequality L(L -3) ≤0 gave L=1,2,3. So L=3 is the maximum. So L=3 is the only possible solution.

Therefore, total number of players is 3L=9, so total number of games is 9*8/2=36.

Wait, but the problem says "the total number of games played". So the answer is 36. But let me verify again.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let's see. If L=3, R=6, total players=9. Games between lefties: 3C2=3. All lefties' wins. Games between righties:6C2=15. Righties' wins. Games between lefties and righties:3*6=18. Lefties won all 18 games. So total lefties' wins=3+18=21. Righties' wins=15. 21 is indeed 40% more than 15 (15*1.4=21). So that checks out. Therefore, total games=36.

Therefore, the answer is 36.

**Final Answer**
The total number of games played is \boxed{36}.
Therefore, the total number of games played is $\boxed{36}$.
