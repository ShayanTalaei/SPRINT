Okay, so I need to find the acute angle between two lines with slopes 2 and 1/3. Hmm, let me recall how to do this. I think there's a formula involving the difference of the slopes. Let me try to remember. I believe the tangent of the angle between two lines is equal to the absolute value of (m2 - m1) divided by (1 + m1*m2). Is that right? Wait, let me check. If two lines have slopes m1 and m2, then the angle theta between them satisfies tan(theta) = |(m2 - m1)/(1 + m1*m2)|. Yeah, that sounds familiar. So if I plug in the slopes 2 and 1/3, I can compute tan(theta) and then take the arctangent to find the angle. Since the problem asks for the acute angle, I should make sure that the angle is less than 90 degrees. Let me confirm that. The formula gives the smallest angle between the two lines, so it should already be acute. Okay, so let's proceed step by step.

First, assign m1 = 2 and m2 = 1/3. Then, compute the difference in slopes: m2 - m1 = 1/3 - 2. Let me calculate that. 1/3 minus 2 is the same as 1/3 - 6/3 = -5/3. Taking the absolute value, that becomes 5/3. Then, compute the denominator: 1 + m1*m2 = 1 + (2)*(1/3) = 1 + 2/3 = 5/3. So, tan(theta) = |(m2 - m1)/(1 + m1*m2)| = |(-5/3)/(5/3)| = | -1 | = 1. Therefore, tan(theta) = 1. To find theta, take the arctangent of 1. Arctangent of 1 is 45 degrees. Since 45 degrees is acute, that's the answer. Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me verify this with another method to be sure.

Alternatively, I can compute the angles each line makes with the x-axis and then find the difference. For the first line with slope 2, the angle alpha satisfies tan(alpha) = 2. So alpha = arctan(2). Similarly, for the second line with slope 1/3, the angle beta satisfies tan(beta) = 1/3, so beta = arctan(1/3). Then, the angle between them is |alpha - beta|. Let's compute that. First, find arctan(2) and arctan(1/3). Arctan(2) is approximately 63.4349 degrees, and arctan(1/3) is approximately 18.4349 degrees. Subtracting them gives 63.4349 - 18.4349 = 45 degrees. So that confirms the previous result. Therefore, the acute angle is indeed 45 degrees. 

Wait, just to make sure there's no mistake in the calculations. Let's recompute tan(theta). The formula is tan(theta) = |(m2 - m1)/(1 + m1*m2)|. Plugging in m1 = 2 and m2 = 1/3: numerator is 1/3 - 2 = -5/3, absolute value is 5/3. Denominator is 1 + (2)(1/3) = 1 + 2/3 = 5/3. So 5/3 divided by 5/3 is 1. Arctangent of 1 is 45 degrees. Yep, that's correct. 

Another way to think about this is that if two lines are perpendicular, their slopes multiply to -1. Here, 2 * 1/3 = 2/3, which is not -1, so they aren't perpendicular. But the angle between them is 45 degrees, which is acute. Since the formula gives the absolute value, it takes care of the acute angle regardless of the order of the slopes. So, even if we switch m1 and m2, the result would be the same. Let me check that. If we take m1 = 1/3 and m2 = 2, then numerator is 2 - 1/3 = 5/3, absolute value is 5/3. Denominator is 1 + (1/3)(2) = 1 + 2/3 = 5/3. So tan(theta) is still 1, leading to 45 degrees. Perfect. So the order of the slopes doesn't matter here. 

Is there any other way this could go wrong? Let's see. Suppose someone miscalculates the difference in slopes. For example, if they do m1 - m2 instead of m2 - m1, but since we take absolute value, it won't matter. Similarly, if they miscalculate the denominator, but 1 + m1*m2 is straightforward. 2*1/3 is 2/3, plus 1 is 5/3. So that's correct. 

Alternatively, if someone confuses the formula with the tangent of the sum of angles instead of the difference. But no, the formula is for the tangent of the angle between them, which is the absolute difference of their individual angles with the x-axis. So, since tan(theta) = |(m2 - m1)/(1 + m1*m2)|, it's correct. 

Therefore, after multiple checks, the answer seems to be 45 degrees. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning. The calculations are straightforward and cross-verified using two different methods: directly using the formula and computing individual angles. Both methods lead to the same conclusion. Therefore, I can be confident that the acute angle between the two lines is 45 degrees.
Therefore, the degree measure of the acute angle formed by lines with slopes $2$ and $\frac{1}{3}$ is $\boxed{45^\circ}$.
