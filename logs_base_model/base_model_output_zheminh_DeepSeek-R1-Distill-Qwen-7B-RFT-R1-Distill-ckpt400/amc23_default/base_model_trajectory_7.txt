Okay, so I need to find the maximum value of the imaginary part of a complex number z that satisfies |1 + z + z²| = 4. Then express that maximum imaginary part as sqrt(m)/n where m and n are coprime, and find m + n. Hmm, let's start by recalling some complex number properties and see how to approach this.

First, complex numbers can be represented in the form z = x + yi, where x and y are real numbers. The modulus |1 + z + z²| equals 4. So, maybe I should express 1 + z + z² in terms of x and y and then compute its modulus squared, set it equal to 16 (since |w| = 4 implies |w|² = 16), and then find the maximum y.

Let me write that out. Let z = x + yi. Then:

1 + z + z² = 1 + (x + yi) + (x + yi)².

First, compute z²:

z² = (x + yi)² = x² - y² + 2xyi.

So, adding up all terms:

1 + z + z² = 1 + x + yi + x² - y² + 2xyi.

Combine like terms:

Real parts: 1 + x + x² - y².

Imaginary parts: y + 2xy.

So, 1 + z + z² = (1 + x + x² - y²) + (y + 2xy)i.

The modulus squared is then:

[1 + x + x² - y²]^2 + [y + 2xy]^2 = 16.

So, the equation we need to satisfy is:

(1 + x + x² - y²)^2 + (y + 2xy)^2 = 16.

Our goal is to maximize y, the imaginary part of z. So, we need to find the maximum value of y such that the above equation holds for some real x.

This seems like a constrained optimization problem. Maybe we can use calculus here. Let me consider y as a function to maximize with the constraint given by the equation above.

Alternatively, perhaps we can parameterize z on the complex plane and use some geometric interpretations. But since the equation is quadratic in z, maybe algebraic methods would be better.

Alternatively, maybe using polar coordinates. Let me try that. Let z = r e^{iθ}, where r is the modulus of z and θ is the argument. Then, z² = r² e^{i2θ}. Then, 1 + z + z² can be written as 1 + r e^{iθ} + r² e^{i2θ}. The modulus of this sum is 4.

But this might complicate things because exponents with angles can be tricky. Let's see. The modulus squared would be [1 + r cosθ + r² cos2θ]^2 + [r sinθ + r² sin2θ]^2 = 16.

Hmm, that's still complicated. Maybe expand the squares and use trigonometric identities. Let me try that.

First, expand [1 + r cosθ + r² cos2θ]^2:

= 1 + 2r cosθ + 2r² cos2θ + r² cos²θ + 2r³ cosθ cos2θ + r^4 cos²2θ.

Similarly, [r sinθ + r² sin2θ]^2:

= r² sin²θ + 2r³ sinθ sin2θ + r^4 sin²2θ.

Adding them together:

1 + 2r cosθ + 2r² cos2θ + r² cos²θ + 2r³ cosθ cos2θ + r^4 cos²2θ + r² sin²θ + 2r³ sinθ sin2θ + r^4 sin²2θ = 16.

Combine terms:

1 + 2r cosθ + 2r² (cos2θ + (cos²θ + sin²θ)) + r^4 (cos²2θ + sin²2θ) + 2r³ (cosθ cos2θ + sinθ sin2θ) = 16.

Note that cos²θ + sin²θ = 1, and cos²2θ + sin²2θ = 1. Also, cosθ cos2θ + sinθ sin2θ = cos(2θ - θ) = cosθ (using the cosine addition formula). Wait, actually:

cos(A - B) = cosA cosB + sinA sinB. So, cosθ cos2θ + sinθ sin2θ = cos(2θ - θ) = cosθ. Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

1 + 2r cosθ + 2r² (cos2θ + 1) + r^4 (1) + 2r³ cosθ = 16.

So, combining terms:

1 + 2r cosθ + 2r² (1 + cos2θ) + r^4 + 2r³ cosθ = 16.

We can use the identity 1 + cos2θ = 2cos²θ, so:

1 + 2r cosθ + 2r² * 2cos²θ + r^4 + 2r³ cosθ = 16.

Simplify:

1 + 2r cosθ + 4r² cos²θ + r^4 + 2r³ cosθ = 16.

Combine like terms:

1 + (2r + 2r³) cosθ + 4r² cos²θ + r^4 = 16.

Hmm, this still looks complicated. Maybe it's not the best approach. Let me consider going back to the original algebraic approach with x and y.

We had:

(1 + x + x² - y²)^2 + (y + 2xy)^2 = 16.

Let me denote A = 1 + x + x² - y² and B = y + 2xy.

So, A² + B² = 16.

We need to maximize y. Let's consider using calculus here. Let's treat this as a function of x and y, with the constraint A² + B² = 16. We can use Lagrange multipliers to maximize y subject to this constraint.

So, let me set up the Lagrangian. Let’s let f(x, y) = y, and the constraint g(x, y) = A² + B² - 16 = 0.

The Lagrangian is L = f(x, y) - λ g(x, y) = y - λ[(1 + x + x² - y²)^2 + (y + 2xy)^2 - 16].

Then, take partial derivatives with respect to x, y, and λ, and set them equal to zero.

Compute ∂L/∂x:

∂L/∂x = 0 - λ [2(1 + x + x² - y²)(1 + 2x) + 2(y + 2xy)(2y)] = 0.

Similarly, ∂L/∂y = 1 - λ [2(1 + x + x² - y²)(-2y) + 2(y + 2xy)(1 + 2x)] = 0.

And ∂L/∂λ = -( (1 + x + x² - y²)^2 + (y + 2xy)^2 - 16 ) = 0.

So, we have the system of equations:

1. λ [2(1 + x + x² - y²)(1 + 2x) + 2(y + 2xy)(2y)] = 0.

2. λ [2(1 + x + x² - y²)(-2y) + 2(y + 2xy)(1 + 2x)] = -1.

3. (1 + x + x² - y²)^2 + (y + 2xy)^2 = 16.

Since we are looking for a maximum y, and if the constraint is satisfied, λ cannot be zero (otherwise, equation 2 would imply 0 = -1, which is impossible). Therefore, the expressions inside the brackets in equations 1 and 2 must be zero.

So, from equation 1:

2(1 + x + x² - y²)(1 + 2x) + 2(y + 2xy)(2y) = 0.

Divide both sides by 2:

(1 + x + x² - y²)(1 + 2x) + (y + 2xy)(2y) = 0.

Similarly, equation 2:

2(1 + x + x² - y²)(-2y) + 2(y + 2xy)(1 + 2x) = -2.

Divide both sides by 2:

(1 + x + x² - y²)(-2y) + (y + 2xy)(1 + 2x) = -1.

So now we have two equations:

Equation 1:

(1 + x + x² - y²)(1 + 2x) + (y + 2xy)(2y) = 0.

Equation 2:

(1 + x + x² - y²)(-2y) + (y + 2xy)(1 + 2x) = -1.

Let’s denote C = 1 + x + x² - y² and D = y + 2xy. Then equations become:

1. C(1 + 2x) + D(2y) = 0.

2. C(-2y) + D(1 + 2x) = -1.

So, we can write this as a system:

C(1 + 2x) + 2y D = 0.

-2y C + D(1 + 2x) = -1.

This is a linear system in variables C and D. Let me write it in matrix form:

[ (1 + 2x)   2y     ] [C]   = [0]
[ -2y      (1 + 2x) ] [D]     [-1]

The determinant of the coefficient matrix is (1 + 2x)^2 - (2y)(-2y) = (1 + 2x)^2 + 4y².

Assuming the determinant is non-zero (which it is unless (1 + 2x)^2 + 4y² = 0, which can't happen since squares are non-negative and sum to zero only if both are zero. But (1 + 2x)^2 = 0 implies x = -1/2, and 4y² = 0 implies y = 0. Then 1 + 2*(-1/2) = 0, so determinant is zero in that case. So, except for that specific point, determinant is non-zero. So, the system has a unique solution given by Cramer's rule.

But since we have C and D in terms of x and y, and C and D are defined as:

C = 1 + x + x² - y²,

D = y + 2xy.

So, let's solve the system for C and D.

Multiply the first equation by (1 + 2x):

C(1 + 2x)^2 + 2y D(1 + 2x) = 0.

Multiply the second equation by 2y:

-4y² C + 2y D(1 + 2x) = -2y.

Subtract the two equations:

[ C(1 + 2x)^2 + 2y D(1 + 2x) ] - [ -4y² C + 2y D(1 + 2x) ] = 0 - (-2y)

Simplify:

C(1 + 2x)^2 + 4y² C = 2y.

Factor out C:

C[ (1 + 2x)^2 + 4y² ] = 2y.

But from equation 1, C(1 + 2x) + 2y D = 0. Let's express D from equation 1:

D = -C(1 + 2x)/(2y).

Substitute into the expression for D:

D = -C(1 + 2x)/(2y).

But D is also equal to y + 2xy. So,

y + 2xy = -C(1 + 2x)/(2y).

Multiply both sides by 2y:

2y² + 4xy² = -C(1 + 2x).

But from the previous result, C = 2y / [ (1 + 2x)^2 + 4y² ].

So,

2y² + 4xy² = - [2y / ( (1 + 2x)^2 + 4y² ) ] * (1 + 2x).

Multiply both sides by [ (1 + 2x)^2 + 4y² ]:

(2y² + 4xy²)( (1 + 2x)^2 + 4y² ) = -2y(1 + 2x).

Factor left side:

2y²(1 + 2x)( (1 + 2x)^2 + 4y² ) = -2y(1 + 2x).

Assuming 1 + 2x ≠ 0 (since if 1 + 2x = 0, x = -1/2, which we can check separately), we can divide both sides by 2y(1 + 2x):

y( (1 + 2x)^2 + 4y² ) = -1.

So,

y( (1 + 2x)^2 + 4y² ) = -1.

But we need to maximize y. Since we are maximizing y, and the left side is y times something squared, which is non-negative, so the left side is non-positive. But the right side is -1, so this implies that y is negative? Wait, but we want to maximize y, which would be positive. Hmm, this seems contradictory. Maybe there's a mistake here.

Wait, let me check the algebra again.

From the determinant approach, we had:

C[ (1 + 2x)^2 + 4y² ] = 2y.

But also, from equation 1:

C(1 + 2x) + 2y D = 0.

And D = y + 2xy.

So, substituting D into equation 1:

C(1 + 2x) + 2y(y + 2xy) = 0.

Which is:

C(1 + 2x) + 2y² + 4x y² = 0.

So,

C(1 + 2x) = -2y² - 4x y² = -2y²(1 + 2x).

Thus,

C = -2y²(1 + 2x)/(1 + 2x) = -2y².

But this is only if 1 + 2x ≠ 0. So, if 1 + 2x ≠ 0, then C = -2y².

But C is also equal to 1 + x + x² - y². So,

1 + x + x² - y² = -2y².

Simplify:

1 + x + x² = -y².

But the left side is a quadratic in x: x² + x + 1. The discriminant is 1 - 4 = -3, so it's always positive (since the coefficient of x² is positive). Therefore, x² + x + 1 is always positive. So, 1 + x + x² = -y² implies that the left side is positive and the right side is non-positive. The only way this can happen is if both sides are zero. But x² + x + 1 is never zero. Therefore, this is impossible. Contradiction.

Therefore, our assumption that 1 + 2x ≠ 0 must be wrong. Therefore, 1 + 2x = 0, which implies x = -1/2.

So, let's check the case when 1 + 2x = 0, i.e., x = -1/2.

Then, let's substitute x = -1/2 into the original equations.

First, x = -1/2.

Compute z = x + yi = -1/2 + yi.

Then, compute 1 + z + z²:

1 + (-1/2 + yi) + (-1/2 + yi)^2.

First, compute (-1/2 + yi)^2:

= (1/4 - y²) - yi.

So, 1 + (-1/2 + yi) + (1/4 - y² - yi) =

1 - 1/2 + 1/4 + yi - yi - y² =

(1 - 1/2 + 1/4) + (yi - yi) - y² =

(3/4) - y².

So, 1 + z + z² = (3/4 - y²) + 0i.

Therefore, modulus squared is (3/4 - y²)^2 = 16.

So,

(3/4 - y²)^2 = 16.

Take square roots:

3/4 - y² = ±4.

Case 1: 3/4 - y² = 4.

Then, -y² = 4 - 3/4 = 13/4.

So, y² = -13/4, which is impossible.

Case 2: 3/4 - y² = -4.

Then, -y² = -4 - 3/4 = -19/4.

So, y² = 19/4.

Therefore, y = ±√(19)/2.

But since we are looking for the maximum value of the imaginary part, which is y, the maximum is √19 / 2.

Wait, but the problem states that the maximum imaginary part is of the form sqrt(m)/n where m and n are coprime. So, sqrt(19)/2 is already in the form, with m=19 and n=2, which are coprime. So, m + n = 21.

But hold on, is this correct? Because we assumed that 1 + 2x = 0, but does this give the maximum y?

Wait, but in this case, when x = -1/2, we found that y can be ±√19 / 2. But does this correspond to a maximum? Let me verify.

Alternatively, maybe there is a higher y when 1 + 2x ≠ 0. But earlier, when we tried solving with 1 + 2x ≠ 0, we arrived at a contradiction. So, perhaps the only solutions occur when x = -1/2, leading to y = ±√19 / 2. Therefore, the maximum imaginary part is √19 / 2, so m + n = 19 + 2 = 21.

But let me check this again. Because when we set up the system with Lagrange multipliers, we ended up with a contradiction unless 1 + 2x = 0. Therefore, the only critical points are when x = -1/2, leading to y = ±√19 / 2. Hence, those are the only possible extrema. Therefore, the maximum imaginary part is √19 / 2, so m + n = 21.

But let me verify this by plugging back into the original equation.

Compute |1 + z + z²| when z = -1/2 + (√19 / 2)i.

Compute 1 + z + z²:

As before, we already computed that 1 + z + z² = 3/4 - y², which with y² = 19/4 is 3/4 - 19/4 = (-16)/4 = -4. So, the modulus is | -4 | = 4, which matches the condition. Therefore, this is a valid solution.

But wait, if z is -1/2 + (√19 / 2)i, then the imaginary part is √19 / 2, which is approximately 2.179. Is there a way to have a larger imaginary part?

Alternatively, maybe there's another method to solve this problem.

Another approach could be to parameterize z in terms of its modulus and argument. Let z = r e^{iθ}. Then, 1 + z + z² = 1 + r e^{iθ} + r² e^{i2θ}. The modulus squared is |1 + r e^{iθ} + r² e^{i2θ}|² = 16.

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe use substitution.

Let’s consider the equation 1 + z + z² = w, where |w| = 4. Then, z² + z + 1 = w. So, z² + z + (1 - w) = 0. The discriminant of this quadratic equation is 1 - 4(1 - w) = 4w - 3. Therefore, z = [-1 ± sqrt(4w - 3)] / 2.

But z is a complex number, so sqrt(4w - 3) must be a complex number as well. The discriminant 4w - 3 must be a complex number. The square root of a complex number can be expressed in terms of its real and imaginary parts.

But this might not be helpful. Alternatively, perhaps consider that |z² + z + 1| = 4. Let’s denote u = z + 1/2. Then, z = u - 1/2. Substitute into the equation:

| (u - 1/2)^2 + (u - 1/2) + 1 | = 4.

Compute:

(u - 1/2)^2 = u² - u + 1/4.

Then, adding (u - 1/2):

u² - u + 1/4 + u - 1/2 + 1 = u² + (1/4 - 1/2 + 1) = u² + (3/4).

So, |u² + 3/4| = 4.

Therefore, |u² + 3/4| = 4.

So, u² + 3/4 is a complex number whose modulus is 4. Let’s write u² = v. Then, |v + 3/4| = 4. The set of points v in the complex plane such that |v + 3/4| = 4 is a circle centered at (-3/4, 0) with radius 4. So, v must lie on this circle. Then, u² = v, which means u is a square root of v. Therefore, u = sqrt(v), which has two possible values for each v (except when v is zero). Therefore, the maximum imaginary part of z is related to the maximum imaginary part of u - 1/2, where u² is on the circle |v + 3/4| = 4.

But this seems a bit abstract. Let me think.

Alternatively, since |u² + 3/4| = 4, then u² = 4 e^{iφ} - 3/4, where φ is a real number. Then, u = sqrt(4 e^{iφ} - 3/4). But sqrt of a complex number is multi-valued, so we can take the principal value.

But this might not be helpful. Alternatively, consider writing u² = a + bi, then |u² + 3/4| = sqrt( (a + 3/4)^2 + b^2 ) = 4. So,

(a + 3/4)^2 + b^2 = 16.

But u² = a + bi, which implies that u = sqrt(a + bi). Let's write u = c + di. Then, u² = (c² - d²) + 2cdi = a + bi. Therefore, c² - d² = a, and 2cd = b. So,

(a + 3/4)^2 + b^2 = 16.

But from u² = a + bi, we have c² - d² = a and 2cd = b. So, substituting a = c² - d² and b = 2cd into the above equation:

(c² - d² + 3/4)^2 + (2cd)^2 = 16.

Expand:

(c² - d² + 3/4)^2 + 4c²d² = 16.

Let me expand the first term:

= [ (c² - d²)^2 + (3/4)(c² - d²) + (3/4)^2 ] + 4c²d²

= (c^4 - 2c²d² + d^4) + (3/4)(c² - d²) + 9/16 + 4c²d²

Combine like terms:

c^4 - 2c²d² + d^4 + 4c²d² + (3/4)(c² - d²) + 9/16

= c^4 + 2c²d² + d^4 + (3/4)(c² - d²) + 9/16

Note that c^4 + 2c²d² + d^4 = (c² + d²)^2.

So,

(c² + d²)^2 + (3/4)(c² - d²) + 9/16 = 16.

But c² + d² = |u|², which is |z + 1/2|². Let me denote |u|² = t. Then,

t² + (3/4)(c² - d²) + 9/16 = 16.

But c² - d² = a = Re(u²) = Re(z + 1/2)^2. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, since u = c + di, then c² - d² = a and 2cd = b. So, c² + d² = sqrt(a² + b²) = |u|. But we already have |u² + 3/4| = 4, which is |v + 3/4| = 4 where v = u². So, perhaps this substitution isn't helpful.

Alternatively, since we need to find the maximum imaginary part of z, which is Im(z) = Im(u - 1/2) = Im(u) - 1/2. So, to maximize Im(z), we need to maximize Im(u) - 1/2, which is equivalent to maximizing Im(u). So, the problem reduces to finding the maximum Im(u) such that u² lies on the circle |u² + 3/4| = 4.

So, let’s set v = u². Then, |v + 3/4| = 4. So, v lies on a circle centered at (-3/4, 0) with radius 4. The maximum imaginary part of u is half the maximum imaginary part of v, since v = u². Wait, no. Wait, if u = c + di, then v = u² = (c² - d²) + 2cdi. So, Im(v) = 2cd. Therefore, Im(u) = d. So, Im(v) = 2c d. But since Im(u) = d, we can write Im(v) = 2c Im(u). Therefore, the maximum Im(u) is related to the maximum d such that v = (c² - d²) + 2cdi lies on |v + 3/4| = 4.

So, to maximize d, we need to find the maximum d such that there exists c with (c² - d² + 3/4)^2 + (2c d)^2 = 16.

Let’s write this equation:

(c² - d² + 3/4)^2 + (2c d)^2 = 16.

Let’s expand this:

(c² - d² + 3/4)^2 + 4c² d² = 16.

Which is similar to the previous equation.

Let me denote s = c², t = d². Then, the equation becomes:

(s - t + 3/4)^2 + 4s t = 16.

But s and t are non-negative real numbers.

Our goal is to maximize d, which is sqrt(t). So, we need to maximize t subject to the above equation.

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps use calculus. Let’s consider the equation:

(c² - d² + 3/4)^2 + 4c² d² = 16.

We can treat this as a function of c and d, and try to maximize d. Let’s take partial derivatives with respect to c and set to zero.

But this might get messy. Alternatively, maybe use substitution.

Let’s set u = c² - d². Then, the equation becomes:

(u + 3/4)^2 + 4c² d² = 16.

But c² d² = (s)(t) = s t. Wait, but u = c² - d², and we have s = c², t = d². So, u = s - t. Then, the equation is:

(u + 3/4)^2 + 4(s)(t) = 16.

But s and t are related by u = s - t. So, t = s - u.

But this might not help. Alternatively, maybe use Lagrange multipliers again here.

Wait, but perhaps instead of going back to the original problem, let's recall that in the previous approach, we found that the maximum imaginary part is sqrt(19)/2, which is approximately 2.179. But is there a way to verify this?

Wait, in the initial approach with Lagrange multipliers, we arrived at x = -1/2, leading to y = sqrt(19)/2. Since that approach seems to give a consistent solution, and substituting back into the original equation works, then that might indeed be the maximum. Therefore, the answer is sqrt(19)/2, so m + n = 19 + 2 = 21.

But let me check if there is a higher possible y. For example, suppose z is purely imaginary. Let’s suppose z = ki, where k is real. Then, compute |1 + z + z²|:

1 + ki + (ki)^2 = 1 + ki - k².

The modulus squared is (1 - k²)^2 + k². Set equal to 16:

(1 - k²)^2 + k² = 16.

Expand:

1 - 2k² + k^4 + k² = 1 - k² + k^4 = 16.

So,

k^4 - k² - 15 = 0.

Let’s let m = k², so equation becomes:

m² - m - 15 = 0.

Solutions:

m = [1 ± sqrt(1 + 60)] / 2 = [1 ± sqrt(61)] / 2.

Since m must be non-negative, m = [1 + sqrt(61)] / 2 ≈ (1 + 7.81)/2 ≈ 4.405.

Thus, k² ≈ 4.405, so k ≈ ±2.099. Therefore, when z is purely imaginary, the maximum imaginary part is approximately 2.099, which is less than sqrt(19)/2 ≈ 2.179. Therefore, the previous solution with z = -1/2 + sqrt(19)/2 i, which has a larger imaginary part, is indeed larger.

Therefore, the maximum imaginary part of z is sqrt(19)/2, so m + n = 19 + 2 = 21.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{21}
Therefore, the maximum value of the imaginary part of $z$ is $\boxed{\frac{\sqrt{19}}{2}}$, and $m+n = 19 + 2 = \boxed{21}$.
