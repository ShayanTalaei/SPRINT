Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the question is: When n standard six-sided dice are rolled, the product of the numbers rolled can be any of 936 possible values. What is n?

Hmm, first, I need to understand what the problem is asking. We roll n dice, each die can show a number from 1 to 6. The product of all these numbers can take 936 different values. We need to find n.

Alright, let's start by recalling that each die has possible outcomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. When we roll multiple dice, the product is the multiplication of each die's outcome. The number of distinct products we can get depends on the combinations of these numbers.

The key here is that the product can be any of 936 possible values. So, we need to find n such that the number of distinct products when rolling n dice is 936.

First, maybe I should figure out the number of distinct products for smaller n and see if there's a pattern or a way to compute it. But n could be up to a certain number, and 936 is a large number, so n is probably not too big, but I need to check.

Wait, let's think about the possible products. Each die contributes a factor of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. The product will be a number that can be factored into primes. Since 6 is 2*3, the possible primes involved are 2, 3, and 5. The numbers 1 is 1, 4 is 2Â², 5 is 5, and 6 is 2*3.

So, when multiplied together, the product's prime factors will be combinations of 2, 3, and 5. The exponents for each prime will depend on the number of times each die's factors contribute.

For example, each die can contribute:

- 1: no primes
- 2: 2^1
- 3: 3^1
- 4: 2^2
- 5: 5^1
- 6: 2^1 * 3^1

Therefore, the product will be of the form 2^a * 3^b * 5^c, where a, b, c are non-negative integers.

Now, the number of distinct products is equal to the number of distinct triples (a, b, c) that can be formed by multiplying the contributions from each die.

Each die can contribute to a, b, c in different ways. Let's model this.

Each die can be represented by a vector (x, y, z), where x is the exponent of 2 contributed by that die, y is the exponent of 3, and z is the exponent of 5.

Let's list the possible (x, y, z) for each die face:

- 1: (0, 0, 0)
- 2: (1, 0, 0)
- 3: (0, 1, 0)
- 4: (2, 0, 0)
- 5: (0, 0, 1)
- 6: (1, 1, 0)

So, each die contributes one of these vectors. When we roll n dice, the total exponents (a, b, c) will be the sum of the exponents from each die. The number of distinct (a, b, c) triples is the number of distinct products.

Therefore, the problem reduces to finding n such that the number of distinct (a, b, c) triples, where each component is the sum of contributions from n dice, is 936.

So, we need to compute the number of distinct triples (a, b, c) given n dice, each contributing (x_i, y_i, z_i) as above, and sum them up. The total number of such triples is 936.

Hmm, this seems a bit abstract. Maybe we can model this as a problem of counting the number of possible exponents for each prime.

Alternatively, since each die's contribution is independent, maybe we can model the possible exponents for 2, 3, and 5 separately, considering the contributions from each die.

Wait, but the exponents are not independent because different dice contribute to different primes. However, the contributions are additive. So, maybe the total exponents a, b, c are sums of the contributions from each die.

But each die's contribution affects a, b, c. For example, a die showing 6 contributes 1 to a and 1 to b, but 0 to c. So, the exponents a, b, c are dependent on the same die.

Therefore, the problem is a bit more complex than just multiplying the number of possibilities for each prime.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to model the problem as the number of distinct products, which is equivalent to the number of distinct tuples (a, b, c) where each die contributes some (x, y, z) as above, and the sum is (a, b, c).

So, the problem is similar to counting the number of distinct sums in a set of vectors. This is a classic problem in additive combinatorics.

But I'm not sure about the exact formula here. Maybe we can find the number of possible exponents for each prime and then multiply them if they are independent, but they are not.

Wait, but let's think step by step. Let's first consider the exponents for each prime separately. For example, the exponent a is the sum of contributions from each die to 2. Each die can contribute 0, 1, or 2 to a (from faces 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, respectively: 1 contributes 0, 2 contributes 1, 3 contributes 0, 4 contributes 2, 5 contributes 0, 6 contributes 1). Similarly, the exponent b is contributed by faces 2, 3, 6 (2 contributes 0, 3 contributes 1, 6 contributes 1). The exponent c is contributed only by faces 5 (5 contributes 1, others contribute 0).

Therefore, the exponents a, b, c can be treated as independent variables, but with dependencies because each die contributes to a, b, c in a specific way. However, a die cannot contribute to a and b unless it's a 6, which contributes 1 to both. So, the exponents a and b are not independent because they share contributions from 6.

Therefore, the total exponents a, b, c are dependent variables. Hence, the number of distinct triples (a, b, c) is not simply the product of the number of possible a's, b's, and c's.

This complicates things. So, maybe we need a different approach.

Alternatively, since the product can be represented as 2^a * 3^b * 5^c, where a, b, c are non-negative integers, and each die contributes to these exponents as per the table above. The total exponents are sums of individual contributions.

Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the number of distinct triples (a, b, c) that can be formed by adding up the contributions from n dice, each of which can contribute to (a, b, c) as per the table.

This seems similar to a problem of counting the number of distinct sums in a multi-dimensional space. However, exact computation might be difficult.

Alternatively, maybe we can model the number of distinct exponents for each prime and then multiply them, but we have to consider overlaps.

Wait, but since each die can contribute to multiple primes, the exponents are not independent. For example, a die showing 6 contributes to both a and b. Therefore, the exponents a and b are not independent. So, the total number of distinct (a, b, c) is not the product of the number of possible a's, b's, and c's.

Therefore, this approach might not work.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model each die as contributing a vector in a 3-dimensional space, where each coordinate corresponds to the exponent of a prime. Then, the problem becomes the number of distinct points reachable by summing n such vectors, each chosen from a fixed set.

This is similar to counting the number of distinct sums in a set of vectors. The exact count is non-trivial, but perhaps for small n, we can compute it.

Given that 936 is the number of distinct products, which is the number of distinct triples (a, b, c). Therefore, our target is to find n such that the number of distinct (a, b, c) is 936.

Since 936 is a large number, we can estimate the value of n.

First, let's note that the number of distinct products increases with n. Therefore, we can try to compute the number of distinct products for n=1,2,3,... until we reach 936.

But doing this manually for each n would be time-consuming. Maybe we can find a pattern or formula.

Alternatively, let's think about how the number of distinct products grows with n.

For n=1: The possible products are 1,2,3,4,5,6. So, 6 distinct products.

For n=2: The products are the product of two dice. Let's compute them. The possible products are from 1*1=1 up to 6*6=36. However, not all numbers between 1 and 36 are possible. For example, 7 can be achieved as 1*7, but since the maximum on a die is 6, 7 can't be achieved. Wait, actually, the maximum product is 6*6=36. But the possible products would be numbers that can be expressed as the product of two numbers from 1 to 6.

Let me list them:

1: 1*1

2: 1*2, 2*1

3: 1*3, 3*1

4: 1*4, 2*2, 4*1

5: 1*5, 5*1

6: 1*6, 2*3, 3*2, 6*1

8: 2*4, 4*2

9: 3*3

10: 2*5, 5*2

12: 2*6, 3*4, 4*3, 6*2

15: 3*5, 5*3

16: 4*4

18: 3*6, 6*3

20: 4*5, 5*4

24: 4*6, 6*4

25: 5*5

30: 5*6, 6*5

36: 6*6

So, the distinct products for n=2 are:

1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,12,15,16,18,20,24,25,30,36.

Counting them: Let's list them:

1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,12,15,16,18,20,24,25,30,36. That's 17 distinct products.

So, n=2 gives 17 distinct products.

For n=3: Now, the products are the product of three dice. The minimum product is 1, maximum is 6^3=216. However, not all numbers between 1 and 216 are possible. The number of distinct products would be significantly larger than n=2.

But 936 is the target, which is much larger than 17, so n=3 might still be too small. Let's check.

Wait, but even n=3: The number of distinct products is going to be more than 17^3? No, not exactly. Because the products are multiplicative, but each die is independent. However, the number of distinct products grows multiplicatively, but not exponentially because of overlapping products.

Wait, perhaps the number of distinct products for n dice is equal to the number of distinct products of numbers from 1 to 6, taken n times. This is a multiplicative partition problem, but with constraints.

Alternatively, maybe we can model the number of possible exponents for each prime and multiply them, but considering overlaps.

Wait, earlier, we saw that each die contributes to a, b, c. The exponents a, b, c are the sum of contributions from each die. The contributions for a are 0,1, or 2 (from faces 1,2,3,4,5,6 respectively). Similarly, contributions for b are 0 or 1 (from faces 1,3,5,6). Contributions for c are 0 or 1 (from face 5).

Therefore, the exponents a, b, c are sums of contributions from n dice. Let's model each exponent as a random variable.

The exponent a is the sum of contributions from each die to a. Each die can contribute 0,1, or 2 to a, with probabilities depending on the die face. Similarly for b and c.

But since the contributions are dependent (since 6 contributes to both a and b), the exponents a and b are not independent.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the number of possible exponents for a, b, c, considering the dependencies.

Wait, maybe we can model the possible exponents a, b, c as combinations of the die contributions.

Each die can contribute (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (2,0,0), (0,0,1), or (1,1,0). So, each die adds one of these vectors.

Therefore, after n dice, the total exponent vector is the sum of n such vectors. The number of distinct exponent vectors is the number of distinct sums.

This is similar to a problem in additive combinatorics. The exact count is difficult, but perhaps for small n, we can compute it.

Alternatively, we can use generating functions to model the number of distinct products.

Let me try that approach.

The generating function for the exponents of a single die is:

For exponent a (contributions from 2):

Each die can contribute 0,1, or 2. The generating function for a single die's contribution to a is:

G_a(x) = x^0 + x^1 + x^0 + x^2 + x^0 + x^1 = 1 + 2x + x^2

Wait, no. Wait, each face contributes a certain exponent. For example, face 1 contributes 0, face 2 contributes 1, face 3 contributes 0, face 4 contributes 2, face 5 contributes 0, face 6 contributes 1.

So, the generating function for a single die's contribution to a is:

G_a(x) = (number of ways to contribute 0) * x^0 + (number of ways to contribute 1) * x^1 + (number of ways to contribute 2) * x^2

Similarly, for b:

Face 1: 0

Face 2: 0

Face 3: 1

Face 4: 0

Face 5: 0

Face 6: 1

So, the generating function for b is:

G_b(x) = (number of ways to contribute 0) * x^0 + (number of ways to contribute 1) * x^1 = (4 ways for 0) * x^0 + (2 ways for 1) * x^1 = 4 + 2x

For c:

Face 1: 0

Face 2: 0

Face 3: 0

Face 4: 0

Face 5: 1

Face 6: 0

So, G_c(x) = 5x^0 + 1x^1 = 5 + x

Therefore, the generating function for a single die is:

G(x, y, z) = G_a(x) * G_b(y) * G_c(z) = (1 + 2x + x^2) * (4 + 2y) * (5 + z)

But since the contributions to a, b, c are not independent (due to the 6 die face contributing to both a and b), this might not be the correct approach.

Wait, actually, the generating function should account for the fact that each die contributes a vector (a_i, b_i, c_i). Therefore, the generating function for the sum of n dice would be the product of the individual generating functions.

Each die's generating function is:

G(x, y, z) = x^{a_1} y^{b_1} z^{c_1} + x^{a_2} y^{b_2} z^{c_2} + ... + x^{a_6} y^{b_6} z^{c_6}

Where (a_i, b_i, c_i) are the contributions from each face.

So, for face 1: (0,0,0)

face 2: (1,0,0)

face 3: (0,1,0)

face 4: (2,0,0)

face 5: (0,0,1)

face 6: (1,1,0)

Therefore, G(x, y, z) = 1 + x + y + x^2 + z + x y

So, G(x, y, z) = x^2 + x y + x + y + z + 1

Wait, let's confirm:

Face 1: 1 (x^0 y^0 z^0)

Face 2: x^1 y^0 z^0

Face 3: x^0 y^1 z^0

Face 4: x^2 y^0 z^0

Face 5: x^0 y^0 z^1

Face 6: x^1 y^1 z^0

Therefore, G(x, y, z) = 1 + x + y + x^2 + z + x y

Yes, that's correct.

Therefore, the generating function for the product of n dice is [G(x, y, z)]^n.

The coefficient of x^a y^b z^c in [G(x, y, z)]^n gives the number of ways to achieve the exponents (a, b, c). The total number of distinct products is the number of monomials (non-zero coefficients) in [G(x, y, z)]^n.

But computing [G(x, y, z)]^n directly is complicated. However, since we need the number of distinct products, which is the number of distinct (a, b, c), this would be equivalent to the number of monomials in [G(x, y, z)]^n.

However, computing this for arbitrary n is difficult. But maybe we can find a recursion or find a generating function in terms of the exponents.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find the number of distinct exponents for each prime and then multiply them, considering overlaps. But as before, the exponents are dependent due to the 6 die face.

Alternatively, let's think about the problem in terms of the possible exponents for each prime.

For prime 2: Each die can contribute 0, 1, or 2. So, the total exponent a is the sum of n independent contributions, each of which is 0, 1, or 2.

Similarly, for prime 3: Each die can contribute 0 or 1. The total exponent b is the sum of n independent contributions, each 0 or 1.

For prime 5: Each die can contribute 0 or 1. The total exponent c is the sum of n independent contributions, each 0 or 1.

But the exponents a, b, c are not independent because the contributions from each die can affect multiple primes. Specifically, a die contributing to a or b does not contribute to the other. However, a die contributing to both a and b (i.e., a 6) affects both a and b.

Therefore, the exponents a, b, c are dependent variables.

This complicates the counting. Since the exponents are dependent, the number of distinct triples (a, b, c) is not simply the product of the number of distinct a's, b's, c's.

Therefore, perhaps we can model this as a 3-dimensional problem, where each die's contribution is a vector in the (a, b, c) space, and we need to count the number of reachable points after n steps.

This is similar to counting the number of distinct points in a lattice after n steps, where each step is a vector from the set { (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (2,0,0), (0,0,1), (1,1,0) }.

This is a non-trivial problem. However, since we need to compute this for a specific n, perhaps we can find a recursion or use dynamic programming.

Let's consider using dynamic programming. Letâs define dp[k][a][b][c] as the number of ways to reach the exponents (a, b, c) after k dice. However, since we only need the count of distinct (a, b, c), perhaps we can track the set of reachable (a, b, c) instead of the number of ways.

But even tracking the set might be manageable for small n. Since 936 is a large number, n is probably not too big. Let's try to compute the number of distinct products for increasing n until we reach 936.

Starting with n=1:

n=1: The possible products are 1,2,3,4,5,6. So, 6 distinct products.

n=2: As calculated earlier, 17 distinct products.

n=3: Let's compute the number of distinct products for n=3.

Each product is the product of three dice. Each die can contribute factors as before.

But instead of listing all possible products, which is time-consuming, maybe we can compute the number of distinct triples (a, b, c) where each die contributes (x_i, y_i, z_i) as defined earlier.

Each die can contribute (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (2,0,0), (0,0,1), or (1,1,0). After three dice, the total exponents a, b, c are sums of these contributions.

We need to find the number of distinct triples (a, b, c). Let's model this as a dynamic programming problem.

We can model the state as (a, b, c), and for each die, we add one of the possible contributions. Since n=3, we need to perform three steps.

Initialize a set of possible states starting from (0,0,0). For each die, we add all possible contributions to each state, and keep track of the unique states.

But even this might be tedious. Let's see:

Starting with n=0: Only (0,0,0).

After first die (n=1): The possible states are:

(0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (2,0,0), (0,0,1), (1,1,0)

Which corresponds to the 6 possible products: 1,2,3,4,5,6.

After second die (n=2):

For each state in n=1, we add each possible contribution from the second die. So, for each existing state (a, b, c), we add (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (2,0,0), (0,0,1), (1,1,0).

Therefore, the number of states after n=2 is the union of all possible sums. We have to compute all possible (a + x, b + y, c + z) where (x, y, z) are the contributions from the second die.

But in reality, since the contributions are additive, the number of states increases, but we need to find the distinct triples.

However, computing this for n=3 manually would take a lot of time. Maybe we can find a pattern or use generating functions.

Alternatively, since the problem is asking for n such that the number of distinct products is 936, which is 936 = 6 * 8 * 19. Wait, 936 divided by 6 is 156, 156 divided by 12 is 13, so 936 = 6 * 8 * 19. Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, 936 = 24 * 39, or 36 * 26. Let's see, 936 = 12 * 78, 18 * 52, 24 * 39, 36 * 26, etc.

Alternatively, maybe 936 is the number of distinct products for n=6? Let's see.

But without computing for each n, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find a formula for the number of distinct products for n dice. Let's think.

The number of distinct products is equal to the number of distinct triples (a, b, c) where each die contributes (x_i, y_i, z_i) as before.

The exponents a, b, c can be up to 2n for a, n for b, and n for c.

But since the contributions are not independent, the number of distinct triples is not simply (2n +1)(n +1)(n +1), which would be the case if a, b, c were independent. However, due to dependencies, this number is less.

Alternatively, perhaps we can compute the number of possible a, b, c and then subtract the overlaps.

But this might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe there's a generating function approach for the number of triples.

Wait, the generating function for the number of distinct products is the same as the generating function for the number of distinct (a, b, c) triples. Each die contributes a vector, so after n dice, the generating function is [G(x, y, z)]^n, and the number of terms (monomials) in this expansion is the number of distinct products.

But computing [G(x, y, z)]^n and counting the number of terms is non-trivial. However, maybe we can use the fact that the number of distinct products is equal to the number of distinct triples (a, b, c) that can be formed by the sum of n vectors from the set { (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (2,0,0), (0,0,1), (1,1,0) }.

But even so, computing this is difficult. However, perhaps we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion or some combinatorial arguments.

Alternatively, maybe we can find that the number of distinct products for n dice is equal to the number of distinct products for n-1 dice multiplied by the number of possible contributions from the nth die, minus overlaps. But the overlaps would be complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to look for a pattern or a formula.

Wait, perhaps we can note that each die can contribute a factor of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. The product is the multiplication of these numbers. The number of distinct products is equivalent to the number of distinct multisets of factors. However, since multiplication is commutative, different orderings of the same factors result in the same product. Therefore, the number of distinct products is equal to the number of distinct multisets of factors.

But actually, no. Because different multisets can result in the same product. For example, {2,3} and {6} both result in 6. So, the number of distinct products is less than or equal to the number of distinct multisets.

But the problem is that the number of multisets is large, and many of them collide into the same product. Therefore, the number of distinct products is significantly less than the number of multisets.

Therefore, this approach might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the problem as a combinatorial one where we count the number of distinct factorizations. However, factorization into primes is unique, so the number of distinct products is equal to the number of distinct triples (a, b, c) where a, b, c are non-negative integers such that there exists a combination of dice rolls that result in 2^a * 3^b * 5^c.

Therefore, the number of distinct products is equal to the number of distinct (a, b, c) triples that can be formed by rolling n dice.

Therefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of distinct (a, b, c) triples reachable by summing n dice contributions.

Given that, we need a way to compute the number of such triples for a given n.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to use dynamic programming for each n until we reach 936. However, since this is a thought process, let's try to outline the steps.

Let's define dp[k][a][b][c] as the number of ways to reach the exponents (a, b, c) with k dice. However, since we only need the count of distinct (a, b, c), we can track a set of achievable (a, b, c) after each die.

Initialize the set with (0,0,0). Then, for each die, add all possible contributions to each current state and update the set.

But even this is time-consuming for large n. However, since 936 is the target, and each die adds a certain number of exponents, perhaps the required n is around 6 or 7.

Alternatively, let's compute the number of distinct products for n=3,4, etc., until we reach 936.

But since I can't compute this manually here, maybe I can look for a pattern.

Wait, let's check the number of distinct products for n=1:6, n=2:17, n=3: ?

Wait, let's compute n=3:

Each die can contribute to a, b, c. Let's compute all possible products for three dice.

But instead of enumerating all possible products, which is time-consuming, let's think in terms of exponents.

For each die, the possible contributions to (a, b, c) are:

(0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (2,0,0), (0,0,1), (1,1,0).

After three dice, the exponents a, b, c can be:

a: sum of three contributions, each 0,1, or 2. So, possible a: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6.

But considering contributions:

Each die can contribute 0,1, or 2 to a. Therefore, after three dice, the maximum a is 6 (3*2), and the minimum is 0 (3*0). However, not all numbers in between may be achievable.

Similarly, for b: sum of three contributions, each 0 or 1. So, possible b: 0,1,2,3.

For c: sum of three contributions, each 0 or 1. So, possible c: 0,1,2,3.

But the exponents are dependent because a die can contribute to both a and b (due to the 6 face).

Therefore, the triples (a, b, c) are not independent.

But to compute the number of distinct triples, perhaps we can use inclusion-exclusion or find a generating function.

Alternatively, maybe we can model this as a graph where each node is a state (a, b, c), and edges correspond to adding a die's contribution. Then, the number of nodes reachable after n steps is the number of distinct products.

But again, without computational tools, this is difficult.

Alternatively, maybe we can note that the number of distinct products for n dice is equal to the number of distinct products for n-1 dice multiplied by the number of possible factors from the nth die, minus overlaps. However, overlaps make this approach difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of distinct products is multiplicative in some way. For example, if we have independent contributions, the number of distinct products would be the product of the number of distinct exponents for each prime. But since the contributions are not independent, this is not the case.

Wait, another approach: The number of distinct products is equal to the number of distinct numbers that can be formed as the product of n numbers from 1 to 6. Each number from 1 to 6 is 2^a * 3^b * 5^c, where (a, b, c) are as before. Therefore, the product of n such numbers is 2^{sum a_i} * 3^{sum b_i} * 5^{sum c_i}, which is 2^A * 3^B * 5^C, where A, B, C are sums of contributions from n dice.

Therefore, the number of distinct products is equal to the number of distinct triples (A, B, C) where each die contributes (a_i, b_i, c_i) as before.

Therefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of distinct (A, B, C) triples reachable by summing n contributions.

This is similar to a problem in additive combinatorics, known as the "subset sum problem" in three dimensions. However, exact counts are difficult without computational tools.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use generating functions. Let's consider the generating function for the exponents.

The generating function for one die is:

G(x, y, z) = 1 + x + y + x^2 + z + x y

As established earlier. Then, the generating function for n dice is [G(x, y, z)]^n. The number of distinct products is equal to the number of monomials in [G(x, y, z)]^n.

However, computing [G(x, y, z)]^n and counting the number of monomials is non-trivial. However, perhaps we can use the fact that the number of monomials is equal to the number of distinct triples (A, B, C) where each die contributes (a_i, b_i, c_i) and summing over all dice.

But even so, without computational tools, it's challenging.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the logarithmic approach. The number of distinct products is equal to the number of distinct values of the product of the dice, which is equivalent to the number of distinct multisets of dice factors. However, as mentioned earlier, different multisets can result in the same product, so this is not directly helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps we can note that the number of distinct products is equal to the number of distinct numbers that can be written as the product of n numbers from 1 to 6. Therefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of distinct n-fold products from the set {1,2,3,4,5,6}.

This is similar to counting the number of distinct numbers with at most n prime factors (2,3,5) with exponents constrained by the maximum contributions from each die.

But even then, it's challenging.

Alternatively, perhaps we can look for a pattern or use the fact that the number of distinct products increases exponentially with n. Since 936 is a reasonably large number, n is likely small.

Wait, let's check n=4:

For n=3, if the number of distinct products is, say, 50, then n=4 might be around 100, and n=5 around 200, n=6 around 400, n=7 around 800, which would exceed 936. Therefore, perhaps n=7.

But this is speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the multiplicative partition function. However, multiplicative partitions count the number of ways to factor a number into products, which is the reverse of what we need.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of distinct products for n dice is equal to the number of distinct numbers of the form product_{i=1}^n x_i where x_i in {1,2,3,4,5,6}. So, we can model this as the number of distinct integers generated by multiplying n numbers from 1 to 6.

This is similar to the concept of "multiplicative energy" in additive combinatorics, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps we can note that each die can contribute a certain number of prime factors. The total exponents for 2, 3, and 5 must be achievable by summing contributions from n dice.

Each die's contribution to 2 is 0,1, or 2; to 3 is 0 or 1; to 5 is 0 or 1.

Therefore, for n dice:

Total exponents for 2: sum of 0,1, or 2, over n dice. So, possible a: 0 <= a <= 2n.

Total exponents for 3: sum of 0 or 1, over n dice. So, possible b: 0 <= b <= n.

Total exponents for 5: sum of 0 or 1, over n dice. So, possible c: 0 <= c <= n.

However, since the contributions to a, b, c are not independent (due to the 6 die face contributing to both a and b), the exponents a, b, c are dependent variables.

Therefore, the number of distinct triples (a, b, c) is not simply the product of the individual possibilities for a, b, and c.

Alternatively, maybe we can model this as a graph where each node is a state (a, b, c), and edges correspond to adding a die's contribution. Then, the number of nodes reachable after n steps is the number of distinct products. However, computing this manually is impractical.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to accept that without computational tools, it's difficult to compute the exact number of distinct products for each n, but we can make an educated guess based on the growth rate.

Given that n=1:6, n=2:17, n=3: likely around 40-50, n=4: around 80-100, n=5: around 150-200, n=6: around 300-400, n=7: around 600-800, n=8: around 1200-1500. Therefore, 936 is likely around n=7 or 8.

But this is just a rough estimate. However, since the problem states that the answer is 936, we need to find the exact n.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the formula for the number of distinct products. Wait, maybe the number of distinct products for n dice is equal to the product of (number of distinct exponents for each prime) divided by some correction factor due to overlaps. But I don't see an obvious formula.

Alternatively, perhaps we can look for the number of distinct products as follows:

Each die contributes a factor of 1,2,3,4,5,6. The number of distinct products is equal to the number of distinct numbers generated by multiplying n such factors.

This is equivalent to the number of distinct integers that can be formed as products of n integers from the set {1,2,3,4,5,6}.

This problem is similar to counting the number of distinct numbers with exponents in certain ranges, but it's non-trivial.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use inclusion-exclusion. The total number of possible products is at most 6^n, but many are duplicates. The exact count is difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use logarithms to approximate, but this is not helpful here.

Alternatively, maybe we can note that for n=7, the number of distinct products is 936. But to verify this, we need to compute it.

Alternatively, since the problem is from a math competition, perhaps there's a standard result or formula that relates the number of distinct products to n.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of distinct products is 6*5*3*... but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of distinct products for n dice is equal to the number of distinct numbers in the multiplicative semigroup generated by {1,2,3,4,5,6} with n factors.

But without more information, I can't compute this.

Alternatively, perhaps we can note that the number of distinct products for n dice is equal to the number of distinct numbers formed by multiplying n numbers from 1 to 6. This is similar to the concept of "multiplicative compositions."

However, I don't know a formula for this.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the generating function approach with the exponents. Let's consider the generating function for the exponents:

G(x, y, z) = 1 + x + y + x^2 + z + x y

Then, the generating function for n dice is [G(x, y, z)]^n. The number of distinct products is the number of monomials in this expansion.

But since we need the number of monomials, which is equivalent to the number of distinct (a, b, c) triples, we can use the fact that the number of monomials is equal to the number of distinct terms in the expansion.

However, expanding [G(x, y, z)]^n is tedious.

Alternatively, we can use the multinomial theorem. But the multinomial coefficients would give us the number of ways to achieve each (a, b, c), not the number of distinct triples.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the concept of the "support" of the polynomial, which is the set of monomials with non-zero coefficients. The size of the support is the number of distinct products. However, computing the support of [G(x, y, z)]^n is non-trivial.

Given that, perhaps the only way to proceed is to accept that without computational tools, it's difficult to compute the exact number of distinct products for each n. However, since the problem gives the answer as 936, we can infer that the required n is likely 7.

But wait, let's check for n=7:

If n=7, the number of distinct products is 936. To confirm, let's think about how many distinct products we can get.

Each die can contribute to exponents a, b, c. After 7 dice, the maximum exponents are:

a: 7*2=14

b: 7*1=7

c: 7*1=7

But the actual number of distinct triples (a, b, c) is not clear. However, 936 is a number that factors into 936= 8 * 117= 8 * 9 * 13= 2^3 * 3^2 * 13. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe we can recall that the number of distinct products for n dice is equal to the product of (number of distinct exponents for each prime) divided by some factors. But without knowing the exact formula, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps we can note that the number of distinct products for n dice is equal to the number of distinct numbers that can be written as the product of n numbers from 1 to 6. Each die contributes 1-6, so the product is between 1 and 6^n.

But even so, the number of distinct products is less than 6^n.

Given that 6^7= 279,936, which is way larger than 936. Therefore, the number of distinct products for n=7 is 936. So, n=7.

But how?

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the formula for the number of distinct products for n dice, which is equal to the number of distinct numbers in the set { product_{i=1}^n x_i | x_i in {1,2,3,4,5,6} }.

But again, without a formula or computational tool, it's difficult to compute.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is related to the fact that the number of distinct products is equal to the number of distinct numbers with prime exponents bounded by the maximum contributions from each die. But again, not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of distinct products is equal to the convolution of the exponents. However, convolution in three dimensions is complex.

Given that, I think the only way to proceed is to accept that without computational tools, it's difficult to compute the exact number of distinct products for each n. However, given that the answer is 936, and based on the earlier estimate that n=7 might result in 936, we can conclude that n=7.

But let's verify:

For n=7:

The number of distinct products is 936.

Therefore, the answer is n=7.

But to confirm, let's think of the possible exponents:

For n=7, the maximum exponent for 2 is 14, for 3 is 7, for 5 is 7.

But the number of distinct triples (a, b, c) would be the number of distinct products, which is 936. Since 936 is less than 14*7*7=686, which is not, but 936 is more than 686. Therefore, 936 is not possible for n=7.

Wait, 14*7*7=686, which is less than 936. Therefore, n=7 can't reach 936. Therefore, n must be higher.

Wait, maybe n=8:

Maximum exponents:

a: 16, b:8, c:8

Total possible triples: 16*8*8=1024, which is larger than 936. Therefore, n=8 might be possible.

But 936 is less than 1024, so maybe n=8. However, 936 is 936= 8*117= 8*9*13. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps n=6:

Maximum exponents:

a:12, b:6, c:6

Total possible triples: 12*6*6=432 < 936. Therefore, n=6 can't reach 936.

n=7: 14*7*7=686 < 936

n=8: 16*8*8=1024 > 936

Therefore, n=8 might be the required number. But 936 is less than 1024, so maybe n=8.

But the problem states the answer is 936, so we need to find n such that the number of distinct products is 936. If n=8 gives 1024, which is too big, but n=7 gives 686, which is too small. Therefore, perhaps the actual number is in between.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of distinct products grows exponentially, and 936 is achieved at n=8.

But without exact computation, it's difficult. However, given that the problem gives the answer as 936, and considering that the number of distinct products for n=7 is 686, which is less than 936, and for n=8 is 1024, which is more than 936, perhaps the exact number is 936 at n=8.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for the number of distinct products for n dice.

Alternatively, maybe we can note that the number of distinct products is equal to the number of distinct numbers of the form (x1 * x2 * ... * xn), where each xi is in {1,2,3,4,5,6}. This is similar to the concept of "multiplicative combinations."

However, I don't know a formula for this. Therefore, without computational tools, it's difficult to compute.

Given that, perhaps the answer is n=7, but based on earlier reasoning, n=7 gives 686 which is less than 936. Therefore, n=8 is the answer.

But since the problem states that the answer is 936, and given that n=8 gives 1024, which is larger than 936, but n=7 gives 686, which is smaller, perhaps the exact number is achieved somewhere in between. However, since n must be an integer, the answer is n=8.

But this is speculative. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is n=6, but 6* something=936. 936 divided by 6 is 156. But 156 is not a reasonable number for n=6.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of distinct products is 936 for n=6. Let's check:

For n=6:

Maximum exponents:

a:12, b:6, c:6

Total possible triples: 12*6*6=432 < 936. Therefore, n=6 can't reach 936.

Therefore, n must be 8.

Therefore, the answer is 8.

But since the problem states that the answer is 936, and our reasoning leads us to n=8, which gives a higher number than 936, but since 936 is the target, perhaps the correct answer is n=8.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of distinct products for n=7 is 936. Let's check:

For n=7:

Maximum a=14, b=7, c=7

Total possible triples:14*7*7=686 <936. Therefore, n=7 can't reach 936.

Therefore, n=8 is the answer.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{8}$.
