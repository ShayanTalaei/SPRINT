Okay, let me try to figure out this problem step by step. So, we have two cities, A and B, which are 45 miles apart. Alicia is living in A and Beth in B. They both start biking towards each other at the same time. Alicia's speed is 18 miles per hour, and Beth's speed is 12 miles per hour. The question is asking how many miles from City A they will meet. 

First, I need to visualize the scenario. They are starting from two points 45 miles apart and moving towards each other. Since they start at the same time, the time they spend biking until they meet should be the same. The key here is to find the time it takes for them to meet and then calculate the distance Alicia has traveled from City A in that time. 

Let me recall the basic formula for distance, which is distance equals speed multiplied by time (d = s * t). Since they are moving towards each other, their speeds add up when calculating the time until meeting. Wait, no, actually, the combined speed at which the distance between them is decreasing is the sum of their individual speeds. So the total distance between them is 45 miles, and the rate at which this distance is decreasing is 18 mph + 12 mph = 30 mph. 

So, if the distance between them decreases at 30 mph, then the time until they meet should be the total distance divided by the combined speed. Let me write that down:

Time = Total Distance / Combined Speed = 45 miles / 30 mph = 1.5 hours. 

So, they meet after 1.5 hours. Now, to find how far Alicia has traveled from City A, I can use her speed multiplied by the time. Alicia's speed is 18 mph, so:

Distance from A = 18 mph * 1.5 hours = 27 miles. 

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check. Alternatively, I could calculate how far Beth has traveled in that time and then subtract from 45 to see if it adds up. Beth's speed is 12 mph, so she covers 12 * 1.5 = 18 miles. Then, 45 - 18 = 27 miles from City A. That matches. So both methods give 27 miles. 

Alternatively, another way to approach this is to set up equations. Letâ€™s denote the time until they meet as t hours. The distance Alicia covers is 18t, and the distance Beth covers is 12t. Since the sum of these distances should be equal to 45 miles, we can write:

18t + 12t = 45

Which simplifies to 30t = 45, so t = 45/30 = 1.5 hours. Then, Alicia's distance is 18*1.5 = 27 miles. Same result. 

Hmm, seems consistent. Maybe I should check if there's another way someone might approach this problem and where they could make a mistake. For example, someone might think that since Alicia is faster, she covers more than half the distance. Half of 45 is 22.5, so 27 is indeed more than half, which makes sense because Alicia is faster. 

Another possible mistake is mixing up the speeds. If someone thought the combined speed was 18 - 12 = 6 mph, then time would be 45/6 = 7.5 hours, which is way too long. But that's incorrect because when two objects move towards each other, their relative speed is the sum, not the difference. The difference would be relevant if they were moving in the same direction. 

So, key points to remember: 

1. When moving towards each other, add the speeds.
2. When moving in the same direction, subtract the speeds.
3. The time until meeting is total distance divided by relative speed.

Applying these principles here gives the correct answer. 

I think that's thorough. Both methods confirm that they meet 27 miles from City A. Let me just recap:

- Total distance: 45 miles.
- Combined speed: 18 + 12 = 30 mph.
- Time to meet: 45 / 30 = 1.5 hours.
- Alicia's distance: 18 * 1.5 = 27 miles.
- Verification by Beth's distance: 12 * 1.5 = 18 miles. 27 + 18 = 45, which checks out.

Therefore, the answer should be 27 miles from City A.
