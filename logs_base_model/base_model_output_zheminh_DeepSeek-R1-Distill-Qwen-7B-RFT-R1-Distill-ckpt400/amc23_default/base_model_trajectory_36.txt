Okay, let's see. Carlos wants to buy running shoes, and the shoes are on sale with a 20% discount. After the discount, he also has to pay a 7.5% sales tax. He has $43. The question is asking for the original price of the most expensive shoes he can afford. Hmm, so we need to figure out the maximum original price such that after the discount and tax, it's still within his $43.

First, let me break down the problem. The original price is what we need to find. Let's denote the original price as P. The shoes are discounted by 20%, so the discounted price would be P minus 20% of P. That can be written as P * (1 - 0.20) = 0.80P. Then, on top of that discounted price, there's a 7.5% sales tax. So the total price Carlos has to pay is the discounted price plus 7.5% of the discounted price. That would be 0.80P * (1 + 0.075) = 0.80P * 1.075. 

So, the total cost after discount and tax is 0.80P * 1.075. We know that this total cost has to be less than or equal to $43. So, we can set up the inequality:

0.80P * 1.075 ≤ 43

Now, we need to solve for P. Let me compute the value of 0.80 * 1.075 first. Let's do that step by step. 0.8 multiplied by 1.075. Let's see, 1.075 is the same as 1 + 0.075. So, 0.8 * 1 = 0.8, and 0.8 * 0.075 = 0.06. Adding those together gives 0.8 + 0.06 = 0.86. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 0.8 * 1.075. Let me compute that again. 0.8 * 1 = 0.8, 0.8 * 0.075 = 0.06. So total is 0.86. So, 0.8 * 1.075 = 0.86. So, the inequality simplifies to:

0.86P ≤ 43

Therefore, to find P, we divide both sides by 0.86:

P ≤ 43 / 0.86

Calculating that, 43 divided by 0.86. Let me compute that. 0.86 times 50 is 43, because 0.86 * 50 = 43. So, 43 divided by 0.86 is 50. Therefore, P ≤ 50. So, the original price of the most expensive shoes he can afford is $50.

Wait, let me verify that. If the original price is $50, then the discount is 20%, so the discounted price is 50 * 0.8 = $40. Then, adding 7.5% tax on $40. 7.5% of 40 is 3. So, total price is 40 + 3 = $43. Perfect, that matches exactly his amount. So, the original price is $50.

But wait, let me check if there's a possibility that the original price could be slightly more than $50 but still within the $43 after discount and tax. Let's test $50.10. Then the discounted price is 50.10 * 0.8 = 40.08. Then, tax is 40.08 * 0.075 = 3.006. Total price is 40.08 + 3.006 = 43.086, which is more than $43. So, that's over. Therefore, $50 is exactly the maximum original price where after discount and tax, the total is $43. So, yes, $50 is correct.

Alternatively, maybe I should approach it algebraically again. Let's see. Let me go through the steps once more to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Original price: P

Discount: 20%, so discounted price is 0.8P

Tax: 7.5% on discounted price, so total price is 0.8P * 1.075

Total price ≤ 43

So, 0.8 * 1.075 = 0.86, so 0.86P ≤ 43

Therefore, P ≤ 43 / 0.86 = 50

Yep, that's the same result. So, the original price is $50.

Wait, but sometimes when dealing with taxes and discounts, the order can matter. For example, is the tax applied after the discount or before? But in the problem statement, it says Carlos had to pay a 7.5% sales tax on the discounted price. So, the tax is applied after the discount. So, the order is correct: discount first, then tax on the discounted amount.

So, the calculation is correct. Therefore, the original price is $50.

Alternatively, let's think of it as reverse engineering. Suppose the final price is $43. To find the original price, we need to reverse the operations. First, reverse the tax. Since the tax was 7.5%, the pre-tax amount would be 43 / 1.075. Then, reverse the discount. Since the discount was 20%, the original price would be (pre-tax amount) / 0.8.

So, let's compute that way to confirm.

First, reverse the tax: 43 / 1.075. Let's compute that. 43 divided by 1.075. Let's see, 1.075 times 40 is 43. So, 1.075 * 40 = 43. Therefore, 43 / 1.075 = 40. So, the pre-tax amount is $40.

Then, reverse the discount: 40 / 0.8 = 50. So, original price is $50. Same result. Therefore, that confirms it.

Therefore, regardless of the approach, whether applying the operations in the given order or reversing them, the original price is $50. So, the answer should be $50.

But wait, let me just check with another example. Suppose the original price is $50.

Discount: 20% of 50 is $10, so discounted price is $40.

Tax: 7.5% of $40 is $3, total price $43. Perfect.

If original price is $51, discount is 20% of 51 = $10.20, discounted price is $40.80. Tax on $40.80 is 7.5% of 40.80 = $3.06, total price $43.86, which is over $43. So, $51 is too much.

If original price is $49, discount is 20% of 49 = $9.80, discounted price is $39.20. Tax is 7.5% of 39.20 = $2.94, total price $42.14, which is under $43. So, he can afford shoes priced at $49, but not $50. Wait, but according to our previous calculation, $50 is exactly $43. So, that's correct. So, the maximum original price he can afford is $50.

Therefore, the answer is $50.
Therefore, the original price of the most expensive shoes Carlos can afford is $\boxed{50}$ dollars.
