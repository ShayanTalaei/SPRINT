Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, we have two circles in the xy-plane. The first circle has a radius of 4 and its center is on the positive x-axis. It's also tangent to the y-axis at the origin. The second circle has a radius of 10 and its center is on the positive y-axis, tangent to the x-axis at the origin. We need to find the slope of the line passing through their intersection points. The answer should be a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

First, let me visualize this. The first circle is tangent to the y-axis at (0,0), so its center must be 4 units to the right of the y-axis. Since it's on the x-axis, its center is at (4, 0). Similarly, the second circle is tangent to the x-axis at the origin, so its center is 10 units above the x-axis on the y-axis, so (0, 10).

So, the first circle has equation (x - 4)^2 + y^2 = 16, and the second circle has equation x^2 + (y - 10)^2 = 100.

We need to find the points where these two circles intersect. Then, find the slope of the line connecting those two points.

Let me start by solving the two equations simultaneously.

First equation: (x - 4)^2 + y^2 = 16

Second equation: x^2 + (y - 10)^2 = 100

Let me expand both equations.

First equation expanded: (x^2 - 8x + 16) + y^2 = 16

Simplify: x^2 - 8x + 16 + y^2 = 16

Subtract 16 from both sides: x^2 - 8x + y^2 = 0

Second equation expanded: x^2 + (y^2 - 20y + 100) = 100

Simplify: x^2 + y^2 - 20y + 100 = 100

Subtract 100: x^2 + y^2 - 20y = 0

Now we have two equations:

1) x^2 - 8x + y^2 = 0

2) x^2 + y^2 - 20y = 0

Let me subtract equation 1 from equation 2 to eliminate x^2 and y^2.

Equation 2 minus equation 1:

(x^2 + y^2 - 20y) - (x^2 - 8x + y^2) = 0 - 0

Simplify:

x^2 + y^2 - 20y - x^2 + 8x - y^2 = 0

Simplify terms:

-20y + 8x = 0

Which simplifies to:

8x - 20y = 0

Divide both sides by 4:

2x - 5y = 0

So, 2x = 5y => y = (2/5)x

Okay, so the line connecting the two intersection points has a slope of 2/5? Wait, hold on. Wait, the line connecting the two intersection points is the radical axis of the two circles. The radical axis is perpendicular to the line joining the centers of the circles.

Wait, the centers are at (4,0) and (0,10). The line connecting the centers has a slope of (10 - 0)/(0 - 4) = 10/(-4) = -5/2. So the radical axis should be perpendicular to this, so its slope should be the negative reciprocal, which is 2/5. So that matches the slope we found.

But wait, the question is asking for the slope of the line passing through the intersection points. So according to this, the slope is 2/5. Then m/n is 2/5, so m + n is 7. But that seems too straightforward. Let me check if I did everything correctly.

Wait, maybe I need to find the actual points of intersection to confirm.

So, from 2x - 5y = 0, we have y = (2/5)x. Let's substitute this into one of the original circle equations. Let's take the first circle: (x - 4)^2 + y^2 = 16.

Substitute y = (2/5)x:

(x - 4)^2 + ( (2/5)x )^2 = 16

Expand (x - 4)^2: x^2 - 8x + 16

(2/5 x)^2: (4/25)x^2

So total equation:

x^2 - 8x + 16 + (4/25)x^2 = 16

Combine like terms:

(1 + 4/25)x^2 - 8x + 16 = 16

Convert 1 to 25/25:

(25/25 + 4/25)x^2 - 8x + 16 = 16

29/25 x^2 - 8x + 16 = 16

Subtract 16 from both sides:

29/25 x^2 - 8x = 0

Factor x:

x(29/25 x - 8) = 0

So solutions are x = 0 or 29/25 x - 8 = 0 => x = (8 * 25)/29 = 200/29

If x = 0, then from y = (2/5)x, y = 0. So one solution is (0, 0). But the circles are tangent at the origin, so that must be the point of tangency. Therefore, the other intersection point is at x = 200/29.

Compute y: y = (2/5)(200/29) = (400/145) = 80/29.

So the two intersection points are (0, 0) and (200/29, 80/29). Therefore, the line connecting them goes from (0,0) to (200/29, 80/29). The slope is (80/29 - 0)/(200/29 - 0) = (80/29)/(200/29) = 80/200 = 2/5. So that's 2/5. Therefore, m = 2, n = 5, m + n = 7.

Wait, but the problem says "the line passing through the two points at which these circles intersect". The circles are tangent at the origin, so the origin is a single point of contact. The other intersection point is (200/29, 80/29). So there are two intersection points: (0,0) and (200/29, 80/29). So the line passing through both of them has slope 2/5. Therefore, the answer is 2/5, so m + n = 7.

But wait, the problem says "the line passing through the two points at which these circles intersect". If they intersect at two points, which are (0,0) and (200/29, 80/29). But the origin is a point of tangency. So maybe the circles are tangent at the origin and intersect at another point. Wait, but if they are tangent at the origin, then they have a common tangent there, so they don't intersect again. Wait, but according to the equations, substituting y = 2/5 x into the first circle gives x = 0 and x = 200/29. So actually, the circles intersect at (0,0) and (200/29, 80/29). But (0,0) is a point where both circles are tangent. So maybe the other intersection is the only other point. Therefore, the line passing through those two points is the radical axis, which is the line 2x - 5y = 0, which has slope 2/5.

But wait, let me confirm with the second circle equation. Let's plug (200/29, 80/29) into the second circle equation: x^2 + (y - 10)^2 = 100.

Compute x^2: (200/29)^2 = 40000/841

Compute (y - 10)^2: (80/29 - 290/29)^2 = (-210/29)^2 = 44100/841

Sum: 40000/841 + 44100/841 = 84100/841 = 100. Correct. So (200/29, 80/29) is indeed on both circles.

Therefore, the two intersection points are (0,0) and (200/29, 80/29). The line through these two points has slope (80/29 - 0)/(200/29 - 0) = 80/200 = 2/5. So the slope is 2/5, so m = 2, n = 5, m + n = 7.

But wait, the problem statement says "the line passing through the two points at which these circles intersect". So even though one of the intersection points is the origin, which is a point of tangency, the other is another intersection. So the line passes through both (0,0) and (200/29, 80/29). Therefore, the slope is 2/5.

But let me check if there's another intersection point. Suppose the circles intersect at two points: (0,0) and (200/29, 80/29). But if they are tangent at the origin, then they should intersect at that point with multiplicity two? Wait, but in reality, if two circles are tangent at a point, they intersect at that point with multiplicity two, but geometrically, they only touch at that point. However, in algebraic terms, solving the equations gives two solutions: (0,0) and (200/29, 80/29). Wait, but (0,0) is a solution with multiplicity two?

Wait, let's check the equations again. The first circle is (x - 4)^2 + y^2 = 16. At (0,0): (0 - 4)^2 + 0 = 16, which is 16 = 16. The second circle is x^2 + (y - 10)^2 = 100. At (0,0): 0 + (0 - 10)^2 = 100, which is 100 = 100. So (0,0) is on both circles. But are they tangent there? Let's check the derivatives at that point.

For the first circle: implicit differentiation: 2(x - 4) + 2y dy/dx = 0 => dy/dx = (4 - x)/y. At (0,0), this would be (4 - 0)/0, which is undefined. So the tangent is vertical.

For the second circle: 2x + 2(y - 10) dy/dx = 0 => dy/dx = -x/(y - 10). At (0,0), dy/dx = 0/( -10) = 0. So the tangent is horizontal.

Therefore, the two circles are tangent at (0,0), one with a vertical tangent and the other with a horizontal tangent. Therefore, they intersect at (0,0) and another point (200/29, 80/29). So the line connecting these two points is the radical axis, which has slope 2/5 as calculated. So the answer is 2/5, so m + n is 7.

Therefore, I think the answer is 7. But let me just cross-verify once again.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let's compute the equations again.

First circle: (x - 4)^2 + y^2 = 16.

Second circle: x^2 + (y - 10)^2 = 100.

Subtract the first equation from the second:

x^2 + (y - 10)^2 - [(x - 4)^2 + y^2] = 100 - 16

Expand:

x^2 + y^2 - 20y + 100 - x^2 + 8x - 16 - y^2 = 84

Simplify:

(-20y + 8x) + (100 - 16) = 84

-20y + 8x + 84 = 84

So, -20y + 8x = 0 => 8x = 20y => 2x = 5y => y = (2/5)x. Same result.

Therefore, the radical axis is y = (2/5)x. So the slope is 2/5. Therefore, the answer is 2/5, so m + n = 7.

Yeah, seems consistent. So I think the answer is 7.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{7}
Thus, the slope of the line passing through the two intersection points of the given circles is $\boxed{7}$.
