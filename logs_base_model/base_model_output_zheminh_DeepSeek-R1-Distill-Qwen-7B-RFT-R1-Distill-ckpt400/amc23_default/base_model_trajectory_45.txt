Okay, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. So, there's a 3x3 grid, and a 2x1 rectangle (which can be placed either horizontally or vertically) is covering two adjacent squares. My job is to determine the minimum number of turns needed to guarantee that at least one of my guesses is covered by the rectangle. Each turn, I can guess a square, and I'll be told if it's covered. The goal is to find the smallest number of guesses required to ensure that at least one of them is part of the hidden rectangle, regardless of where the rectangle is placed.

First, let me visualize the 3x3 grid. It has 9 squares arranged in 3 rows and 3 columns. The possible positions for the 2x1 rectangle are either horizontal or vertical. Let's count how many possible positions there are.

For horizontal rectangles: In each row, there are two possible horizontal positions (since each row has three squares, so two adjacent pairs). There are three rows, so 3 rows * 2 positions = 6 horizontal rectangles.

For vertical rectangles: Similarly, in each column, there are two vertical positions. There are three columns, so 3 columns * 2 positions = 6 vertical rectangles.

So in total, there are 6 + 6 = 12 possible rectangles.

Each rectangle covers two squares, so there are 12 possible pairs of squares. My task is to choose a set of squares such that every possible rectangle's pair of squares is covered by at least one square in my set. Then, the size of this set will be the minimum number of turns needed. Because if I guess all the squares in this set, then regardless of where the rectangle is, I'll have guessed at least one of its squares. The minimal size of such a set is called the "hitting set" in combinatorics.

Alternatively, the problem can be thought of as covering all possible rectangle positions with the fewest number of squares. Each square I choose can "cover" or "hit" multiple rectangles. So, the challenge is to find the smallest number of squares such that every possible 2x1 rectangle includes at least one of these squares.

So, let's model this. Let's represent the grid with coordinates. Let's say rows are numbered 1 to 3 and columns 1 to 3. So the squares are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), ..., (3,3).

Each rectangle is either horizontal or vertical. For example, a horizontal rectangle in row 1 could be covering (1,1)-(1,2) or (1,2)-(1,3). Similarly, vertical rectangles in column 1 could be (1,1)-(2,1) or (2,1)-(3,1), etc.

We need to pick a set of squares such that every possible horizontal or vertical domino (2x1 rectangle) includes at least one square from this set. The minimal size of such a set is the answer.

This is equivalent to finding a vertex cover in the graph where vertices are squares and edges are the dominoes (each domino is an edge connecting two adjacent squares). A vertex cover is a set of vertices such that every edge has at least one endpoint in the set. The minimal vertex cover is the smallest such set. However, in this case, the graph is the 3x3 grid graph, where each vertex is connected to its adjacent vertices (horizontally and vertically). So the problem reduces to finding the minimum vertex cover of a 3x3 grid graph.

Wait, but vertex cover is usually for edges, but here we need a hitting set for the dominoes. Each domino is an edge (two vertices connected), so a hitting set for all edges is exactly a vertex cover. So yes, the minimum vertex cover of the 3x3 grid graph is the answer.

Now, I need to recall or compute the minimum vertex cover for a 3x3 grid. Let me think. For a bipartite graph, the size of the minimum vertex cover is equal to the maximum matching by Konig's theorem. But the 3x3 grid is a bipartite graph. Let me check.

Yes, the grid graph is bipartite. For a 3x3 grid, the vertices can be colored in a checkerboard pattern, black and white alternately. Then, edges only go between black and white. So, Konig's theorem applies here: the size of the minimum vertex cover equals the size of the maximum matching.

So if I can find the maximum matching in the 3x3 grid graph, then that will give me the size of the minimum vertex cover.

Alternatively, maybe there's a known result for the 3x3 grid. Let me try to visualize the grid. It's a 3x3 grid, so 9 vertices. Each vertex has up to 4 neighbors (except edge and corner vertices). Let's try to find a maximum matching.

A matching is a set of edges with no shared vertices. The maximum matching is the largest such set.

In the 3x3 grid, let's try to find a matching. Let's pair up squares diagonally. For example, pair (1,1) with (1,2), but wait, that's adjacent horizontally. Wait, no, in a matching, edges are the dominoes. Wait, no, in this case, the edges of the graph are the domino positions. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the dominoes with the edges.

Wait, in the graph, each domino is an edge. So a matching is a set of dominoes (edges) that don't share any squares (vertices). So the maximum matching is the largest set of dominoes that don't overlap. Then, the minimum vertex cover is the minimum number of squares that intersect all dominoes.

So, Konig's theorem tells us that in bipartite graphs, the size of the minimum vertex cover equals the size of the maximum matching. So if I can find a maximum matching of size m, then the minimum vertex cover is also m.

So, let's try to find the maximum matching in the 3x3 grid. Let's see.

In a 3x3 grid, how many dominoes are there? For horizontal dominoes: 3 rows, 2 per row, so 6. For vertical dominoes: 3 columns, 2 per column, so 6. Total 12 dominoes.

But a matching is a set of dominoes that don't share any squares. So, each domino uses two squares, and no two dominoes in the matching can share a square.

What's the maximum number of dominoes we can place without overlapping? Let's try to place as many as possible.

One approach is to tile the grid with dominoes. However, a 3x3 grid has 9 squares, which is odd, so it's impossible to tile entirely with dominoes. The maximum number of dominoes in a matching can't exceed floor(9/2) = 4. But maybe even less.

Wait, actually, in a 3x3 grid, the maximum matching is 4. Let's see. Let me try to arrange 4 dominoes without overlapping.

Let's place horizontal dominoes in rows 1 and 2:

- Row 1: (1,1)-(1,2)
- Row 1: (1,2)-(1,3) [Wait, but that would overlap with the first domino. So maybe only one domino per row.]

Wait, maybe a better way is to alternate horizontal and vertical dominoes.

For example:

- Place a horizontal domino in row 1, covering (1,1)-(1,2)
- Place a vertical domino in column 2, covering (1,2)-(2,2)
- Place a horizontal domino in row 2, covering (2,2)-(2,3)
- Place a vertical domino in column 1, covering (1,1)-(2,1)
- Place a vertical domino in column 3, covering (2,3)-(3,3)

Wait, but this might overlap. Let me check.

Wait, let's try to place dominoes without overlapping.

Let me try to place dominoes in the four corners:

- Place a horizontal domino in row 1, columns 1-2: covers (1,1)-(1,2)
- Place a vertical domino in column 3, rows 1-2: covers (1,3)-(2,3)
- Place a horizontal domino in row 3, columns 2-3: covers (3,2)-(3,3)
- Place a vertical domino in column 1, rows 2-3: covers (2,1)-(3,1)

Wait, but then the center square (2,2) is not covered. But dominoes only need to be placed in matching positions. Wait, but each domino is an edge in the matching, so they are placed on edges, not on squares. Wait, no, in the matching, each domino is an edge, so each domino is a pair of adjacent squares. So in the matching, each domino is a pair, and no two dominoes share a square.

So, in this case, if I place four dominoes as follows:

1. (1,1)-(1,2)
2. (2,1)-(3,1)
3. (2,3)-(3,3)
4. (1,3)-(2,3)

Wait, but domino 4 overlaps with domino 3 at (2,3). So that's not allowed. Hmm.

Alternatively:

1. (1,1)-(1,2)
2. (1,3)-(2,3)
3. (3,1)-(3,2)
4. (3,3)-(2,3) [But this would overlap with domino 2 at (2,3).]

Alternatively, maybe:

1. (1,1)-(2,1) [vertical]
2. (1,2)-(1,3) [horizontal]
3. (2,2)-(3,2) [vertical]
4. (3,1)-(3,2) [horizontal]

But then domino 4 is (3,1)-(3,2), which overlaps with domino 3 at (3,2). So again, overlapping.

Alternatively, maybe:

1. (1,1)-(2,1)
2. (1,2)-(2,2)
3. (2,2)-(3,2)
4. (3,1)-(3,2)

But again, domino 4 overlaps with domino 3 at (3,2). Not allowed.

Hmm, maybe this approach is not working. Let me think differently.

In a 3x3 grid, the maximum matching. Let's consider that the grid has 9 squares. Each domino uses 2 squares. A matching is a set of dominoes that don't share squares. So, maximum possible is floor(9/2) = 4 dominoes, but since 4*2=8 squares, leaving one square. But is that possible?

Wait, but in a bipartite graph, the maximum matching can't exceed the size of the smaller partition. Let's check the bipartition.

In the 3x3 grid, if we color it like a checkerboard, we have 5 squares of one color and 4 of the other. For example:

B W B

W B W

B W B

So, the black squares are 5 and white squares are 4. In bipartite graphs, the maximum matching is at most the size of the smaller partition, which is 4. So, the maximum matching is 4. Therefore, by Konig's theorem, the minimum vertex cover is also 4.

Therefore, the minimum vertex cover is 4. So, the answer is 4. Therefore, the minimum number of turns needed is 4.

But let me verify this by trying to find such a vertex cover. Let's pick four squares such that every domino includes at least one of them.

Possible candidate squares: Let's choose the four corner squares: (1,1), (1,3), (3,1), (3,3). Let's see if they form a vertex cover.

Check all horizontal dominoes:

- Row 1: (1,1)-(1,2) covers (1,1)
- (1,2)-(1,3) covers (1,3)
- Row 2: (2,1)-(2,2) doesn't cover any corner squares
- (2,2)-(2,3) doesn't cover any corner squares
- Row 3: (3,1)-(3,2) covers (3,1)
- (3,2)-(3,3) covers (3,3)

So, vertical dominoes:

- Column 1: (1,1)-(2,1) covers (1,1)
- (2,1)-(3,1) covers (3,1)
- Column 2: (1,2)-(2,2) doesn't cover any corner squares
- (2,2)-(3,2) doesn't cover any corner squares
- Column 3: (1,3)-(2,3) covers (1,3)
- (2,3)-(3,3) covers (3,3)

Wait, but the domino (2,1)-(3,1) is vertical, which covers (2,1) and (3,1). But (3,1) is in our vertex cover. So, that domino is covered. Similarly, the domino (2,3)-(3,3) is covered by (3,3).

But what about the domino (2,2)-(3,2)? It's horizontal in row 3, but it's (2,2)-(3,2). Wait, that's a vertical domino? Wait, no, (2,2) and (3,2) are in the same column, so it's a vertical domino. So, in column 2, the domino (2,2)-(3,2) is vertical. But neither (2,2) nor (3,2) are in the vertex cover. So, this domino is not covered by the vertex cover of the four corners. Therefore, the four corner squares are not a vertex cover.

Hmm, so that approach doesn't work. So maybe the four corners are not sufficient.

Let me try another set. Let's pick the four edge centers: (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2). Let's check if they form a vertex cover.

Check horizontal dominoes:

- Row 1: (1,1)-(1,2) covers (1,2)
- (1,2)-(1,3) covers (1,2)
- Row 2: (2,1)-(2,2) covers (2,1)
- (2,2)-(2,3) covers (2,3)
- Row 3: (3,1)-(3,2) covers (3,2)
- (3,2)-(3,3) covers (3,2)

Vertical dominoes:

- Column 1: (1,1)-(2,1) covers (2,1)
- (2,1)-(3,1) covers (2,1)
- Column 2: (1,2)-(2,2) covers (1,2)
- (2,2)-(3,2) covers (3,2)
- Column 3: (1,3)-(2,3) covers (2,3)
- (2,3)-(3,3) covers (2,3)

So, every domino seems to be covered by at least one square in the set { (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2) }. Let's confirm:

Take domino (2,2)-(3,2): covers (3,2)
Domino (1,1)-(1,2): covers (1,2)
Domino (2,1)-(3,1): covers (2,1)
Domino (2,2)-(3,2): covered
Domino (2,3)-(3,3): covers (2,3)
Domino (1,3)-(2,3): covers (2,3)
Domino (1,2)-(1,3): covers (1,2)
Domino (2,1)-(2,2): covers (2,1)
Domino (2,2)-(2,3): covers (2,3)
Domino (3,1)-(3,2): covers (3,2)
Domino (3,2)-(3,3): covers (3,2)

Yes, every domino is covered by at least one square in the set { (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2) }. Therefore, this is a vertex cover of size 4. Therefore, the minimum vertex cover is indeed 4. So, the minimum number of turns needed is 4.

But let me check if there's a vertex cover with 3 squares. Suppose we try 3 squares. Let's see if it's possible. Let's pick (1,2), (2,1), (3,2). Let's check if this covers all dominoes.

Check horizontal dominoes:

- (1,1)-(1,2): covers (1,2)
- (1,2)-(1,3): covers (1,2)
- (2,1)-(2,2): covers (2,1)
- (2,2)-(2,3): does not cover any of these three squares. So, domino (2,2)-(2,3) is not covered. So, this set doesn't work.

Alternatively, pick (1,2), (2,2), (3,2). Let's check:

- Horizontal dominoes: (1,1)-(1,2) covers (1,2); (1,2)-(1,3) covers (1,2); (2,1)-(2,2) covers (2,2); (2,2)-(2,3) covers (2,2); (3,1)-(3,2) covers (3,2); (3,2)-(3,3) covers (3,2). All horizontal dominoes are covered.

Vertical dominoes:

- (1,1)-(2,1): doesn't cover any of these squares.
- (2,1)-(3,1): doesn't cover any.
- (1,2)-(2,2) covers (2,2)
- (2,2)-(3,2) covers (3,2)
- (1,3)-(2,3): doesn't cover any.
- (2,3)-(3,3): doesn't cover any.

So, vertical dominoes (1,1)-(2,1), (2,1)-(3,1), (1,3)-(2,3), (2,3)-(3,3) are not covered. Therefore, this set of three squares is insufficient.

Another attempt: pick (1,2), (2,1), (2,3). Let's check:

Horizontal dominoes: as before, (2,2)-(2,3) is covered by (2,3). (1,1)-(1,2) by (1,2), etc.

Vertical dominoes:

- (1,1)-(2,1) is covered by (2,1)
- (2,1)-(3,1): not covered
- (1,3)-(2,3) is covered by (2,3)
- (2,3)-(3,3): not covered

So, dominoes (2,1)-(3,1) and (2,3)-(3,3) are not covered. So, three squares are insufficient.

Alternatively, pick (1,2), (2,2), (3,2). As before, vertical dominoes on the left and right columns are not covered.

Alternatively, pick (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). Then, vertical dominoes in columns 1, 2, 3 are covered, but horizontal dominoes in the middle row are covered, but the horizontal dominoes in the top and bottom rows are not covered. For example, (1,1)-(1,2) is not covered by any of these three. So, horizontal dominoes in rows 1 and 3 are not covered.

Hence, it seems impossible to cover all dominoes with only 3 squares. Therefore, 4 is indeed the minimum.

Therefore, the answer is 4. So, the minimum number of turns required is 4.

But wait, let me check again if there's a smarter way. Suppose we pick the four edge centers: (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2). As we saw earlier, this set covers all dominoes. So, four squares. Is there any way to cover all dominoes with three squares? It seems not, as any three squares would miss some dominoes in either the horizontal or vertical directions.

For example, if we leave out a square from one of the four, then the domino that uses that square and another square not in the set would not be covered. So, yes, four is the minimum.

Therefore, the answer is 4. So, the minimum number of turns needed is 4.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{4}
Thus, the minimum number of turns required to ensure that at least one of your guessed squares is covered by the rectangle is $\boxed{4}$.
