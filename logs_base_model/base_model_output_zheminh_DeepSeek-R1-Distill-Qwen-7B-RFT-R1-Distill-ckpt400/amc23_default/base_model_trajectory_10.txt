Okay, let's see. I need to solve this logarithmic equation: log_{7x}2023 multiplied by log_{289x}2023 equals log_{2023x}2023. Then find the product of all solutions. Hmm, logarithms with different bases. I remember that logarithms can be converted using the change of base formula, which might help here. Let me recall the change of base formula: log_b a = log_c a / log_c b. So maybe I can express all these logs with the same base, maybe base 2023? Let's try that.

First, let me rewrite each logarithm using base 2023. So, log_{7x}2023 becomes log_{2023}2023 / log_{2023}7x. Similarly, log_{289x}2023 would be log_{2023}2023 / log_{2023}289x, and log_{2023x}2023 would be log_{2023}2023 / log_{2023}2023x. Let me write that out:

Left side: [log_{2023}2023 / log_{2023}7x] * [log_{2023}2023 / log_{2023}289x]

Right side: [log_{2023}2023 / log_{2023}2023x]

I know that log_{2023}2023 is 1, since any log base a of a is 1. So simplifying the left side:

1 / log_{2023}7x multiplied by 1 / log_{2023}289x, so left side becomes 1 / [log_{2023}7x * log_{2023}289x]

Right side is 1 / log_{2023}2023x

So the equation simplifies to:

1 / [log_{2023}7x * log_{2023}289x] = 1 / log_{2023}2023x

Taking reciprocals on both sides:

log_{2023}7x * log_{2023}289x = log_{2023}2023x

Hmm, okay. Now, let's let’s denote y = log_{2023}x. Then, log_{2023}7x is log_{2023}7 + log_{2023}x = log_{2023}7 + y. Similarly, log_{2023}289x is log_{2023}289 + y. And log_{2023}2023x is log_{2023}2023 + log_{2023}x = 1 + y.

So substituting these into the equation:

(log_{2023}7 + y)(log_{2023}289 + y) = 1 + y

Let me compute the left side:

First, expand the product:

log_{2023}7 * log_{2023}289 + log_{2023}7 * y + log_{2023}289 * y + y^2 = 1 + y

Bring all terms to one side:

log_{2023}7 * log_{2023}289 + (log_{2023}7 + log_{2023}289)y + y^2 - 1 - y = 0

Combine like terms:

y^2 + [log_{2023}7 + log_{2023}289 - 1]y + [log_{2023}7 * log_{2023}289 - 1] = 0

This is a quadratic in y. Let's denote coefficients:

A = 1

B = log_{2023}7 + log_{2023}289 - 1

C = log_{2023}7 * log_{2023}289 - 1

So the quadratic equation is Ay² + By + C = 0. The solutions for y will be [ -B ± sqrt(B² - 4AC) ] / 2A. The product of the solutions to a quadratic equation Ay² + By + C = 0 is C/A. So the product of the solutions for y is C, which is log_{2023}7 * log_{2023}289 - 1.

But remember, y = log_{2023}x. So each solution y corresponds to x = 2023^y. Therefore, the solutions x are 2023^{y1} and 2023^{y2}, where y1 and y2 are the roots of the quadratic equation. The product of these solutions is 2023^{y1} * 2023^{y2} = 2023^{y1 + y2}.

But wait, from the quadratic equation, the sum of the roots y1 + y2 = -B/A. Since A=1, y1 + y2 = -B. So the product of the solutions x is 2023^{-B}.

Alternatively, since the product of the solutions x is 2023^{y1} * 2023^{y2} = 2023^{y1 + y2} = 2023^{-B}.

But let's check this. Alternatively, since x1 = 2023^{y1} and x2 = 2023^{y2}, then x1*x2 = 2023^{y1 + y2}. Since y1 + y2 = -B, then x1*x2 = 2023^{-B}.

But let's compute B and then find 2023^{-B}. Alternatively, since the product of solutions in terms of x would be x1*x2 = 2023^{-B}.

But maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, since the original equation is transformed into a quadratic in y, where y = log_{2023}x. The product of the solutions for x is 2023^{y1 + y2} = 2023^{-B}.

But let's compute B first. B = log_{2023}7 + log_{2023}289 - 1.

Note that 289 is 17², right? 17*17=289. And 2023 is 7*17², because 7*289=2023. Let me confirm: 289*7=2023. 289*7: 200*7=1400, 80*7=560, 9*7=63; 1400+560=1960+63=2023. Yes, correct. So 2023=7*17². So log_{2023}2023=1, which is log base 2023 of 2023 is 1.

So log_{2023}289: since 289=17², log_{2023}17² = 2 log_{2023}17.

Similarly, log_{2023}7 is just log_{2023}7.

Therefore, B = log_{2023}7 + 2 log_{2023}17 - 1.

But log_{2023}7 + log_{2023}17 = log_{2023}(7*17) = log_{2023}119.

Wait, 7*17=119. So log_{2023}7 + log_{2023}17 = log_{2023}119. But we have 2 log_{2023}17, so B = log_{2023}119 + log_{2023}17 -1.

Wait, maybe not. Let me check:

Original B is log_{2023}7 + log_{2023}289 -1. Since 289=17², log_{2023}289=2 log_{2023}17. So B= log_{2023}7 + 2 log_{2023}17 -1.

Alternatively, 2023=7*17², so log_{2023}7 + log_{2023}17² = log_{2023}(7*17²) = log_{2023}2023 =1. Therefore, log_{2023}7 + log_{2023}289=1. Wait, that's interesting.

Wait, log_{2023}7 + log_{2023}289 = log_{2023}(7*289) = log_{2023}(2023)=1. Exactly. So that sum is 1. Therefore, B=1 -1=0? Wait, hold on.

Wait, B = log_{2023}7 + log_{2023}289 -1. Since log_{2023}7 + log_{2023}289 =1, then B=1 -1=0. So B=0. Therefore, the quadratic equation becomes y² + 0*y + C = y² + C =0. Therefore, solutions are y= sqrt(-C) and y=-sqrt(-C), but depending on C. Wait, but C is log_{2023}7 * log_{2023}289 -1. Let's compute C.

C = log_{2023}7 * log_{2023}289 -1.

Again, since 289=17², log_{2023}289=2 log_{2023}17. So C = log_{2023}7 * 2 log_{2023}17 -1.

But earlier, we saw that log_{2023}7 + log_{2023}289=1. Let me denote log_{2023}7 as a and log_{2023}17 as b. Then, a + 2b =1. Also, C= a*(2b) -1=2ab -1.

But since a + 2b =1, perhaps we can express ab in terms of a or b.

Alternatively, maybe express in terms of a. Let's see. Let me note that 2023=7*17², so 7=2023/(17²). Therefore, log_{2023}7 = log_{2023}(2023/(17²))= log_{2023}2023 - log_{2023}17²=1 - 2 log_{2023}17=1 -2b. Therefore, a=1 -2b.

So, substituting a=1-2b into C:

C= a*(2b) -1= (1 -2b)(2b) -1=2b -4b² -1.

But also, from a +2b=1, which is (1 -2b) +2b=1, which is consistent. So we have:

C=2b -4b² -1.

But we need to compute C. Alternatively, maybe express in terms of a. Let's see. Since a=1 -2b, then b=(1 -a)/2. Substitute into C:

C=2b -4b² -1=2*( (1 -a)/2 ) -4*( (1 -a)/2 )² -1= (1 -a) -4*( (1 -2a +a²)/4 ) -1= (1 -a) - (1 -2a +a²) -1=1 -a -1 +2a -a² -1= (1 -1 -1) + (-a +2a) -a²= (-1) + a -a².

So C= -a² +a -1. But not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe compute C numerically? Wait, but maybe we can relate C to another expression.

Alternatively, note that 2023=7*17². Therefore, the logarithm base 2023 of 7 is log_{2023}7 = log_{7*17²}7 = 1 / log_7(2023) = 1 / log_7(7*17²) = 1 / [1 + log_7(17²)] = 1 / [1 + 2 log_7(17)].

Similarly, log_{2023}17 = log_{7*17²}17 = log_17(17) / log_17(7*17²) =1 / [log_17(7) + 2]. Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, since 2023=7*17², then log_{2023}7 = log_{7*17²}7 = 1 / log_7(2023) = 1 / [log_7(7) + log_7(17²)] = 1 / [1 + 2 log_7(17)]. Similarly, log_{2023}17 = 1 / log_{17}(2023) = 1 / [log_{17}(7) + log_{17}(17²)] = 1 / [log_{17}7 + 2].

But maybe there's a relationship here. Let me denote log_7 17 as k. Then, log_{17}7 = 1/k. So log_{2023}7 =1 / [1 + 2k], and log_{2023}17=1/[1/k +2] =k / (1 + 2k). Therefore, log_{2023}7 * log_{2023}17 = [1 / (1 + 2k)] * [k / (1 + 2k)] =k / (1 + 2k)^2.

Therefore, C= log_{2023}7 * log_{2023}289 -1 = [k / (1 + 2k)^2] -1. But log_{2023}289 is 2 log_{2023}17=2*[k / (1 + 2k)].

Wait, maybe this is overcomplicating. Let's think differently. Since 2023=7*17², then log_{2023}7 = log_{7*17²}7=1 / (1 + 2 log_7 17). Let me denote log_7 17 as a. Then log_{2023}7=1/(1 + 2a). Similarly, log_{2023}17= log_{7*17²}17=1 / (log_17(7) + 2). But log_17(7)=1/a. Therefore, log_{2023}17=1/(1/a +2)=a/(1 + 2a). Therefore, log_{2023}7 * log_{2023}17= [1/(1 + 2a)] * [a/(1 + 2a)]=a / (1 + 2a)^2. Therefore, C= a / (1 + 2a)^2 -1.

But from the original equation, we have that log_{2023}7 + log_{2023}289=1. Which is log_{2023}7 + 2 log_{2023}17=1. Substituting the expressions above:

1/(1 + 2a) + 2*(a/(1 + 2a)) =1.

Compute left side:

1/(1 + 2a) + 2a/(1 + 2a) = [1 + 2a]/(1 + 2a) =1. Which checks out. So that's consistent.

But we need to compute C= a / (1 + 2a)^2 -1. Hmm. Let's compute this:

C= [a - (1 + 2a)^2] / (1 + 2a)^2.

Compute numerator:

a - (1 + 4a +4a²)= a -1 -4a -4a²= -1 -3a -4a².

Therefore, C= (-1 -3a -4a²)/(1 + 2a)^2.

But I'm not sure if this helps. Maybe there's another approach. Let's recall that the product of the solutions for x is 2023^{-B}, and we found that B=0. Therefore, the product of the solutions is 2023^{-0}=1. Wait, so if B=0, then x1*x2=2023^{-0}=1. Therefore, the product of all solutions is 1?

But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me verify. If the quadratic equation in y has solutions y1 and y2, then the product of the solutions x1 and x2 is 2023^{y1 + y2}. But since B=0, y1 + y2 = -B =0. Therefore, x1*x2=2023^0=1. So the product is 1. So regardless of the value of C, the product is 1? That seems surprising. Let me check with a simple case.

Suppose the equation is transformed into a quadratic in y, and the sum of the solutions for y is -B, which is zero here. Then the sum of the solutions for y is zero, hence y1 + y2=0. Therefore, x1=2023^{y1}, x2=2023^{y2}=2023^{-y1}. Therefore, x1*x2=2023^{y1 - y1}=2023^0=1. Yes, that's correct. Therefore, the product is indeed 1. Therefore, the answer is 1.

But let me check if all steps are correct. Let's go back.

Original equation:

log_{7x}2023 * log_{289x}2023 = log_{2023x}2023.

Convert each logarithm to base 2023:

log_{7x}2023 = log_{2023}2023 / log_{2023}7x =1 / log_{2023}7x.

Similarly, log_{289x}2023=1 / log_{2023}289x, and log_{2023x}2023=1 / log_{2023}2023x.

Therefore, the equation becomes:

[1 / log_{2023}7x] * [1 / log_{2023}289x] = 1 / log_{2023}2023x.

Take reciprocals:

log_{2023}7x * log_{2023}289x = log_{2023}2023x.

Express logs as sums:

log_{2023}7 + log_{2023}x multiplied by log_{2023}289 + log_{2023}x = log_{2023}2023 + log_{2023}x.

Let y = log_{2023}x. Then:

(log_{2023}7 + y)(log_{2023}289 + y) =1 + y.

Expanding left side:

log_{2023}7 * log_{2023}289 + y log_{2023}7 + y log_{2023}289 + y² =1 + y.

Rearranging:

y² + y(log_{2023}7 + log_{2023}289) + log_{2023}7 * log_{2023}289 -1 - y=0.

Which gives:

y² + [log_{2023}7 + log_{2023}289 -1]y + [log_{2023}7 * log_{2023}289 -1]=0.

We found that log_{2023}7 + log_{2023}289=1, so the coefficient of y is zero. Therefore, the equation becomes:

y² + [log_{2023}7 * log_{2023}289 -1]=0.

Thus, the quadratic equation is y² + C =0, where C=log_{2023}7 * log_{2023}289 -1.

Therefore, solutions for y are y= sqrt(-C) and y=-sqrt(-C), but only if -C is non-negative. So assuming that C ≤0, but let's compute C:

C= log_{2023}7 * log_{2023}289 -1.

As 2023=7*17², so log_{2023}7=1/(1 + 2 log_7 17), and log_{2023}289=2 log_{2023}17=2/(log_{17}2023 +2). Wait, this seems complicated.

Alternatively, note that 2023=7*17², so 7=2023/(17²). Therefore, log_{2023}7= log_{2023}(2023/(17²))=1 -2 log_{2023}17. Similarly, log_{2023}289= log_{2023}(17²)=2 log_{2023}17. Let me denote log_{2023}17 as t. Then, log_{2023}7=1 -2t, and log_{2023}289=2t. Then, C=(1 -2t)(2t) -1= 2t -4t² -1.

Thus, C= -4t² +2t -1.

Now, substitute back into the quadratic equation: y² + (-4t² +2t -1)=0. So y²=4t² -2t +1.

But we need to check if this is possible. Wait, but for real solutions, the discriminant must be non-negative. However, in the original problem, the logarithms are defined only when their arguments are positive. Since logarithm bases must be positive and not equal to 1. So 7x >0, 7x ≠1; 289x >0, 289x ≠1; and 2023x >0, 2023x ≠1. So x>0, x≠1/7, x≠1/289, x≠1/2023. But these restrictions are already accounted for in the logarithms.

But back to the equation. So the quadratic equation in y is y² + C=0. If C is negative, then y²= -C would have real solutions. Let's compute C:

C= -4t² +2t -1.

But t= log_{2023}17. Let's compute t:

Since 2023=7*17², so log_{2023}17= log_{7*17²}17= [log_7 17] / [log_7 2023]. Wait, no. Wait, log_{ab}c= log_a c / log_a b. Therefore, log_{2023}17= log_7 17 / log_7 2023.

But log_7 2023= log_7 (7*17²)=1 +2 log_7 17. Let me denote log_7 17 as s. Then log_7 2023=1 +2s. Therefore, log_{2023}17= s/(1 +2s). Therefore, t= s/(1 +2s).

Substitute into C= -4t² +2t -1:

C= -4*(s/(1 +2s))² +2*(s/(1 +2s)) -1.

Let me compute this:

First term: -4*(s²)/(1 +2s)^2.

Second term: 2s/(1 +2s).

Third term: -1.

Combine all terms over a common denominator (1 +2s)^2:

[ -4s² + 2s(1 +2s) - (1 +2s)^2 ] / (1 +2s)^2.

Expand numerator:

-4s² +2s +4s² - [1 +4s +4s²] = (-4s² +4s²) +2s -1 -4s -4s²= 0 -2s -1 -4s²= -4s² -2s -1.

Therefore, C= (-4s² -2s -1)/(1 +2s)^2.

But s=log_7 17. Let's compute s:

s= log_7 17. Since 7^1=7, 7^2=49, 17 is between 7^1 and 7^2. So s is between 1 and 2. Let's approximate s:

log_7 17= ln17 / ln7 ≈2.8332 /1.9459≈1.457.

So s≈1.457.

Therefore, numerator: -4*(1.457)^2 -2*(1.457) -1≈-4*(2.123) -2.914 -1≈-8.492 -2.914 -1≈-12.406.

Denominator: (1 +2*1.457)^2≈(1 +2.914)^2≈(3.914)^2≈15.313.

Therefore, C≈-12.406 /15.313≈-0.810.

Therefore, C≈-0.810. So quadratic equation becomes y² -0.810≈0, so y≈±sqrt(0.810)≈±0.900. Therefore, real solutions exist. Therefore, the original equation has real solutions.

Therefore, the solutions for x are 2023^{0.900} and 2023^{-0.900}, so their product is 2023^{0.900} *2023^{-0.900}=2023^0=1. Therefore, the product of all solutions is 1.

Therefore, the answer is 1. So the product of all solutions is 1. So regardless of the actual values, the product is 1.

Alternatively, since we earlier deduced that the product of the solutions is 2023^{-B}=2023^0=1, since B=0, so that's a more straightforward way. So this seems consistent.

Therefore, the product is 1. So the final answer is \boxed{1}.
Therefore, the product of all solutions to the equation is $\boxed{1}$.
