Okay, so I have this problem about Coinland where the coins are 6, 10, and 15 cents. I need to find the largest amount of money that can't be made using these coins, and then find the sum of the digits of that amount. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember something called the Frobenius Coin Problem, which is about finding the largest monetary amount that cannot be obtained using any combination of coins of specified denominations. But I think that problem is mainly for two coins. For three or more coins, there isn't a general formula, so maybe I need to approach it differently here.

Let me start by listing out the amounts that can be made with these coins. Maybe I can find a pattern or see if there's a point beyond which all amounts can be formed. If I can find that point, then the largest amount before it would be the answer.

Since the coins are 6, 10, and 15, let's see if there's a common divisor. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 6, 10, and 15. Let's compute that. The GCD of 6 and 10 is 2, then GCD of 2 and 15 is 1. So the overall GCD is 1. That means, according to the Frobenius problem, there should be a largest non-makable amount. Since the GCD is 1, any sufficiently large amount can be formed. So, the key is to find that largest amount that can't be formed.

One strategy is to check each number starting from 1 upwards and see if it can be expressed as a combination of 6, 10, and 15. Once I find a sequence of consecutive numbers equal to the GCD (which is 1 here), I can be sure that beyond that point, all numbers can be formed. But since 1 is the GCD, actually, once you have a run of 1 consecutive numbers, which would just be any single number, but maybe I need to check up to the point where I can make 6 consecutive numbers? Wait, no, because the GCD is 1, so once you can make a consecutive run of numbers equal to the GCD, which is 1, then you can make every number beyond that. But maybe that's not the correct approach here.

Alternatively, since the problem is with three coins, perhaps I can break it down. Let me see. Maybe start by considering the problem with just two coins first, then see how adding the third affects it. For example, if I take 6 and 10, their GCD is 2. Then, with 15, which is coprime with 6 and 10 (since GCD(15,6)=3, GCD(15,10)=5). Hmm, maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, maybe I can check each residue modulo the smallest coin, which is 6. That is, for each residue r (0 to 5), find the smallest number that can be formed with 10 and 15 for that residue. Then, the largest number that can't be formed would be the maximum of (smallest number for residue r) - 6 -1. Wait, maybe not. Let me recall the method for the two-coin problem.

In the two-coin problem with denominations a and b, where GCD(a,b)=d, the largest number that can't be formed is ab/d - a - b. But here, with three coins, it's not straightforward. However, perhaps using the method of residues.

Let me try to approach it step by step. Let's list numbers starting from 1 and see which can be formed.

But that might take a while. Maybe I can find the largest number that can't be expressed as 6a + 10b + 15c, where a, b, c are non-negative integers.

Alternatively, since 15 is a multiple of 5 and 3, maybe I can think in terms of 5 and 3. Wait, 6 is 2*3, 10 is 2*5, 15 is 3*5. So maybe this problem is related to the combination of 2, 3, and 5. Hmm, not sure.

Another approach is to note that 6 and 10 can make even numbers, and 15 can add odd numbers. Let me check that. For example, 6 and 10 can make any even number starting from 6*2=12 (since 6+6=12, 10+6=16, etc.). But with 15, which is odd, adding 15 to an even number gives an odd number. So maybe any number greater than or equal to a certain point can be formed by combining these.

Alternatively, let's think of the problem as combining 6, 10, and 15. Since 6 and 15 are multiples of 3, and 10 is not. So numbers that are not multiples of 3 might be harder to form. Wait, but 10 is not a multiple of 3, so combining 10 with other coins can create numbers that aren't multiples of 3. For example, 10 +6=16, which isn't a multiple of 3. So perhaps the key is to check numbers that are not multiples of 3 and see if they can be formed with 10 and 6.

Wait, maybe I can separate the problem based on modulo 3. Let's see:

Numbers can be congruent to 0, 1, or 2 modulo 3.

For numbers congruent to 0 mod 3: They must be formed by 6 and 15. Since 6 is 0 mod 3 and 15 is 0 mod 3. So any multiple of 3 can be formed as long as it's at least 6 (since 6 is the smallest). Wait, but 3 itself can't be formed because 6 is the smallest, and 15 is 15. So 3 can't be formed. 6 can be formed (one 6). 9: Hmm, 9 can't be formed with 6 and 15? Let's check: 6 + 6 =12, which is above 9. 15 is too big. So 9 can't be formed. Similarly, 12 can be formed (two 6s). 15 is a single 15. So for numbers divisible by 3, starting from 6, but 3, 9 can't be formed. Wait, but 15 is 0 mod 3, so any multiple of 3 above 15 can be formed by adding 6s. For example, 15 +6=21, 15+12=27, etc. So the numbers divisible by 3 that can't be formed are 3, 9, and maybe 12? Wait, 12 can be formed as two 6s. So 3 and 9 can't be formed. So for numbers divisible by 3, the non-formable ones are 3 and 9.

Now for numbers not divisible by 3, which are 1 mod 3 or 2 mod 3. Let's see.

For numbers congruent to 1 mod 3: Let's see if they can be formed by 10 and 6. Since 10 is 1 mod 3 (10 mod 3 is 1), so adding 10s and 6s (which are 0 mod 3) can give numbers that are 1 mod 3. Similarly, for numbers congruent to 2 mod 3: 10 is 1 mod 3, so adding two 10s gives 2 mod 3 (10+10=20, which is 2 mod 3). So maybe for numbers congruent to 1 or 2 mod 3, they can be formed by combinations of 10 and 6.

But wait, let's check specific numbers. For example, 1 mod 3: Let's see if numbers like 1, 4, 7, 10, etc., can be formed.

1: Can't be formed. 4: Can't be formed. 7: Let's see. 7 - 10 is negative, so no. 7 can't be formed. 10 is a single 10. 10 is 1 mod 3. 13: 10 + 6=16, which is 1 mod 3? Wait, 10 is 1 mod 3, 6 is 0 mod 3, so 10 +6=16 is 1 mod 3. 13: Let's check if 13 can be formed. 13 -10=3, which can't be formed. 13-6=7, which can't be formed. So 13 can't be formed. 16 can be formed (10+6). 19: 19-10=9, which can't be formed. 19-6=13, which can't be formed. So 19 can't be formed. 22: 22-10=12, which can be formed (two 6s). So 10 +12=22. So 22 can be formed. So 22 is 1 mod 3. So maybe once we reach 22, all higher numbers in that residue can be formed by adding 6s. Let's check 25: 25-10=15, which is a 15. So 15+10=25. So 25 can be formed. So for 1 mod 3 numbers, once we get to 22, all higher numbers can be formed by adding 6s. So the non-formable 1 mod 3 numbers are up to 22. But let's confirm.

Wait, 10 is 1 mod 3. 10+6=16, which is 1 mod 3. 16+6=22, which is 1 mod 3. 22+6=28, etc. So starting from 16, 22, 28, etc., which are 1 mod 3. But 10 itself is 1 mod 3. So perhaps the non-formable numbers in 1 mod 3 are 1,4,7,10? Wait, no. Wait, 10 is a coin, so 10 can be formed. So maybe 1,4,7,13,19, etc., can't be formed. Let's check:

1: Can't be formed. 4: Can't be formed. 7: Can't be formed. 10: Can be formed. 13: Can't be formed. 16: Can be formed. 19: Can't be formed. 22: Can be formed. 25: Can be formed. So the non-formable numbers in 1 mod 3 are 1,4,7,13,19. Similarly, for 2 mod 3. Let's check those.

Numbers congruent to 2 mod 3: 2,5,8,11,14,17,20,23,...

Check if they can be formed.

2: Can't be formed. 5: Can't be formed. 8: Let's see. 8-10 is negative. 8-6=2, which can't be formed. So 8 can't be formed. 11: 11-10=1, which can't be formed. 11-6=5, which can't be formed. So 11 can't be formed. 14: 14-10=4, which can't be formed. 14-6=8, which can't be formed. So 14 can't be formed. 17: 17-10=7, which can't be formed. 17-6=11, which can't be formed. So 17 can't be formed. 20: 20-10=10, which can be formed. So 10+10=20. So 20 can be formed. 23: 23-10=13, which can't be formed. 23-6=17, which can't be formed. So 23 can't be formed. 26: 26-10=16, which can be formed (10+6). So 16+10=26. So 26 can be formed. 29: 29-10=19, which can't be formed. 29-6=23, which can't be formed. So 29 can't be formed. 32: 32-10=22, which can be formed. So 22+10=32. So 32 can be formed.

So for 2 mod 3 numbers, the non-formable ones are 2,5,8,11,14,17,23,29. So the non-formable numbers in 2 mod 3 are up to 29. So the largest non-formable number in 2 mod 3 is 29.

Similarly, for 1 mod 3 numbers, the largest non-formable number is 19. For 0 mod 3 numbers, the non-formable numbers are 3,9. So the largest non-formable number is 9. So the overall largest non-formable number would be the maximum of 3,9,19,29, which is 29. But wait, let me check if 29 is indeed the largest.

Wait, but maybe there are higher numbers beyond 29 that can't be formed. Let me check 30. 30 is 15+15. So 30 can be formed. 31: 31-15=16, which can be formed (10+6). So 15+16=31. So 31 can be formed. 32: As above, can be formed. 33: 15+18=15+6+6+6. So yes. 34: 15+19=15+10+6+6+6? Wait, 15+10=25, 25+6=31, 31+6=37. Wait, 34. Maybe 10+10+14. Wait, 14 can't be formed. Hmm, maybe 15+19=34. But 19 can't be formed. Alternatively, 6*5=30, 30+4=34. 4 can't be formed. Alternatively, 10+6*4=10+24=34. 24 is 6*4. So 10+24=34. So yes, 34 can be formed. So 34 is formed by 10 + 6*4. So 34 is formable. Then 35: 15+20=15+10+10. So 35 can be formed. 36: 15+21=15+6*3+6. So 36 can be formed. 37: 15+22=15+10+6*2. So yes. 38: 15+23=15+10+6*1+1. Wait, 1 can't be formed. Wait, 38-15=23, which can't be formed. 38-10=28, which can be formed (10+6*3=10+18=28). So 10+28=38. So 38 can be formed. 39: 15*2 +9=30+9. Wait, 9 can't be formed. Alternatively, 10*3 +6*1=30+6=36. 36+3=39. Wait, 3 can't be formed. Alternatively, 15+24=39. 24 is 6*4. So 15+24=39. Yes, so 39 can be formed. 40: 10*4=40. So 40 can be formed. 41: 10*3 +6*1=30+6=36. 36+5=41. 5 can't be formed. Alternatively, 15+26=15+10+6*2=15+10+12=37. 37+4=41. 4 can't be formed. Alternatively, 10*2 +6*4=20+24=44. Wait, that's too high. Alternatively, 15*2 +11. 11 can't be formed. Hmm, maybe 41 can be formed as 10 + 31. 31 can be formed as 15 +16. 16 is 10+6. So 10 +15 +10 +6=41. So yes, 41 can be formed. So 41 is formed. Then 42: 15*2 +12=30+12=42. 12 is 6*2. So yes. 43: 10 + 33=10 +15 +18=43. 18 is 6*3. So yes. 44: 10*2 +6*4=20 +24=44. So yes. 45: 15*3=45. So yes. So beyond 29, all numbers can be formed. Therefore, the largest non-formable number is 29.

But wait, let me check 29 again. 29. Let's try to express 29 as 15 +14. 14 can't be formed. 10 +19. 19 can't be formed. 6*4=24. 24 +5=29. 5 can't be formed. So no combination seems possible. So 29 can't be formed. Then, 30 can be formed, so 29 is the largest. But earlier, I thought 29 was in 2 mod 3. So according to my analysis, 29 is the largest non-formable number. Therefore, the answer should be 29. Then the sum of the digits is 2 +9=11.

But wait, let me check again if 29 is indeed the largest. Let's check numbers after 29:

30: 15*2=30.

31: 15 +16=15+10+6=31.

32: 10 +22=10+10+6*2=32.

33: 15 +18=15 +6*3=33.

34: 10 +24=10 +6*4=34.

35:15 +20=15 +10*2=35.

36:15 +21=15 +6*3 +6=36.

37:10 +27=10 +15 +6*2=37.

38:10 +28=10 +10 +6*3=38.

39:15 +24=15 +6*4=39.

40:10*4=40.

41:10 +31=10 +15 +16=10 +15 +10 +6=41.

42:15*2 +12=30 +6*2=42.

43:10 +33=10 +15 +18=43.

44:10*2 +6*4=20 +24=44.

45:15*3=45.

So yes, all numbers from 30 onwards can be formed. Therefore, 29 is the largest number that cannot be formed. Hence, the answer is 29, sum of digits is 2 +9=11.

But wait, I need to confirm once more. Let me check 29. Let's see all possible combinations:

29 divided by 15 is 1 with remainder 14. 14 can't be formed as 10 +6=16, which is too big. 29 divided by 10 is 2 with remainder 9. 9 can't be formed. 29 divided by 6 is 4 with remainder 5. 5 can't be formed. So no combination. So yes, 29 can't be formed. Then, since 30 can be formed, 29 is indeed the largest. So the answer is 29, sum of digits is 11.

But wait, I recall that sometimes when dealing with three coins, there might be a higher number that can't be formed. Let me check 29, 30, 31... All are covered. So I think it's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 11.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{11}
Therefore, the sum of the digits of \( x \) is \\(\boxed{11}\\).
