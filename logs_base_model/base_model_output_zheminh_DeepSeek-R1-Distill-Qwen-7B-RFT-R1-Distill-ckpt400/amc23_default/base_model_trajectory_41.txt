Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have four positive integers a, b, c, d. They multiply together to give 2^6 * 3^9 * 5^7. Also, we have a bunch of least common multiples (lcm) between different pairs. The question is asking for the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all four numbers. Hmm, right. Let me start by recalling some number theory concepts.

First, I remember that for any two numbers, the product of their gcd and lcm is equal to the product of the numbers themselves. So, gcd(a, b) * lcm(a, b) = a * b. Maybe this can help here. But since we have four numbers and lcm of every pair, this might get complicated. Let me see.

Given that abcd = 2^6 * 3^9 * 5^7, and all the lcm values given, perhaps we can analyze the exponents of each prime separately. Since gcd and lcm are multiplicative over prime factors, maybe we can handle each prime factor (2, 3, 5) independently. That is, find the exponents of 2, 3, and 5 in the gcd(a, b, c, d) by looking at their exponents in a, b, c, d.

Let me first consider the prime factors one by one. Let's start with prime 2.

For each prime p, the exponent of p in gcd(a, b, c, d) is the minimum exponent of p in a, b, c, d. Similarly, the exponent of p in lcm(a, b) is the maximum exponent of p in a and b. So, if I can figure out the exponents of 2 in a, b, c, d, then the minimum of those four will be the exponent in the gcd.

Same goes for primes 3 and 5. So, maybe we can handle each prime separately. Let's try that.

Starting with prime 2:

We know that abcd has exponent 6. So, the sum of exponents of 2 in a, b, c, d is 6.

From the lcm conditions:

lcm(a, b) has exponent 3 for prime 2. So, max(a_2, b_2) = 3.

Similarly, lcm(a, c) has exponent 3, so max(a_2, c_2) = 3.

Same for lcm(a, d): max(a_2, d_2) = 3.

Then, lcm(b, c) has exponent 1: max(b_2, c_2) = 1.

lcm(b, d) has exponent 2: max(b_2, d_2) = 2.

lcm(c, d) has exponent 2: max(c_2, d_2) = 2.

So, let's denote a_2, b_2, c_2, d_2 as the exponents of 2 in a, b, c, d respectively.

From the lcm(a, b) = 2^3, so a_2 or b_2 is 3. Similarly, lcm(a, c) = 2^3, so a_2 or c_2 is 3. Same for lcm(a, d) = 2^3, so a_2 or d_2 is 3.

But then, looking at lcm(b, c) = 2^1. So, both b_2 and c_2 are ≤1, and at least one of them is 1. But since lcm(a, b) = 2^3, which requires that a_2 or b_2 is 3. If b_2 is ≤1, then a_2 must be 3. Similarly, since lcm(a, c) = 2^3, and c_2 ≤1, then a_2 must be 3. Same with d_2: since lcm(a, d) = 2^3, and d_2 ≤1, then a_2 must be 3. So, a_2 = 3.

Therefore, a_2 = 3. Then, from lcm(a, b) = 2^3, since a_2 =3, max(3, b_2) =3, so b_2 can be anything up to 3. But lcm(b, c) =2^1, so max(b_2, c_2)=1. Since b_2 ≤1 (because max(b_2, c_2)=1), then b_2 ≤1. Similarly, from lcm(b, d)=2^2, max(b_2, d_2)=2. But since b_2 ≤1, d_2 must be 2. Wait, but lcm(c, d)=2^2, so max(c_2, d_2)=2. Since d_2=2, that's okay. But also, c_2 can be up to 2, but from lcm(b, c)=2^1, since b_2 ≤1, c_2 must be 1. Because max(b_2, c_2)=1. Since b_2 ≤1, c_2 must be 1. So, c_2=1.

So, summarizing:

a_2 =3

b_2 ≤1

c_2=1

d_2=2

Now, the sum of exponents is a_2 + b_2 + c_2 + d_2 = 3 + b_2 +1 +2 = 6. Therefore, 3 +1 +2 + b_2 =6 => b_2=0. Wait, that can't be. Wait, 3 + b_2 +1 +2 =6. So, 6 + b_2 =6 => b_2=0. But b_2=0? But b is a positive integer, so exponent 0 is allowed (since it's a factor of 1). Wait, but the problem says positive integers, so exponents can be 0, but the numbers themselves must be at least 1. So, if b_2=0, then b is not divisible by 2. But let's check.

But let's verify. If a_2=3, c_2=1, d_2=2, and b_2=0. Then sum is 3+0+1+2=6, which matches. Then, lcm(b, c) is max(0,1)=1, which is okay. lcm(b, d)=max(0,2)=2. lcm(c, d)=max(1,2)=2. So that's consistent. Also, lcm(a, b)=max(3,0)=3. lcm(a, c)=max(3,1)=3. lcm(a, d)=max(3,2)=3. So all the lcm conditions are satisfied. So, even though b_2=0, which would mean b is odd, that's okay. So, the exponents for prime 2 are:

a_2=3

b_2=0

c_2=1

d_2=2

Therefore, the minimum exponent among a, b, c, d for prime 2 is 0. So, the exponent in gcd(a,b,c,d) for prime 2 is 0. Therefore, 2^0=1 in the gcd. Wait, but the gcd is the product of primes raised to the minimum exponents. So, since prime 2 has minimum exponent 0, it's not included. So, gcd is product of primes with exponents >=1. So, next, let's check prime 3.

Moving on to prime 3:

Similarly, abcd has exponent 9. So, sum of exponents of 3 in a, b, c, d is 9.

From the lcm conditions:

lcm(a, b)=3^2. So, max(a_3, b_3)=2.

lcm(a, c)=3^3. So, max(a_3, c_3)=3.

lcm(a, d)=3^3. So, max(a_3, d_3)=3.

lcm(b, c)=3^3. So, max(b_3, c_3)=3.

lcm(b, d)=3^3. So, max(b_3, d_3)=3.

lcm(c, d)=3^3. So, max(c_3, d_3)=3.

So, let's denote a_3, b_3, c_3, d_3.

From lcm(a, b)=3^2: max(a_3, b_3)=2. So, both a_3 and b_3 are ≤2, and at least one of them is 2.

Similarly, lcm(a, c)=3^3: max(a_3, c_3)=3, so at least one of a_3 or c_3 is 3. But since a_3 ≤2 (from lcm(a, b)=3^2), then c_3 must be 3.

Similarly, lcm(a, d)=3^3: max(a_3, d_3)=3, so either a_3=3 or d_3=3. But a_3 ≤2, so d_3 must be 3.

Now, looking at lcm(b, c)=3^3: max(b_3, c_3)=3. Since c_3=3, this is satisfied regardless of b_3. Similarly, lcm(b, d)=3^3: max(b_3, d_3)=3. Since d_3=3, this is satisfied regardless of b_3. Same with lcm(c, d)=3^3: max(c_3, d_3)=3, which is satisfied.

Now, let's note that a_3 ≤2, c_3=3, d_3=3. So, sum of exponents: a_3 + b_3 +3 +3 =9. Therefore, a_3 + b_3 =3.

From lcm(a, b)=3^2: max(a_3, b_3)=2. So, both a_3 and b_3 are ≤2, and at least one is 2. Also, a_3 + b_3 =3. Let's find possible pairs:

Case 1: a_3=2, then b_3=1. Because 2 +1=3. Then, lcm(a, b)=max(2,1)=2, which is okay.

Case 2: a_3=1, then b_3=2. Similarly, lcm(a, b)=max(1,2)=2, which is okay.

Case 3: a_3=0, then b_3=3. But b_3 cannot be 3, since max(a_3, b_3)=2. So, this is invalid.

Similarly, a_3 cannot be 3, since a_3 ≤2. So, only cases 1 and 2 are possible.

Therefore, possible pairs:

Either (a_3=2, b_3=1) or (a_3=1, b_3=2).

So, moving forward, we have two possibilities for the exponents of 3.

Now, let's see if that affects the gcd. The gcd will have the minimum exponent among a_3, b_3, c_3, d_3. Since c_3=3 and d_3=3, the minimum is at least 3. Wait, but hold on. The minimum of a_3, b_3, 3, 3. So, if a_3 and b_3 are 2 and 1, the minimum is 1. But if a_3 and b_3 are 1 and 2, the minimum is still 1. Wait, but in both cases, the minimum exponent is 1. Because a_3 and b_3 are either 1 or 2. So, the minimum exponent across all four numbers is 1. Therefore, the exponent of 3 in gcd(a,b,c,d) is 1. Therefore, 3^1=3 is part of the gcd. Wait, but hold on. Let me verify again.

Wait, if a_3=2 and b_3=1, then the exponents are 2,1,3,3. So, min is 1. If a_3=1 and b_3=2, exponents are 1,2,3,3. Min is 1. So, either way, the exponent in gcd is 1. Therefore, 3^1 is in the gcd. So, moving on.

Now, prime 5:

Similarly, abcd has exponent 7. So, sum of exponents of 5 in a, b, c, d is 7.

From the lcm conditions:

lcm(a, b)=5^3. So, max(a_5, b_5)=3.

lcm(a, c)=5^3. So, max(a_5, c_5)=3.

lcm(a, d)=5^3. So, max(a_5, d_5)=3.

lcm(b, c)=5^2. So, max(b_5, c_5)=2.

lcm(b, d)=5^2. So, max(b_5, d_5)=2.

lcm(c, d)=5^2. So, max(c_5, d_5)=2.

So, let's denote a_5, b_5, c_5, d_5.

From lcm(a, b)=5^3: max(a_5, b_5)=3. So, at least one of a_5 or b_5 is 3.

Similarly, lcm(a, c)=5^3: max(a_5, c_5)=3. So, at least one of a_5 or c_5 is 3.

lcm(a, d)=5^3: max(a_5, d_5)=3. So, at least one of a_5 or d_5 is 3.

From lcm(b, c)=5^2: max(b_5, c_5)=2. So, b_5 and c_5 are ≤2, and at least one is 2.

Similarly, lcm(b, d)=5^2: max(b_5, d_5)=2. So, b_5 and d_5 are ≤2, and at least one is 2.

lcm(c, d)=5^2: max(c_5, d_5)=2. So, c_5 and d_5 are ≤2, and at least one is 2.

Now, let's analyze.

Firstly, since lcm(a, b)=5^3, and max(a_5, b_5)=3. But from lcm(b, c)=5^2, we know that b_5 ≤2. Similarly, from lcm(b, d)=5^2, d_5 ≤2. Therefore, a_5 must be 3 because b_5 ≤2. Similarly, from lcm(a, c)=5^3, since c_5 ≤2 (from lcm(b, c)=5^2, which requires c_5 ≤2), then a_5 must be 3. Similarly, from lcm(a, d)=5^3, since d_5 ≤2 (from lcm(b, d)=5^2), then a_5 must be 3.

So, a_5=3.

Then, from lcm(a, b)=5^3: since a_5=3, then b_5 can be anything up to 3, but from lcm(b, c)=5^2, b_5 ≤2. Therefore, b_5 ≤2. Similarly, from lcm(b, d)=5^2: d_5 ≤2.

Also, from lcm(b, c)=5^2: max(b_5, c_5)=2. Since b_5 ≤2 and c_5 ≤2 (from lcm(c, d)=5^2), then at least one of b_5 or c_5 is 2.

Similarly, lcm(b, d)=5^2: max(b_5, d_5)=2. So, at least one of b_5 or d_5 is 2.

lcm(c, d)=5^2: max(c_5, d_5)=2. So, at least one of c_5 or d_5 is 2.

Therefore, let's summarize:

a_5=3

b_5 ≤2

c_5 ≤2

d_5 ≤2

Sum of exponents: 3 + b_5 + c_5 + d_5 =7 => b_5 + c_5 + d_5=4

Also, from lcm(b, c)=5^2: max(b_5, c_5)=2

From lcm(b, d)=5^2: max(b_5, d_5)=2

From lcm(c, d)=5^2: max(c_5, d_5)=2

So, each pair among b, c, d must have at least one 2.

Therefore, among b, c, d, at least two of them must be 2. Because if only one of them is 2, then the other two would have exponents ≤1, but then lcm(c, d) would require at least one of c or d to be 2, but if only one is 2, then the other would need to be 2 as well to satisfy lcm(c, d)=5^2. Wait, let me think.

Wait, if lcm(c, d)=5^2, then max(c_5, d_5)=2. So, at least one of c_5 or d_5 is 2. Similarly, lcm(b, c)=5^2 requires at least one of b_5 or c_5 is 2, and lcm(b, d)=5^2 requires at least one of b_5 or d_5 is 2.

So, let's consider variables b_5, c_5, d_5.

Each pair (b, c), (b, d), (c, d) must have at least one 2. So, in the three variables, how many 2s do we need at minimum?

If all three are 2: then sum is 6, but we need sum 4. So, that's too much.

If two are 2, and one is 0: sum is 4, which is okay. Let's see.

Case 1: two are 2, one is 0.

But then, lcm(c, d)=5^2 requires that at least one of c or d is 2. So, if one is 0, the other must be 2. Similarly, if two are 2, then the third can be 0. Let's check.

Suppose b_5=2, c_5=2, d_5=0. Then sum is 2+2+0=4. Check lcm conditions:

lcm(b, c)=max(2,2)=2: okay.

lcm(b, d)=max(2,0)=2: okay.

lcm(c, d)=max(2,0)=2: okay.

Similarly, if b_5=2, c_5=0, d_5=2: sum 2+0+2=4. Then:

lcm(b, c)=max(2,0)=2: okay.

lcm(b, d)=max(2,2)=2: okay.

lcm(c, d)=max(0,2)=2: okay.

Similarly, if c_5=2, d_5=2, b_5=0: sum 0+2+2=4. Then:

lcm(b, c)=max(0,2)=2: okay.

lcm(b, d)=max(0,2)=2: okay.

lcm(c, d)=max(2,2)=2: okay.

So, these are valid cases.

Alternatively, could we have one 2 and two 1s? Let's check.

Suppose b_5=2, c_5=1, d_5=1. Then sum 2+1+1=4. Check lcm conditions:

lcm(b, c)=max(2,1)=2: okay.

lcm(b, d)=max(2,1)=2: okay.

lcm(c, d)=max(1,1)=1: which is less than 2. So, this violates the lcm(c, d)=5^2. Therefore, this case is invalid.

Similarly, if two variables are 1 and one is 2, but same issue. For example, b_5=1, c_5=2, d_5=1. Then, lcm(c, d)=max(2,1)=2: okay. But lcm(b, c)=max(1,2)=2: okay. lcm(b, d)=max(1,1)=1: which is invalid. So, no good.

Therefore, the only possible cases are when two of b_5, c_5, d_5 are 2 and the other is 0. So, possibilities:

1. b_5=2, c_5=2, d_5=0

2. b_5=2, c_5=0, d_5=2

3. b_5=0, c_5=2, d_5=2

Therefore, three possible distributions for b_5, c_5, d_5.

Now, the exponents for 5 in a, b, c, d are:

a_5=3

b_5=2 or 0

c_5=2 or 0

d_5=2 or 0

But in each case, two of b_5, c_5, d_5 are 2 and one is 0.

Therefore, the exponents for 5 in the numbers are:

Case 1: (3,2,2,0)

Case 2: (3,2,0,2)

Case 3: (3,0,2,2)

Therefore, in each case, the minimum exponent among a, b, c, d for prime 5 is 0, because in each case, one of the numbers has exponent 0. Therefore, the exponent of 5 in the gcd(a,b,c,d) is 0. Hence, 5^0=1 is not included in the gcd.

Therefore, combining all three primes:

gcd(a,b,c,d) has exponents:

2^0 * 3^1 *5^0 =3^1=3.

Therefore, the gcd is 3.

Wait, let me confirm once again.

For prime 2: min exponent is 0 (since one of the numbers has exponent 0)

For prime 3: min exponent is 1 (since all numbers have exponents ≥1, and the minimum is 1)

For prime 5: min exponent is 0 (since one of the numbers has exponent 0)

Therefore, gcd is 3^1=3. So, the answer should be 3.

But let me check if that's consistent with the lcm conditions.

Wait, for example, if a_5=3, and one of b_5, c_5, d_5 is 0, then the gcd would have 0 exponents for 5, which is correct.

Similarly, for prime 3, even if some numbers have higher exponents, the minimum is 1, so 3 is part of the gcd.

But let me check if that is indeed the case.

Alternatively, could there be a higher gcd? For example, if all numbers have exponent 1 for prime 3, but then the sum would be 1+1+1+1=4. But abcd has exponent 9, which is much higher. So, no, that's not possible. Wait, actually, the exponents for each prime are independent. So, the total exponents for each prime in abcd are 6,9,7 for 2,3,5.

But, for each prime, the exponents in the gcd are the minimum exponents in a, b, c, d. So, for prime 3, the minimum exponent is 1, so 3^1 is in the gcd. For prime 2, minimum exponent is 0, so not included. For prime 5, minimum exponent 0, so not included. Therefore, gcd is 3.

Therefore, the answer is 3.

But let me verify once again with the exponents.

For prime 2:

a_2=3

b_2=0

c_2=1

d_2=2

Minimum is 0, so 2^0=1 is not in gcd.

For prime 3:

Possible cases:

Either (2,1,3,3), (1,2,3,3), etc. Wait, no. Wait, in the exponent distributions, for prime 3, we had a_3=2 or 1, and the others. Wait, no. Wait, for prime 3, the exponents are:

Case 1: a_3=2, b_3=1, c_3=3, d_3=3

Case 2: a_3=1, b_3=2, c_3=3, d_3=3

Therefore, in both cases, the exponents are (2,1,3,3) or (1,2,3,3). Therefore, the minimum exponent is 1. So, 3^1 is in gcd.

For prime 5:

The exponents are (3,2,2,0), (3,2,0,2), (3,0,2,2). So, minimum exponent is 0, so 5^0=1 not included.

Therefore, the gcd is 3^1=3. So, the answer is 3.

Therefore, the final answer is 3.
