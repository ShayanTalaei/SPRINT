Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how many nonempty subsets B of the set {0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 12} satisfy the condition that the number of elements in B is equal to the least element of B. Hmm. Let me start by understanding the problem.

So, the set we're dealing with is {0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 12}. That's 13 elements in total. A subset B is nonempty, and its size (number of elements) must be equal to its least element. For example, if the least element is 4, then the subset B must have exactly 4 elements. The example given is {4, 6, 8, 11}, which has 4 elements and the least element is 4, so that works.

First, I need to consider all possible subsets B. But since the condition is about the size and the least element, maybe I can approach this by fixing the least element and then counting the number of subsets for each possible least element.

Let me think. The least element in B can be any element from 0 up to 12. However, since the size of B must equal the least element, the least element can't be greater than the maximum possible size of B. The maximum size of B is 13 (the entire set), but the least element can't be 13 because 13 isn't in the set. Wait, actually, the least element is one of the elements in the set, which are 0 through 12. So the least element can be from 0 to 12. However, if the least element is 0, then the size of B must be 0, but B is a nonempty subset. So there are no subsets with least element 0. Therefore, possible least elements start from 1 up to 12.

But wait, if the least element is 1, then the size of B must be 1. So that's easy: the number of subsets where the least element is 1 and the size is 1 is just 1, which is the subset {1}. But wait, the least element is 1, and the size is 1. That's correct. So for least element 1, there's exactly 1 subset.

Similarly, for least element 2, the subset must have size 2. So the least element is 2, and we need to choose 1 more element from the elements greater than 2. The elements greater than 2 in the original set are {3, 4, 5, ..., 12}, which is 10 elements. So the number of subsets here is C(10,1) = 10.

Wait, but hold on. The original set is {0,1,2,...,12}. If the least element is 2, then all elements in B must be ≥2, and the smallest is 2. So the elements after 2 are 3 to 12, which is 10 elements. So the number of subsets of size 2 where the least element is 2 is equal to the number of ways to choose 1 element from these 10, which is indeed C(10,1) = 10.

Similarly, for least element 3, the size must be 3, so we need to choose 2 more elements from the elements greater than 3. The elements greater than 3 are 4 to 12, which is 9 elements. So the number of subsets here is C(9,2) = 36.

Continuing this pattern, for a least element k, the number of subsets would be C((12 - k), (k - 1)). Wait, let me check.

Wait, if the least element is k, then the subset B must have size k. Since the least element is k, the other elements must be ≥k. But since the set is {0,1,2,...,12}, the elements greater than k are from k+1 to 12. The number of elements greater than k is 12 - k. So the number of elements we need to choose is k - 1 (since we already have the least element k, and we need to choose the remaining k - 1 elements from the elements greater than k). Therefore, the number of such subsets is C(12 - k, k - 1).

But wait, this formula C(12 - k, k - 1) is valid only if 12 - k ≥ k - 1. Otherwise, it's zero. So let's check for which k this is possible.

12 - k ≥ k - 1 ⇒ 12 + 1 ≥ k + k ⇒ 13 ≥ 2k ⇒ k ≤ 6.5. Since k is an integer from 1 to 12, this means k can be from 1 to 6. For k = 7, 12 - 7 = 5, and k - 1 = 6. Then 5 < 6, so C(5,6) is zero. Therefore, for k from 7 to 12, the number of subsets is zero. So the possible values of k are 1 to 6.

Therefore, the total number of subsets is the sum from k = 1 to 6 of C(12 - k, k - 1).

Let me compute each term:

For k = 1: C(12 - 1, 1 - 1) = C(11, 0) = 1

k = 2: C(10, 1) = 10

k = 3: C(9, 2) = 36

k = 4: C(8, 3) = 56

k = 5: C(7, 4) = 35

k = 6: C(6, 5) = 6

Adding these up: 1 + 10 = 11; 11 + 36 = 47; 47 + 56 = 103; 103 + 35 = 138; 138 + 6 = 144.

So the total number of subsets is 144. Wait, but let me verify this.

Wait, is that correct? Let's check each term again.

For k=1: C(11,0) = 1. Correct.

k=2: C(10,1) = 10. Correct.

k=3: C(9,2) = 36. Correct.

k=4: C(8,3) = 56. Correct.

k=5: C(7,4) = 35. Correct.

k=6: C(6,5) = 6. Correct.

Sum: 1 + 10 + 36 + 56 + 35 + 6 = Let's compute step by step:

1 + 10 = 11

11 + 36 = 47

47 + 56 = 103

103 + 35 = 138

138 + 6 = 144. Yeah, that's 144.

But wait, hold on. The original problem says "nonempty subsets B" of {0, 1, 2, ..., 12}. So including 0? Let me check if the problem allows subsets containing 0. The problem statement says "subsets B", and 0 is an element of the original set, so subsets can contain 0. But when we fix the least element as k, we have to make sure that 0 is not included. Wait, but in our earlier reasoning, we considered k starting from 1, so 0 is not included in any of these subsets. Therefore, all subsets counted are nonempty and their least element is from 1 to 6, with sizes 1 to 6 respectively. So 0 is not part of any of these subsets, so all counted subsets are indeed nonempty and satisfy the condition. So 144 is the correct answer.

But wait, let me think again. Suppose the subset B includes 0. Then the least element of B would be 0. But the problem requires that the number of elements in B is equal to the least element. If B includes 0, then the least element is 0, so the size of B must be 0. But B is nonempty, so that's impossible. Therefore, subsets containing 0 cannot satisfy the condition. Therefore, all subsets counted must not contain 0. Hence, the original set we were considering, when we fix the least element as k, is {k, k+1, ..., 12}, which doesn't include 0. Therefore, all subsets counted are indeed subsets of {1, 2, ..., 12}, which is correct.

Therefore, the total number is 144.

But let me check with an example. The example given is {4,6,8,11}, which has 4 elements, and the least element is 4. According to our calculation, for k=4, the number of subsets is C(8,3) = 56. So that example is one of those 56 subsets. So that seems correct.

Another example: For k=1, the only subset is {1}. For k=2, subsets like {2,3}, {2,4}, ..., {2,12}, etc. Each of these has size 2 and least element 2. The number of such subsets is 10, which matches C(10,1)=10. So that's correct.

Therefore, the answer is 144.

Wait, but hold on. Let me verify once more. The problem is about subsets of {0,1,2,...,12}. So the total number of elements is 13. The subsets counted are those where the size is equal to the least element. Since subsets must be nonempty, the least element can be 1 to 12, but as we saw, only up to 6 are possible because beyond that, the combination becomes impossible. So summing from k=1 to 6, each term being C(12 - k, k - 1), gives 1 + 10 + 36 + 56 + 35 + 6 = 144. That seems right.

Alternatively, maybe there's a combinatorial identity here. The terms 1, 10, 36, 56, 35, 6 are the numbers from the 6th row of Pascal's triangle, but shifted. Wait, let's see. The terms are similar to the Fibonacci sequence but not exactly. Alternatively, these numbers are the coefficients from the Fibonacci generating function. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, this could be related to the number of subsets with certain properties.

Alternatively, perhaps the total is 144, which is 12*12. Wait, 12*12=144. Hmm, interesting. But 12 is the maximum element. Not sure if that's relevant.

Alternatively, maybe the number of such subsets is equal to the sum_{k=1}^6 C(12 - k, k - 1), which is indeed 1 + 10 + 36 + 56 + 35 + 6 = 144. So that's the answer.

Therefore, I think the answer is 144. But let me check with another approach.

Suppose we model this problem as tiling or something else. Wait, perhaps we can consider each element from 1 to 12 as a position, and we need to place elements such that the first element is k, and then we have k-1 elements after it. Since the elements are in order, once we fix the first element as k, the remaining k-1 elements must be chosen from the elements after k. Which is exactly what we did before. So the number of subsets is C(12 - k, k - 1). Therefore, the same formula applies.

Alternatively, maybe generating functions can be used here. Let's think. For each possible least element k, the generating function would be x^{k} * (1 + x + x^2 + ...)^{12 - k}. Wait, but we need exactly k elements, so the coefficient of x^{k} in the generating function would be the number of subsets. Hmm, but maybe this is complicating.

Alternatively, the problem is equivalent to finding the number of subsets of the set {1, 2, ..., 12} where the size of the subset is equal to the minimum element. So that's the same as our original problem. So the answer is 144. Therefore, I think 144 is the correct answer.

But just to be thorough, let's check for k=6. For k=6, the number of subsets is C(12 - 6, 6 - 1) = C(6,5) = 6. So subsets of size 6 with least element 6. The elements must be 6 and five elements from 7 to 12. There are 6 elements from 7 to 12, so choosing 5 gives 6 subsets. Correct. For example, {6,7,8,9,10,11}, {6,7,8,9,10,12}, {6,7,8,9,11,12}, {6,7,8,10,11,12}, {6,7,9,10,11,12}, {6,8,9,10,11,12}. Yep, 6 subsets. So that's correct.

Therefore, all the terms check out. So the total is 144. So I think that's the answer. Therefore, the final answer is $\boxed{144}$.
