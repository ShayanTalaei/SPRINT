Okay, let me try to figure out this problem step by step. So, Mrs. Jones has four identical glasses and she fills the first three completely. The fourth one is only 1/3 full. She wants to pour some juice from the first three glasses into the fourth one so that all four glasses have the same amount. The question is asking what fraction of a glass she needs to pour from each of the first three into the fourth. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

First, let me visualize the situation. There are four glasses. The first three are full, so each has 1 glass of juice. The fourth is only 1/3 full. So initially, the total amount of juice is 3 full glasses plus 1/3 glass, which is 3 + 1/3 = 10/3 glasses total. Since there are four glasses, if we want each glass to have the same amount, we need to divide the total juice equally among the four glasses.

So, total juice is 10/3. Divided by 4, each glass should have (10/3) / 4 = 10/12 = 5/6 of a glass. So each glass should end up with 5/6 glass. 

Now, the fourth glass currently has 1/3. So the amount needed to reach 5/6 is 5/6 - 1/3. Let me compute that. 1/3 is equal to 2/6, so 5/6 - 2/6 = 3/6 = 1/2. Therefore, the fourth glass needs an additional 1/2 glass of juice.

This 1/2 glass must come from the first three glasses. Since she's pouring equally from each of the first three glasses into the fourth one, each of the first three will give up some amount x. So 3x = 1/2. Therefore, x = 1/2 divided by 3 = 1/6. 

Wait, so each of the first three glasses gives up 1/6 of a glass? Let me check that again.

Total needed for the fourth glass: 5/6 - 1/3 = 5/6 - 2/6 = 3/6 = 1/2. So total of 1/2 glass needed. Since this is being poured equally from each of the first three glasses, each gives up (1/2)/3 = 1/6. 

Yes, that makes sense. So each of the first three glasses pours 1/6 into the fourth. Then, after pouring, each of the first three will have 1 - 1/6 = 5/6 left, and the fourth will have 1/3 + 1/2 = 1/3 + 3/6 = 2/6 + 3/6 = 5/6. So all four glasses have 5/6, which is equal. 

Therefore, the fraction to pour from each of the first three is 1/6. So m is 1, n is 6. Then m + n is 7. 

But let me verify once more to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's compute the total juice after pouring. Each of the first three glasses has 1 - 1/6 = 5/6, so three of them give 3*(5/6) = 15/6 = 5/2. The fourth glass has 1/3 + 3*(1/6) = 1/3 + 1/2 = 2/6 + 3/6 = 5/6. So total is 5/2 + 5/6 = (15/6) + (5/6) = 20/6 = 10/3, which matches the original total. So that checks out. 

Therefore, the answer is 1/6, so m + n is 7.
Therefore, the fraction of a glass that Mrs. Jones must pour from each of the first three glasses into the fourth glass is $\boxed{\frac{1}{6}}$. Therefore, $m+n = 1 + 6 = \boxed{7}$.
