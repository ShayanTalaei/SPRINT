Okay, so I need to find the number of ordered pairs of positive real numbers (a, b) that satisfy the equation (1 + 2a)(2 + 2b)(2a + b) = 32ab. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem.

First, the equation has three factors on the left side: (1 + 2a), (2 + 2b), and (2a + b). Each of these is a linear expression in terms of a and b. The right side is 32ab, which is a product of a and b. Since we're dealing with positive real numbers, all terms are positive, so maybe I can use some inequality techniques here, like AM-GM inequality? Not sure yet, but let's see.

Let me write out the equation again for clarity:

(1 + 2a)(2 + 2b)(2a + b) = 32ab.

First, maybe I can simplify some terms. Let's look at each factor:

1 + 2a: That's straightforward.

2 + 2b: I can factor out a 2, so that becomes 2(1 + b).

2a + b: That's also straightforward.

So substituting back into the equation:

(1 + 2a) * 2(1 + b) * (2a + b) = 32ab.

So simplifying the left side:

2 * (1 + 2a)(1 + b)(2a + b) = 32ab.

Divide both sides by 2:

(1 + 2a)(1 + b)(2a + b) = 16ab.

Hmm, that's a bit simpler. Now, maybe I can make substitutions or set variables to simplify further. Let's see if I can set x = 2a and y = b. Then:

1 + x = 1 + 2a,

1 + y = 1 + b,

2a + b = x + y.

So substituting in terms of x and y, the equation becomes:

(1 + x)(1 + y)(x + y) = 16*(x/2)*y.

Simplify the right side:

16*(x/2)*y = 8xy.

So the equation now is:

(1 + x)(1 + y)(x + y) = 8xy.

Hmm, that might be a bit easier to handle. So now, variables x and y are positive real numbers as well, since a and b are positive. So x = 2a > 0, y = b > 0.

So now, the problem reduces to finding the number of ordered pairs (x, y) of positive real numbers satisfying (1 + x)(1 + y)(x + y) = 8xy.

Maybe this substitution helps. Let's see if we can apply AM-GM here. AM-GM is often useful when dealing with products and sums.

Looking at the left side: (1 + x)(1 + y)(x + y). Let's see if we can find a way to relate this to the right side 8xy.

Alternatively, maybe set u = x + y and v = xy. Then, (1 + x)(1 + y) = 1 + x + y + xy = 1 + u + v. So the left side becomes (1 + u + v)(u) = 8xy = 8v.

So the equation is:

u(1 + u + v) = 8v.

But u and v are related by the equation u^2 ≥ 4v (since for positive x and y, (x + y)^2 ≥ 4xy). So maybe we can use this inequality.

But perhaps this substitution complicates things. Let's think differently.

Alternatively, maybe try to set u = x + 1 and v = y + 1. Then, 1 + x = u, 1 + y = v. Then, the left side becomes u*v*( (u - 1) + (v - 1) ) = u*v*(u + v - 2). So the equation is:

u*v*(u + v - 2) = 8*(u - 1)*(v - 1).

Hmm, not sure if this helps. Let's check:

Left side: u*v*(u + v - 2)

Right side: 8*(u - 1)*(v - 1)

But since u = x + 1 and v = y + 1, which are greater than 1, since x and y are positive. Maybe this substitution is not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps try to assume that x and y are equal? Let's see if that's possible. Suppose x = y. Then, substitute into the equation:

(1 + x)^2*(2x) = 8x^2.

Simplify left side:

(1 + 2x + x^2)*2x = 2x + 4x^2 + 2x^3.

Set equal to 8x^2:

2x + 4x^2 + 2x^3 = 8x^2.

Bring all terms to one side:

2x^3 + 4x^2 + 2x - 8x^2 = 0.

Simplify:

2x^3 - 4x^2 + 2x = 0.

Factor out 2x:

2x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0.

So 2x(x - 1)^2 = 0.

Solutions are x = 0 or x = 1. But x is positive, so x = 1. Then y = x = 1. So one solution is x = y = 1, which corresponds to a = 1/2, b = 1. Let's check this in the original equation:

(1 + 2*(1/2)) = 2,

(2 + 2*1) = 4,

(2*(1/2) + 1) = 2.

Multiply them: 2*4*2 = 16. The right side is 32*(1/2)*1 = 16. So yes, that works. So that's one solution.

But are there other solutions where x ≠ y?

Hmm. Let's try another approach. Maybe take logarithms? But since we have products, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps use substitution variables to make the equation symmetric.

Alternatively, consider the substitution t = x + y. Then, but not sure.

Alternatively, maybe set t = x/y or y/x. Let's see.

Suppose we set t = x/y, so x = ty. Then, substitute into the equation:

(1 + ty)(1 + y)(ty + y) = 8*(ty)*y.

Simplify:

(1 + ty)(1 + y)(y(t + 1)) = 8 t y^2.

Multiply out the left side:

(1 + ty)(1 + y) * y(t + 1) = 8 t y^2.

First compute (1 + ty)(1 + y):

= 1*(1 + y) + ty*(1 + y)

= 1 + y + ty + ty^2

= 1 + y(1 + t) + ty^2.

Then multiply by y(t + 1):

= [1 + y(1 + t) + ty^2] * y(t + 1)

= y(t + 1) + y^2(t + 1)(1 + t) + ty^3(t + 1)

Wait, this seems messy. Maybe not the best approach.

Alternatively, perhaps using substitution variables. Let me think.

Wait, another idea: suppose we let u = 1 + x, v = 1 + y. Then, the left side is u*v*(x + y). But x = u - 1, y = v - 1. So x + y = u + v - 2.

So the equation becomes:

u*v*(u + v - 2) = 8*(u - 1)*(v - 1).

Hmm, same as before. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps factor the left side.

Wait, maybe try to use the AM-GM inequality on the terms. Let's see.

We have (1 + x)(1 + y)(x + y) = 8xy.

Let me see if I can apply AM-GM to each of the factors.

First, 1 + x ≥ 2√x (AM-GM on 1 and x). Similarly, 1 + y ≥ 2√y. And x + y ≥ 2√(xy). So multiplying these inequalities:

(1 + x)(1 + y)(x + y) ≥ 8√(xy). Therefore, 8√(xy) ≤ 8xy.

Divide both sides by 8: √(xy) ≤ xy.

Which implies that √(xy) ≤ xy. Since x and y are positive, we can divide both sides by √(xy) (which is positive), getting 1 ≤ √(xy). Therefore, √(xy) ≥ 1, so xy ≥ 1.

So equality holds when 1 + x = 2√x, 1 + y = 2√y, and x + y = 2√(xy). So equality in AM-GM requires that each pair is equal. So 1 = x and 1 = y. So x = 1, y = 1. Which is the solution we found earlier. So that suggests that (x, y) = (1, 1) is the only solution where equality holds. But in the original equation, we have (1 + x)(1 + y)(x + y) = 8xy. So equality is achieved only when x = y = 1. But could there be other solutions where the product is equal to 8xy even though the individual AM-GM inequalities are not equalities?

Wait, but from the AM-GM inequality, we have (1 + x)(1 + y)(x + y) ≥ 8√(xy). So 8√(xy) ≤ 8xy implies √(xy) ≤ xy, which as before gives xy ≥ 1. So the original equation is (1 + x)(1 + y)(x + y) = 8xy. So combining this with the inequality, we have equality when the left side is exactly 8xy. Which is only possible if the AM-GM inequalities used are tight. Wait, but we used three AM-GM inequalities here. The equality in the product would require equality in each of the individual AM-GMs. So that would require 1 = x, 1 = y, and x = y. So x = y = 1. Therefore, the only solution is x = y = 1. Hence, only one solution. But wait, that can't be, because when I plug in different numbers, maybe other solutions exist.

Wait, let's test another pair. Let me try x = 2, y = 2.

Left side: (1 + 2)(1 + 2)(2 + 2) = 3*3*4 = 36.

Right side: 8*2*2 = 32. So 36 ≠ 32. So that's not a solution.

How about x = 1, y = 2.

Left side: (1 + 1)(1 + 2)(1 + 2) = 2*3*3 = 18.

Right side: 8*1*2 = 16. Not equal.

x = 0.5, y = 1:

Left side: (1 + 0.5)(1 + 1)(0.5 + 1) = 1.5*2*1.5 = 4.5.

Right side: 8*0.5*1 = 4. Not equal.

x = 1, y = 0.5:

Same as above, left side 4.5, right side 4.

Hmm, not equal.

Wait, maybe x = 2, y = 0.5.

Left side: (1 + 2)(1 + 0.5)(2 + 0.5) = 3*1.5*2.5 = 11.25.

Right side: 8*2*0.5 = 8. Not equal.

Hmm, seems like maybe only x = y = 1 is the solution. But let's check another case.

Suppose x = 0. Let's see, but x must be positive, so x can't be zero. Similarly, y can't be zero.

Alternatively, maybe take x approaching infinity. Let x approach infinity, then left side: (1 + x)(1 + y)(x + y) ≈ x*(1 + y)*x = x^2*(1 + y). Right side: 8xy. So for the left side to equal the right side as x approaches infinity, we need x^2*(1 + y) ≈ 8xy. Which would require (1 + y) ≈ 8y/x. But as x approaches infinity, 8y/x approaches zero, so 1 + y ≈ 0, which is impossible since y is positive. Therefore, no solution as x approaches infinity.

Similarly, if y approaches infinity, left side is approximately x*y*(x + y) ≈ x*y*y = x y^2. Right side is 8xy. So x y^2 ≈ 8xy => y ≈ 8. But then, if y approaches infinity, that's not possible. So perhaps the only solution is x = y = 1.

But wait, maybe there's another solution where x ≠ y. Let's try solving the equation.

Given that (1 + x)(1 + y)(x + y) = 8xy.

Let me try to expand the left side:

First, expand (1 + x)(1 + y) = 1 + x + y + xy.

Then multiply by (x + y):

(1 + x + y + xy)(x + y) = (x + y) + (x + y)^2 + xy(x + y).

So expanding term by term:

(x + y) + (x^2 + 2xy + y^2) + (x^2 y + x y^2).

Combine like terms:

x + y + x^2 + 2xy + y^2 + x^2 y + x y^2.

So the left side is x + y + x^2 + 2xy + y^2 + x^2 y + x y^2.

Set this equal to 8xy:

x + y + x^2 + 2xy + y^2 + x^2 y + x y^2 = 8xy.

Bring all terms to left side:

x + y + x^2 + 2xy + y^2 + x^2 y + x y^2 - 8xy = 0.

Simplify:

x + y + x^2 + y^2 + x^2 y + x y^2 - 6xy = 0.

Hmm, this is a complicated equation. Maybe factor terms.

Let me group terms:

x^2 + x + y^2 + y + x^2 y + x y^2 - 6xy = 0.

Hmm, factor x terms:

x(x + 1) + y(y + 1) + xy(x + y) - 6xy = 0.

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, factor terms with x and y:

x^2(1 + y) + y^2(1 + x) + x + y - 6xy = 0.

Still complicated. Maybe try to factor:

Looking for symmetry, since the equation is symmetric in x and y if we swap x and y. Let's check:

Original equation after expansion: x + y + x^2 + y^2 + x^2 y + x y^2 - 6xy = 0.

If we swap x and y, we get y + x + y^2 + x^2 + y^2 x + x^2 y - 6yx = 0, which is the same as the original equation. So the equation is symmetric in x and y. Therefore, any solution (x, y) must have a corresponding solution (y, x). So if there is a solution where x ≠ y, then there's another solution with x and y swapped. But since the problem asks for ordered pairs, both (x, y) and (y, x) would count as different solutions unless x = y.

But from our earlier trials, when x = y, the only solution is x = y = 1. So maybe the only solution is x = y = 1. But let's check.

Suppose x = y. Then, substituting into the original equation:

(1 + x)^2*(2x) = 8x^2.

Which simplifies to:

2x*(1 + 2x + x^2) = 8x^2.

Divide both sides by x (since x > 0):

2*(1 + 2x + x^2) = 8x.

Expand:

2 + 4x + 2x^2 = 8x.

Bring all terms to left:

2x^2 + 4x + 2 - 8x = 0.

Simplify:

2x^2 - 4x + 2 = 0.

Divide by 2:

x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0.

Which factors as (x - 1)^2 = 0. So x = 1. Therefore, the only solution when x = y is x = y = 1.

But the problem is asking for ordered pairs. So even if there are other solutions where x ≠ y, we need to count them as different pairs. However, from the trial above, when x ≠ y, the equation doesn't hold. So maybe (1, 1) is the only solution.

But wait, let's check another example. Let me choose x = 2, and see if I can solve for y.

Set x = 2:

(1 + 2)(1 + y)(2 + y) = 8*2*y.

So 3*(1 + y)*(2 + y) = 16y.

Left side: 3*(1 + y)*(2 + y) = 3*(2 + 3y + y^2) = 6 + 9y + 3y^2.

Set equal to 16y:

6 + 9y + 3y^2 = 16y.

Bring all terms to left:

3y^2 + 9y + 6 - 16y = 0.

Simplify:

3y^2 - 7y + 6 = 0.

Quadratic equation: 3y^2 -7y +6=0.

Discriminant: 49 - 72 = -23 < 0. So no real solutions. Therefore, x = 2 has no solution.

Similarly, try x = 1/2.

x = 1/2:

(1 + 1/2)(1 + y)(1/2 + y) = 8*(1/2)*y.

So 3/2*(1 + y)*(1/2 + y) = 4y.

Left side: (3/2)*(1 + y)*(1/2 + y) = (3/2)*( (1)(1/2) + (1)(y) + y*(1/2) + y^2 ) = (3/2)*(1/2 + y + y/2 + y^2 ) = (3/2)*(1/2 + (3y)/2 + y^2 ) = (3/2)*( (y^2) + (3y)/2 + 1/2 ).

Multiply out:

3/2 * y^2 + 9/4 y + 3/4.

Set equal to 4y:

3/2 y^2 + 9/4 y + 3/4 = 4y.

Multiply all terms by 4 to eliminate denominators:

6y^2 + 9y + 3 = 16y.

Bring all terms to left:

6y^2 + 9y + 3 -16y = 0.

Simplify:

6y^2 -7y +3 =0.

Discriminant: 49 -72= -23 <0. Again, no real solutions. So x = 1/2 also gives no solution.

Hmm, so when x =1, we get y=1. When x=2 or x=1/2, no real solutions. Let's try x=3.

x=3:

(1 +3)(1 + y)(3 + y) =8*3*y.

So 4*(1 + y)*(3 + y) =24y.

Left side:4*(3 + y +3y + y^2)=4*(3 +4y + y^2)=12 +16y +4y^2.

Set equal to 24y:

12 +16y +4y^2=24y.

Bring all terms to left:

4y^2 +16y +12 -24y=0.

Simplify:

4y^2 -8y +12=0.

Divide by 4:

y^2 -2y +3=0.

Discriminant:4 -12=-8<0. No real solutions.

Hmm, seems like x=3 also gives no solution. Let's try x=4.

x=4:

(1 +4)(1 + y)(4 + y)=8*4*y.

5*(1 + y)*(4 + y)=32y.

Left side:5*(4 + y +4y + y^2)=5*(4 +5y + y^2)=20 +25y +5y^2.

Set equal to 32y:

20 +25y +5y^2=32y.

Bring all terms to left:

5y^2 +25y +20 -32y=0.

Simplify:

5y^2 -7y +20=0.

Discriminant:49 -400=-351<0. No solution.

Hmm, so x=4 also no solution. Let's try x=0. Let's see, but x>0, so x can't be zero.

Alternatively, maybe the equation only has one solution. But let's check if there's another approach. Let's consider the equation:

(1 + x)(1 + y)(x + y) =8xy.

Let me try to set u = x + y and v = xy. Then, we can write:

(1 + x)(1 + y) =1 + x + y + xy =1 + u + v.

So left side is (1 + u + v) * u.

So equation: u(1 + u + v) =8v.

But also, since u =x + y and v=xy, we know that for positive x and y, u^2 ≥4v. So u ≥2√v.

Hmm, so we have u(1 + u + v) =8v.

Let me write this as:

u + u^2 + uv =8v.

Rearrange:

u + u^2 =8v -uv.

Factor right side:

u + u^2 =v(8 -u).

So v = (u + u^2)/(8 -u).

But since v=xy, and since u =x + y, we can relate this to the AM-GM inequality. Also, we have the condition that u ≥2√v.

So substituting v from above into this inequality:

u ≥2√[(u + u^2)/(8 -u)].

Square both sides:

u^2 ≥4[(u + u^2)/(8 -u)].

Multiply both sides by (8 -u):

u^2(8 -u) ≥4(u + u^2).

Expand left side:

8u^2 -u^3 ≥4u +4u^2.

Bring all terms to left:

8u^2 -u^3 -4u -4u^2 ≥0.

Simplify:

(8u^2 -4u^2) + (-u^3 -4u) ≥0.

4u^2 -u^3 -4u ≥0.

Factor:

-u^3 +4u^2 -4u ≥0.

Multiply both sides by -1 (inequality sign reverses):

u^3 -4u^2 +4u ≤0.

Factor left side:

u(u^2 -4u +4) ≤0.

Which is u(u -2)^2 ≤0.

Since u =x + y >0, and (u -2)^2 ≥0, the product u(u -2)^2 is non-negative. Therefore, the inequality u(u -2)^2 ≤0 implies that u(u -2)^2 =0.

But u >0, so the only possibility is (u -2)^2 =0, which implies u=2.

Therefore, u=2.

So from earlier, v=(u +u^2)/(8 -u). Since u=2:

v=(2 +4)/(8 -2)=6/6=1.

So v=1. Therefore, xy=1.

Therefore, we have u=2, which is x + y=2, and v=1, which is xy=1. So solving these equations:

x + y =2,

xy =1.

So this is a system of equations. Let's solve for x and y.

From x + y =2, we have y=2 -x. Substitute into xy=1:

x(2 -x)=1.

2x -x^2=1.

Rearrange:

x^2 -2x +1=0.

Which factors as (x -1)^2=0. Therefore, x=1. Then y=2 -1=1.

Therefore, the only solution is x=1, y=1. Hence, the only ordered pair (x, y) is (1,1). Converting back to a and b, since x=2a and y=b:

x=1 => 2a=1 => a=1/2,

y=1 => b=1.

Therefore, the only ordered pair (a, b) is (1/2, 1). So there's only one solution.

Wait, but this seems conflicting with the earlier conclusion when we tried x=1, y=1. So according to this, there's only one solution. But let me check if all steps were correct.

We started by assuming u =x + y and v=xy. Then, we derived that u must be 2, leading to x + y=2 and xy=1. Solving gives x=1, y=1. So that seems correct.

Therefore, the only solution is (1/2,1). Hence, the number of ordered pairs is 1.

But let's check if there's a possibility of another solution when u=2, but maybe when u=2, but x and y are different?

But if u=2 and xy=1, then x and y are the roots of the equation t^2 -2t +1=0, which is (t-1)^2=0. So the roots are both 1. Hence, x=y=1. Therefore, only one solution.

Therefore, the answer is 1.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{1}
Therefore, there is exactly one ordered pair of positive real numbers $(a,b)$ that satisfies the equation, so the final answer is $\boxed{1}$.
