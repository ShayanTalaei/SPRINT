Okay, so I need to find the area of triangle ABC where the side lengths are in arithmetic progression, the smallest side is 6, and the triangle has an angle of 120 degrees. The answer should be in the form m√n, where m and n are positive integers with n square-free, and then find m + n. Alright, let's start breaking this down.

First, arithmetic progression means the sides are increasing by a common difference. Let's denote the sides. Since the smallest side is 6, let me call them 6, 6 + d, and 6 + 2d, where d is the common difference. So the sides are 6, 6 + d, 6 + 2d. Now, in a triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. So we need to make sure that 6 + (6 + d) > 6 + 2d. Let's check that: 12 + d > 6 + 2d → 12 - 6 > 2d - d → 6 > d. So d must be less than 6. That's a constraint.

Now, the triangle has an angle of 120 degrees. Let's recall that the Law of Cosines relates the sides of a triangle to one of its angles. The formula is c² = a² + b² - 2ab cos(C), where C is the angle opposite side c. Since we have a 120-degree angle, which is an obtuse angle, the side opposite to it must be the longest side because in a triangle, the largest side is opposite the largest angle. Since 6 + 2d is the longest side, the 120-degree angle must be opposite that side.

So applying the Law of Cosines here, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the sides as follows: let a = 6, b = 6 + d, c = 6 + 2d. The angle opposite side c is 120 degrees. Therefore, according to the Law of Cosines:

c² = a² + b² - 2ab cos(120°)

Substituting the values:

(6 + 2d)² = 6² + (6 + d)² - 2 * 6 * (6 + d) * cos(120°)

First, let's compute cos(120°). Since 120 degrees is in the second quadrant, cos(120°) = -1/2. So cos(120°) = -1/2. That's useful because it will make the equation positive when multiplied by -2.

Let me compute each term step by step.

Left side: (6 + 2d)² = 36 + 24d + 4d²

Right side: 6² + (6 + d)² - 2 * 6 * (6 + d) * (-1/2)

Compute 6²: 36

Compute (6 + d)²: 36 + 12d + d²

Compute the third term: -2 * 6 * (6 + d) * (-1/2). Let's simplify this term. The negative signs will cancel out. The 2 and the 1/2 will also cancel. So this term becomes 6*(6 + d). Let's check:

-2 * 6 * (6 + d) * (-1/2) = (-2) * (-1/2) * 6 * (6 + d) = (1) * 6 * (6 + d) = 6*(6 + d) = 36 + 6d

So putting it all together, the right side is 36 + (36 + 12d + d²) + (36 + 6d)

Wait, no. Wait. Wait, the right side is 6² + (6 + d)² minus 2ab cos(theta). But since cos(theta) is negative, the term becomes positive. So actually, the entire expression is 36 + (36 + 12d + d²) + 6*(6 + d). Let's compute that.

First, 36 (from 6²) + 36 + 12d + d² (from (6 + d)²) + 36 + 6d (from the third term). Let's add them up:

36 + 36 + 36 = 108

12d + 6d = 18d

d²

So the right side is d² + 18d + 108

Therefore, the equation we have is:

Left side: 4d² + 24d + 36

Right side: d² + 18d + 108

Bring all terms to the left side:

4d² + 24d + 36 - d² - 18d - 108 = 0

Simplify:

(4d² - d²) + (24d - 18d) + (36 - 108) = 0

3d² + 6d - 72 = 0

Divide both sides by 3 to simplify:

d² + 2d - 24 = 0

Now, solving this quadratic equation for d. Let's use the quadratic formula:

d = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 96)] / 2 = [-2 ± sqrt(100)] / 2 = [-2 ± 10]/2

So two solutions:

d = (-2 + 10)/2 = 8/2 = 4

d = (-2 - 10)/2 = -12/2 = -6

But d is a common difference in the arithmetic progression of side lengths. Since the sides are 6, 6 + d, 6 + 2d, all sides must be positive. So 6 + d > 0 and 6 + 2d > 0. Since d = 4, sides are 6, 10, 14. All positive. If d = -6, sides would be 6, 0, -6, which is invalid. So d = 4 is the only solution.

Therefore, the sides are 6, 10, and 14. Now, let's verify if this satisfies the triangle inequality. The sum of the two smaller sides: 6 + 10 = 16, which is greater than 14. Similarly, 6 + 14 = 20 > 10, and 10 + 14 = 24 > 6. So yes, it forms a valid triangle.

Now, we need to find the area of triangle ABC with sides 6, 10, 14 and an angle of 120 degrees. Alternatively, since we have two sides and the included angle, we can use the formula:

Area = (1/2)ab sin(theta)

Where a and b are the sides enclosing the angle theta. However, in this case, the angle of 120 degrees is opposite the longest side, which is 14. Wait, so which sides are enclosing the 120-degree angle? Let's recall that in a triangle, the angle opposite the longest side is the largest angle. So if the angle opposite side 14 is 120 degrees, then the other two angles must be acute. Therefore, the 120-degree angle is between the two smaller sides? Wait, no. Wait, actually, in a triangle, the largest angle is opposite the largest side. So if the angle opposite the largest side is 120 degrees, then the other two sides are smaller, and the angle between them is not 120 degrees. Wait, let me clarify.

Wait, the Law of Cosines was applied with the angle opposite the largest side, so the angle between the two smaller sides (6 and 10) is not 120 degrees. Wait, but actually, the Law of Cosines can be applied to any sides. Let me check.

Wait, in the Law of Cosines, when we have sides a, b, c, and angle C opposite side c, then c² = a² + b² - 2ab cos(C). So in this case, we had c = 14, a = 6, b = 10, angle C = 120 degrees. Therefore, angle C is between sides a and b. So the angle between sides 6 and 10 is 120 degrees. Therefore, the angle between sides 6 and 10 is 120 degrees. Therefore, the other two angles are between sides 6 & 14 and 10 & 14, both of which would be acute.

Therefore, if we can use the formula for area with two sides and included angle, which is (1/2)ab sin(theta), where a and b are the sides enclosing the angle theta. So in this case, a = 6, b = 10, theta = 120 degrees. Therefore, the area should be (1/2)*6*10*sin(120°). Let's compute that.

First, sin(120°) is sin(180° - 60°) = sin(60°) = √3/2. So:

Area = (1/2)*6*10*(√3/2) = (1/2)*60*(√3/2) = 30*(√3/2) = 15√3.

Wait, that seems straightforward. So the area is 15√3, so m = 15, n = 3, so m + n = 18. But let me verify this because sometimes there can be different interpretations.

Alternatively, since we have all three sides, we can use Heron's formula as a check. Let's compute the semi-perimeter first. The sides are 6, 10, 14. The perimeter is 6 + 10 + 14 = 30, so semi-perimeter s = 15.

Then, Heron's formula is sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)] = sqrt[15*(15 - 6)*(15 - 10)*(15 - 14)] = sqrt[15*9*5*1] = sqrt[15*45] = sqrt[675]. Simplify sqrt(675). 675 = 25*27 = 25*9*3 = 225*3. So sqrt(225*3) = 15√3. So same result. Therefore, the area is indeed 15√3, so m = 15, n = 3, so m + n = 18.

Wait, but before finalizing, let me make sure there's no alternative approach that might have been a mistake. Let's see.

Another way is to use coordinates. Let me place the triangle with the 120-degree angle at the origin. Let’s say point A is at (0, 0), and sides AB and AC have lengths 6 and 10 respectively, with angle 120 degrees between them. Then, point B can be at (6, 0), and point C can be at (10 cos 120°, 10 sin 120°). Let's compute the coordinates.

cos(120°) = -1/2, sin(120°) = √3/2. Therefore, point C is at (10*(-1/2), 10*(√3/2)) = (-5, 5√3). Then, the coordinates of the three points are A(0,0), B(6,0), C(-5,5√3). Then, the area can be computed using the shoelace formula.

Compute the area as 1/2 |sum of x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i|. Let's list the coordinates:

A: (0, 0)
B: (6, 0)
C: (-5, 5√3)
Back to A: (0, 0)

Compute the sum:

(0*0 - 6*0) + (6*5√3 - (-5)*0) + (-5*0 - 0*5√3)

Which is (0 - 0) + (30√3 - 0) + (0 - 0) = 30√3

Take absolute value and multiply by 1/2: (1/2)*|30√3| = 15√3. Same result. So that's another confirmation.

Alternatively, if I use vectors, the area is (1/2)|AB × AC|. Vector AB is (6, 0), vector AC is (-5, 5√3). The cross product in 2D is scalar magnitude |AB_x * AC_y - AB_y * AC_x| = |6*5√3 - 0*(-5)| = |30√3| = 30√3. Then, area is (1/2)*30√3 = 15√3. Again, same answer.

So all methods lead to 15√3. Therefore, the answer is 15 + 3 = 18. Wait, but let me check once more if the sides are indeed 6, 10, 14.

Wait, the sides are in arithmetic progression starting at 6. So the sides are 6, 6 + d, 6 + 2d. We found d = 4, so sides are 6, 10, 14. Let's confirm if the angle opposite the longest side (14) is 120 degrees.

Using Law of Cosines:

14² = 6² + 10² - 2*6*10*cos(120°)

Compute left side: 196

Right side: 36 + 100 - 120*(-1/2) = 136 + 60 = 196. Yes, that's correct.

So all the steps check out. Therefore, the area is indeed 15√3, so m + n is 18.

But just to be thorough, let's consider if there's another arithmetic progression with the 120-degree angle somewhere else. Wait, the problem states that the side lengths are in arithmetic progression and the triangle has an angle of 120 degrees. Since the side lengths are in arithmetic progression, the order matters. The smallest side is 6, so the sides are 6, 6 + d, 6 + 2d. Since the angle of 120 degrees is opposite the largest side, which is 6 + 2d, that's the only possible way. So there's no other configuration here. Therefore, the solution is unique, and we don't need to consider other cases.

Therefore, the answer is 18.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{18}
Therefore, the final answer is $\boxed{18}$.
