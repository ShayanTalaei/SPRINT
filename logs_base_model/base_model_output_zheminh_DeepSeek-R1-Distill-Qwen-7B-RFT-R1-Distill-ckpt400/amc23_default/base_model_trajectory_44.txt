Okay, let's see. The question is about Jackson's paintbrush. He can make a narrow strip that's 6.5 millimeters wide and he has enough paint for 25 meters long. We need to find out how many square centimeters of paper he can cover. Hmm, right. So first, I need to figure out the area he can paint. Area is usually length times width, but here we have two dimensions in different units. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the width of the strip is 6.5 millimeters. But the length is 25 meters. Since the question asks for square centimeters, I should convert all measurements to centimeters. Let's start with the width. Millimeters to centimeters. I remember that 1 centimeter is 10 millimeters. So, 6.5 millimeters divided by 10 should give the width in centimeters. Let me calculate that: 6.5 mm ÷ 10 = 0.65 cm. Okay, so the width is 0.65 centimeters.

Next, the length is 25 meters. I need to convert that to centimeters as well. There are 100 centimeters in a meter, right? So 25 meters times 100 centimeters per meter. Let me do that: 25 * 100 = 2500 centimeters. So the length is 2500 cm.

Now, the area would be the product of length and width. So area = 0.65 cm * 2500 cm. Let me multiply those numbers. 0.65 times 2500. Hmm, 0.65 * 2500. Let me think. 2500 divided by 10 is 250, so 0.65 is 65/100. So 65/100 * 2500. That's the same as (65 * 2500) / 100. Let's compute 65 * 2500 first. 65 * 2500. 2500 is 25 * 100, so 65 * 25 is 1625, then multiply by 100 gives 162,500. Then divide by 100: 162,500 / 100 = 1,625. So the area is 1,625 square centimeters.

Wait, let me check that again. 0.65 * 2500. Maybe another way. 2500 * 0.65. 2500 * 0.6 is 1,500, and 2500 * 0.05 is 125. So 1,500 + 125 = 1,625. Yep, same result. So that's correct.

So Jackson can cover 1,625 square centimeters of paper with the paint he has. I think that's the answer. Let me just make sure I converted all units correctly. The width was 6.5 mm to 0.65 cm, and length was 25 m to 2500 cm. Multiplying those gives cm * cm = cm², which is square centimeters. So the units check out. The calculation seems right. So I think that's the final answer.
