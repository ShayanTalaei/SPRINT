Okay, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. So, we have a 3-4-5 right triangle inscribed in circle A, and a 5-12-13 right triangle inscribed in circle B. We need to find the ratio of the area of circle A to the area of circle B and then express it as m/n where m and n are coprime, and finally find m + n. 

First, I remember that when a right triangle is inscribed in a circle, the hypotenuse of the triangle is the diameter of the circle. That's because the right angle subtends a semicircle, according to Thales' theorem. So, if we can find the hypotenuses of both triangles, those will be the diameters of their respective circles. Then, we can find the radii by dividing by 2, compute the areas, and then take the ratio.

Let me verify this with the first triangle. The 3-4-5 triangle. The hypotenuse is 5, so the diameter of circle A is 5. Therefore, the radius of circle A is 5/2. Then, the area of circle A would be π*(5/2)^2 = π*25/4.

Similarly, for the 5-12-13 triangle, the hypotenuse is 13. So, the diameter of circle B is 13, making the radius 13/2. The area of circle B is π*(13/2)^2 = π*169/4.

Now, the ratio of the areas of circle A to circle B is (25/4)/(169/4). The 4 in the denominators cancels out, so we get 25/169. 

Wait, but 25 and 169, are they coprime? Let's check. 25 factors are 5*5, and 169 is 13*13. There are no common factors, so yes, 25/169 is in simplest form. Therefore, m is 25 and n is 169, so m + n is 25 + 169 = 194.

But hold on, let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any mistakes here. Let's double-check each part.

First, confirming that in a right triangle inscribed in a circle, the hypotenuse is the diameter. Yes, that comes from Thales' theorem. So, the hypotenuse length is indeed the diameter. So, for the 3-4-5 triangle, hypotenuse 5 is the diameter, radius 2.5, area π*(2.5)^2. For the 5-12-13 triangle, hypotenuse 13 is the diameter, radius 6.5, area π*(6.5)^2. Then the ratio is (2.5)^2 / (6.5)^2, which is (25/4) / (169/4) = 25/169. Yep, that seems right.

Another way to think about it: the area ratio is (radius A / radius B)^2. Since radius A is 5/2 and radius B is 13/2, the ratio is (5/13)^2, which is 25/169. Same result. So that's consistent.

Therefore, the answer is 25/169, and 25 + 169 is 194. 

I think that's solid. No steps missing here. The key was remembering that the hypotenuse is the diameter for right triangles inscribed in circles. Then it's just calculating the areas and taking the ratio. All checks out.
