Okay, so I need to figure out the weight of a large pizza. The problem says that the weight of 1/3 of a pizza plus 3.5 cups of orange slices is the same as the weight of 3/4 of a pizza plus 0.5 cups of orange slices. Also, a cup of orange slices weighs 1/4 pound. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m - n.

First, let me parse the problem again to make sure I understand all the parts. So, there are two different combinations of pizza and orange slices that weigh the same. One combination is 1/3 pizza plus 3.5 cups of oranges, and the other is 3/4 pizza plus 0.5 cups of oranges. Since both combinations are equal in weight, I can set up an equation to solve for the weight of the pizza.

Let me assign variables to the unknowns. Let’s let P be the weight of a large pizza in pounds. The weight of the orange slices is given per cup, which is 1/4 pound. So, if we have a certain number of cups, we can multiply by 1/4 to get the total weight of the oranges.

The problem gives two scenarios:

1. 1/3 of a pizza plus 3.5 cups of oranges.
2. 3/4 of a pizza plus 0.5 cups of oranges.

Since their total weights are equal, we can write:

(1/3)P + 3.5*(1/4) = (3/4)P + 0.5*(1/4)

Now, I need to solve for P. Let me write that equation again:

(1/3)P + 3.5*(1/4) = (3/4)P + 0.5*(1/4)

First, let me compute the constants on both sides. Let's compute 3.5*(1/4) and 0.5*(1/4). 

3.5 is the same as 7/2, so 7/2 * 1/4 = 7/8. 

0.5 is 1/2, so 1/2 * 1/4 = 1/8.

So substituting these back into the equation:

(1/3)P + 7/8 = (3/4)P + 1/8

Now, let's get all the terms involving P on one side and constants on the other. Let's subtract (1/3)P from both sides:

7/8 = (3/4 - 1/3)P + 1/8

Now, compute 3/4 - 1/3. To subtract these fractions, find a common denominator. The denominators are 4 and 3, so the least common denominator is 12.

3/4 is 9/12, and 1/3 is 4/12. So 9/12 - 4/12 = 5/12.

So now the equation becomes:

7/8 = (5/12)P + 1/8

Next, subtract 1/8 from both sides to isolate the term with P:

7/8 - 1/8 = (5/12)P

6/8 = (5/12)P

Simplify 6/8 to 3/4:

3/4 = (5/12)P

Now, solve for P. Multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 5/12, which is 12/5:

P = (3/4) * (12/5)

Multiply the numerators and denominators:

3*12 = 36

4*5 = 20

So 36/20. Simplify this fraction. Both 36 and 20 are divisible by 4.

36 ÷ 4 = 9

20 ÷ 4 = 5

So P = 9/5 pounds.

Check if 9 and 5 are coprime. Yes, since 9 is 3^2 and 5 is prime, they share no common factors other than 1. So m = 9, n = 5. Then m - n = 9 - 5 = 4.

Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Starting with the equation:

(1/3)P + 3.5*(1/4) = (3/4)P + 0.5*(1/4)

Convert 3.5 to 7/2 and 0.5 to 1/2:

(1/3)P + (7/2)(1/4) = (3/4)P + (1/2)(1/4)

Compute the constants:

7/2 * 1/4 = 7/8

1/2 * 1/4 = 1/8

So equation becomes:

(1/3)P + 7/8 = (3/4)P + 1/8

Subtract (1/3)P:

7/8 = (3/4 - 1/3)P + 1/8

Convert 3/4 - 1/3 to 9/12 - 4/12 = 5/12

So:

7/8 = (5/12)P + 1/8

Subtract 1/8:

6/8 = (5/12)P

Simplify 6/8 to 3/4:

3/4 = (5/12)P

Multiply both sides by 12/5:

(3/4)(12/5) = P

Multiply numerator: 3*12 = 36

Multiply denominator: 4*5 = 20

36/20 reduces to 9/5. Yes, that's correct.

So P = 9/5 pounds. Therefore, m - n = 9 - 5 = 4.

Wait, but let me check another way. Suppose we plug P = 9/5 back into the original equation to verify.

Left side: (1/3)(9/5) + 3.5*(1/4)

Compute (1/3)(9/5) = 3/5

3.5 is 7/2, so 7/2 * 1/4 = 7/8

Total left side: 3/5 + 7/8. Let's compute this.

Convert to common denominator, which is 40.

3/5 = 24/40, 7/8 = 35/40. So 24/40 + 35/40 = 59/40.

Right side: (3/4)(9/5) + 0.5*(1/4)

Compute (3/4)(9/5) = 27/20

0.5 is 1/2, so 1/2 * 1/4 = 1/8

Convert 27/20 and 1/8 to common denominator 40.

27/20 = 54/40, 1/8 = 5/40. So total is 54/40 + 5/40 = 59/40.

Yes, both sides equal 59/40. So the solution is correct.

Therefore, the weight of a large pizza is 9/5 pounds, and m - n is 4.
So, the answer is $\boxed{4}$.
