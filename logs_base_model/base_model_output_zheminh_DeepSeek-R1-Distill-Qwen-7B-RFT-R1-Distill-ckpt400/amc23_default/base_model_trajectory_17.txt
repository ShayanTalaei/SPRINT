Okay, so I need to find the value of \( a_{2023} \) in the given tangent identity. The problem states that 

\[
\tan(2023x) = \frac{a_1 \tan x + a_3 \tan^3 x + a_5 \tan^5 x + \cdots + a_{2023} \tan^{2023} x}{1 + a_2 \tan^2 x + a_4 \tan^4 x + \cdots + a_{2022} \tan^{2022} x}
\]

whenever \( \tan(2023x) \) is defined. The goal is to determine \( a_{2023} \).

Hmm, I remember that multiple-angle identities for tangent can be expressed using polynomials. For example, \( \tan(3x) \) can be written as \( \frac{3\tan x - \tan^3 x}{1 - 3\tan^2 x} \). So, maybe there's a general pattern for \( \tan(nx) \) in terms of powers of \( \tan x \).

In general, \( \tan(nx) \) can be expanded using the tangent addition formula multiple times, but that gets complicated for large \( n \). However, I recall that the expansion involves Bernoulli numbers or something related to the Taylor series of tangent? Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, there's a formula involving sums of powers of \( \tan x \) with coefficients that are integers.

Wait, the problem already states that the expansion is in terms of odd powers of \( \tan x \) over even powers (starting with 1). So, maybe the coefficients \( a_k \) correspond to certain combinatorial numbers or known coefficients from the expansion.

Alternatively, maybe using complex numbers. Since \( \tan x = \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} \), and using Euler's formula, \( \tan(2023x) \) can be related to the imaginary part over the real part of \( e^{i2023x} \). But I'm not sure if that helps directly here.

Alternatively, using the expansion of \( \tan(nx) \) in terms of \( \tan x \). There's a formula for \( \tan(nx) \) as a continued fraction or using recursive relations. Wait, perhaps using De Moivre's formula combined with the expansion of sine and cosine?

Alternatively, maybe there's a generating function approach. If we consider the expansion of \( \tan(2023x) \) as a rational function in \( \tan x \), then the numerator and denominator would be polynomials in \( \tan x \). The problem states that the numerator is an odd polynomial (only odd powers) and the denominator is an even polynomial (starting with 1 and even powers).

I think that for \( \tan(nx) \), the expansion in terms of \( \tan x \) involves binomial coefficients or some combinatorial factor. Wait, actually, from the multiple-angle formula, the expansion for \( \tan(nx) \) can be written as a sum over certain combinations.

Wait, another approach: Using the identity for \( \tan(nx) \) in terms of \( \tan x \). For example, \( \tan(3x) = \frac{3\tan x - \tan^3 x}{1 - 3\tan^2 x} \), \( \tan(5x) = \frac{5\tan x - 10\tan^3 x + \tan^5 x}{1 - 10\tan^2 x + 5\tan^4 x} \), etc. Looking at these, I notice that the coefficients in the numerator and denominator seem to follow the pattern of binomial coefficients but with alternating signs and some scaling.

Wait, for \( \tan(3x) \), the numerator is \( 3\tan x - \tan^3 x \), which is similar to the coefficients of \( (1 + \tan x)^3 \) minus some terms. Let me check:

\( (1 + \tan x)^3 = 1 + 3\tan x + 3\tan^2 x + \tan^3 x \). So, if we subtract \( 2(1 + \tan^2 x) \), we get \( 1 + 3\tan x - 2 + -2\tan^2 x + \tan^3 x = -1 + 3\tan x - 2\tan^2 x + \tan^3 x \). That's not quite the same as the numerator. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe using the formula for \( \tan(n\theta) \) in terms of sums of products. Wait, another idea: The expansion of \( \tan(n\theta) \) can be written as the ratio of two polynomials in \( \tan \theta \), where the numerator is the sum over certain binomial coefficients with alternating signs, and the denominator is another sum with different signs.

Wait, perhaps the general formula is that:

\[
\tan(n\theta) = \frac{\sum_{k=0}^{m} (-1)^k \binom{n}{2k+1} \tan^{2k+1}\theta}{1 + \sum_{k=1}^{m} (-1)^k \binom{n}{2k} \tan^{2k}\theta}
\]

where \( m = \lfloor n/2 \rfloor \). Let me check this formula for \( n = 3 \):

Numerator: \( (-1)^0 \binom{3}{1} \tan \theta = 3 \tan \theta \)

Denominator: \( 1 + (-1)^1 \binom{3}{2} \tan^2 \theta = 1 - 3 \tan^2 \theta \)

Which gives \( \frac{3 \tan \theta}{1 - 3 \tan^2 \theta} \), which is correct for \( \tan(3\theta) \).

Similarly, for \( n = 5 \):

Numerator: \( \binom{5}{1} \tan \theta - \binom{5}{3} \tan^3 \theta + \binom{5}{5} \tan^5 \theta = 5 \tan \theta - 10 \tan^3 \theta + \tan^5 \theta \)

Denominator: \( 1 - \binom{5}{2} \tan^2 \theta + \binom{5}{4} \tan^4 \theta = 1 - 10 \tan^2 \theta + 5 \tan^4 \theta \)

Which matches the known expansion for \( \tan(5\theta) \). So it seems the general formula is:

\[
\tan(n\theta) = \frac{\sum_{k=0}^{\lfloor (n-1)/2 \rfloor} (-1)^k \binom{n}{2k+1} \tan^{2k+1}\theta}{1 + \sum_{k=1}^{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor} (-1)^k \binom{n}{2k} \tan^{2k}\theta}
\]

Therefore, in our problem, the coefficients \( a_{2k+1} \) in the numerator are \( (-1)^k \binom{2023}{2k+1} \), and the coefficients \( a_{2k} \) in the denominator are \( (-1)^k \binom{2023}{2k} \).

Therefore, the coefficient \( a_{2023} \) is the coefficient of \( \tan^{2023}\theta \) in the numerator. Since 2023 is odd, it's part of the numerator. Using the formula above, \( a_{2023} = (-1)^k \binom{2023}{2023} \), where \( 2k + 1 = 2023 \). Solving for \( k \), we get \( k = (2023 - 1)/2 = 1011 \).

Therefore, \( a_{2023} = (-1)^{1011} \times \binom{2023}{2023} = (-1)^{1011} \times 1 = -1 \).

Wait, but the problem states that the sequence is unique. Let me check if this makes sense. For \( n = 3 \), the coefficient of \( \tan^3 \) was \( -1 \), but in the example \( \tan(3x) = \frac{3\tan x - \tan^3 x}{1 - 3\tan^2 x} \), so the coefficient of \( \tan^3 \) was -1. So the formula gives \( a_3 = (-1)^1 \times 1 = -1 \), which is correct.

Similarly, for \( n = 5 \), the coefficient of \( \tan^5 \) is \( 1 \), since \( (-1)^2 \times 1 = 1 \). Let's check the expansion of \( \tan(5x) \): \( \frac{5\tan x - 10\tan^3 x + \tan^5 x}{1 - 10\tan^2 x + 5\tan^4 x} \). The coefficient of \( \tan^5 x \) is indeed 1, which matches \( (-1)^2 \times 1 = 1 \). So this seems to hold.

Therefore, for \( n = 2023 \), the coefficient \( a_{2023} = (-1)^{1011} \times 1 = -1 \), since 1011 is odd. Therefore, the answer should be \( -1 \).

But wait, hold on. Let me confirm this. The general formula for the numerator in the expansion of \( \tan(n\theta) \) is:

\[
\sum_{k=0}^{\lfloor (n-1)/2 \rfloor} (-1)^k \binom{n}{2k+1} \tan^{2k+1}\theta
\]

So, for \( n = 2023 \), the highest power is \( 2023 \), which corresponds to \( k = 1011 \), since \( 2k + 1 = 2023 \) gives \( k = 1011 \). Then, the coefficient is \( (-1)^{1011} \times \binom{2023}{2023} = (-1)^{1011} \times 1 = -1 \). Therefore, \( a_{2023} = -1 \).

But wait, is there a different convention or sign convention in the formula? Let's check with another value of \( n \). For \( n = 1 \), the expansion is \( \tan(\theta) = \frac{\tan \theta}{1} \). So numerator is \( \tan \theta \), which is \( (-1)^0 \binom{1}{1} \tan^1 \theta \). So the coefficient is \( (-1)^0 \times 1 = 1 \), which matches. For \( n = 7 \), the coefficient of \( \tan^7 \theta \) would be \( (-1)^3 \times 1 = -1 \). Let me check an expansion of \( \tan(7x) \). The expansion is:

\[
\tan(7x) = \frac{7\tan x - 35\tan^3 x + 21\tan^5 x - \tan^7 x}{1 - 21\tan^2 x + 35\tan^4 x - 7\tan^6 x}
\]

So the coefficient of \( \tan^7 x \) is -1, which matches the formula. So the formula seems consistent.

Therefore, for \( n = 2023 \), the coefficient of \( \tan^{2023}x \) in the numerator is indeed \( (-1)^{1011} = -1 \).

Therefore, the answer should be \( \boxed{-1} \).

But wait, let me check once more. Let me see if there's another approach. For example, using complex numbers. Let's recall that \( \tan(2023x) = \frac{\sin(2023x)}{\cos(2023x)} \). Using the identity for sine and cosine multiple angles in terms of tangent.

Alternatively, using the formula for \( \sin(nx) \) and \( \cos(nx) \) in terms of \( \sin x \) and \( \cos x \), and then dividing them to get \( \tan(nx) \). But that might get complicated.

Alternatively, considering that \( \tan(2023x) \) can be written as a continued fraction or using generating functions. But maybe that's overcomplicating.

Alternatively, consider the expansion of \( \tan x \) in terms of its Taylor series. Wait, but that's around 0, while here we have an identity valid for all \( x \) where the functions are defined. Hmm.

Alternatively, using the identity that \( \tan(nx) \) can be expressed as a rational function in \( \tan x \), and the coefficients correspond to the number of ways to arrange the terms. Wait, but I think the earlier approach using the general formula for the multiple-angle tangent is more straightforward.

Therefore, I think the answer is indeed \( -1 \). So the value of \( a_{2023} \) is \( -1 \).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{-1}
Therefore, the value of \( a_{2023} \) is \(\boxed{-1}\).
