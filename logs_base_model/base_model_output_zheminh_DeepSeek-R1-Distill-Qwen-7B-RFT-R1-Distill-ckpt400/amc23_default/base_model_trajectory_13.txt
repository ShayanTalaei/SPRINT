Okay, so I need to find the probability that d(Q, R) > d(R, S) where Q, R, S are distinct vertices of a regular icosahedron. The icosahedron has 12 vertices, 30 edges, and each vertex is connected to 5 others. The distance d(A, B) is the minimum number of edges you need to traverse to get from A to B. 

First, I should figure out the possible distances between any two vertices. In an icosahedron, the maximum distance between two vertices is 3. Let me confirm that. Since it's a regular icosahedron, it's highly symmetric, so the diameter (the greatest distance between any two vertices) should be 3. Let me think: starting from any vertex, you can reach 5 vertices in 1 step, then 10 vertices in 2 steps (since each of those 5 vertices connects to 5 new vertices, but some might overlap), and the remaining 1 vertex would be 3 steps away. Wait, 12 vertices total. Let's check:

- Distance 0: 1 vertex (itself)
- Distance 1: 5 vertices
- Distance 2: 5 vertices (since 12 - 1 - 5 = 6, but wait, if you have 5 vertices at distance 1, each of those connects to 4 new vertices (since they can't connect back to the original), so 5*4=20, but that's more than the total. Hmm, maybe my initial assumption is wrong.

Wait, maybe the number of vertices at each distance is different. Let me recall that in an icosahedron, the graph is distance-regular. The distance distribution is such that from any vertex:

- Distance 0: 1
- Distance 1: 5
- Distance 2: 5
- Distance 3: 1

Yes, that adds up to 12. So from any vertex, there are 5 vertices at distance 1, 5 at distance 2, and 1 at distance 3. So the possible distances between two vertices are 1, 2, or 3. That makes sense because the diameter is 3.

So for any two vertices, their distance is either 1, 2, or 3. Now, the problem is selecting three distinct vertices Q, R, S randomly and computing the probability that d(Q, R) > d(R, S). 

Since the icosahedron is regular, all vertices are symmetric. So the probability should be the same regardless of which vertex R is. Therefore, without loss of generality, we can fix R as a particular vertex, say the "north pole" vertex, and compute the probabilities based on that. Then, since all other vertices are symmetric, the probability should be the same.

So let's fix R as a specific vertex. Then Q and S are two distinct vertices chosen from the remaining 11. We need to compute the probability that d(Q, R) > d(S, R). Because of symmetry, the distribution of distances from R to Q and from R to S is the same. So the probability that d(Q, R) > d(S, R) should be equal to the probability that d(S, R) > d(Q, R). Therefore, the probability that d(Q, R) > d(R, S) is equal to the probability that d(R, S) > d(Q, R). 

But then, there's also the case where d(Q, R) = d(R, S). So the total probability space is divided into three parts: d(Q, R) > d(R, S), d(Q, R) < d(R, S), and d(Q, R) = d(R, S). Since the icosahedron is symmetric, the probability that d(Q, R) > d(R, S) is equal to the probability that d(Q, R) < d(R, S). Letâ€™s denote P(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)) = p, then P(d(Q, R) < d(R, S)) = p, and P(d(Q, R) = d(R, S)) = 1 - 2p. Therefore, the probability we need is p.

To find p, we can compute the number of pairs (Q, S) such that d(Q, R) > d(S, R), divided by the total number of pairs. Since Q and S are distinct, the total number of ordered pairs is 11 * 10 = 110. Wait, but since Q and S are distinct, the number of ordered pairs is 11 choices for Q and 10 for S, but since the problem states "distinct vertices", maybe we need to consider unordered pairs? Wait, no. The question says Q, R, S are distinct. So the total number of ordered triples is 12 * 11 * 10. But since we fixed R, the total number of ordered pairs (Q, S) is 11 * 10 = 110. But in the problem, Q, R, S are chosen as distinct vertices, so for each R, there are 11 choices for Q and 10 for S. However, since the problem is about the probability over all possible distinct triples, maybe we can fix R and compute the probability over Q and S.

Alternatively, since the icosahedron is symmetric, the probability is the same regardless of R. So we can fix R, compute the probability, and that's the answer.

So let's fix R. Then Q and S are distinct from R and each other. So the number of possible Q and S is 11 * 10. But since Q and S are ordered, that's 110. But the problem is about the probability that d(Q, R) > d(R, S). So we need to count the number of ordered pairs (Q, S) where d(Q, R) > d(S, R). Let's denote this count as N.

Then the probability is N / 110.

To compute N, we need to know, for each possible distance of Q from R, how many S have distance less than that. Since distances can be 1, 2, or 3.

First, let's note the number of vertices at each distance from R:

- Distance 1: 5
- Distance 2: 5
- Distance 3: 1

So from R, there are 5 vertices at distance 1, 5 at distance 2, and 1 at distance 3.

Now, for each possible distance of Q, we can compute how many S have distance less than Q's distance.

Case 1: Q is at distance 1 from R. Then d(Q, R) = 1. We need S to have d(S, R) < 1, which is impossible since the minimum distance is 1 (distance 0 is the vertex itself, but S must be distinct from R). So there are 0 such S.

Case 2: Q is at distance 2 from R. Then d(Q, R) = 2. We need S to have d(S, R) < 2, which means S must be at distance 1 from R. There are 5 such S.

Case 3: Q is at distance 3 from R. Then d(Q, R) = 3. We need S to have d(S, R) < 3. Since the maximum distance is 3, this means S must be at distance 1 or 2 from R. There are 5 + 5 = 10 such S.

Now, since Q is chosen uniformly from the 11 vertices (excluding R), and S is chosen uniformly from the remaining 10 (excluding R and Q), we need to compute the expected value over all Q and S.

But since the icosahedron is symmetric, the probability can be computed by considering the counts.

First, the number of Q at distance 1: 5. For each such Q, number of S with d(S, R) < 1: 0. So total for this case: 5 * 0 = 0.

Number of Q at distance 2: 5. For each such Q, number of S with d(S, R) < 2: 5. So total for this case: 5 * 5 = 25.

Number of Q at distance 3: 1. For each such Q, number of S with d(S, R) < 3: 5 + 5 = 10. So total for this case: 1 * 10 = 10.

Total N = 0 + 25 + 10 = 35.

But wait, the total number of ordered pairs (Q, S) is 11 * 10 = 110. So the probability is 35 / 110 = 7 / 22.

But hold on. Wait, but we have to make sure that S is distinct from Q as well. In the way we calculated N, we considered Q and S being distinct. Because when we count the number of S for each Q, they are distinct. So actually, in the calculation above, N is 35, which is the number of ordered pairs where Q and S are distinct and d(Q, R) > d(S, R). Then the probability is 35 / 110 = 7/22.

But let me verify this. Let's consider that when Q is at distance 3, there are 10 S's (distance 1 or 2). However, when Q is at distance 3, S can be any of the 10 vertices except Q, but since Q is at distance 3, and S is at distance 1 or 2, which are 10 vertices, and Q is one of them. Wait, but if Q is at distance 3, then S cannot be equal to Q, but since Q is unique (only one vertex at distance 3 from R), then when Q is at distance 3, all S's (which are 10 vertices at distance 1 or 2) are distinct from Q. So that's correct. So 1 * 10 = 10.

Similarly, when Q is at distance 2, there are 5 Q's, each with 5 S's at distance 1. All of these S's are distinct from Q because Q is at distance 2, and the vertices at distance 1 are separate. So 5 * 5 = 25.

And for Q at distance 1, 5 Q's, each with 0 S's. So total N is 35. So 35/110 = 7/22.

Therefore, the probability is 7/22. Then m + n = 7 + 22 = 29.

Wait, but before finalizing, let me verify once again. Let me check if there's another way to compute this.

Alternatively, since the icosahedron is symmetric, the probability should be the same regardless of R. So fix R, then Q and S are two distinct vertices from the remaining 11. The number of ordered pairs (Q, S) is 11 * 10 = 110. The number of favorable cases is when d(Q, R) > d(S, R).

As before, for each Q, depending on its distance from R, count the number of S's with distance less than Q's distance.

So:

- If Q is at distance 1 (5 Q's), then d(Q, R) = 1. There are 0 S's with d(S, R) < 1.

- If Q is at distance 2 (5 Q's), then d(Q, R) = 2. There are 5 S's with d(S, R) = 1.

- If Q is at distance 3 (1 Q), then d(Q, R) = 3. There are 10 S's with d(S, R) = 1 or 2.

So total favorable S's for each Q:

- 5 Q's * 0 = 0

- 5 Q's * 5 = 25

- 1 Q * 10 = 10

Total favorable ordered pairs: 25 + 10 = 35

Therefore, 35 / 110 = 7/22.

So the probability is 7/22, so m + n is 7 + 22 = 29.

But wait, let me confirm this with another approach. The total number of ordered pairs (Q, S) is 110. The number of unordered pairs is 55. But since we are dealing with ordered pairs, the answer is 35/110. 

Alternatively, since the problem is about ordered triples (Q, R, S), with Q, R, S distinct. The total number of such triples is 12 * 11 * 10. But since we can fix R, the probability is 35/110, as above.

Alternatively, considering that for each R, the number of ordered pairs (Q, S) is 11*10=110, and 35 of them satisfy d(Q, R) > d(S, R). Therefore, the probability is 35/110 = 7/22.

Therefore, the answer is 7/22, so m + n is 29.

But let me check if this makes sense. Since the distances are 1, 2, 3, and the number of vertices at each distance is 5, 5, 1 respectively. So when choosing Q and S, the possible combinations:

- Q at 1, S at 1: d(Q, R)=1, d(S, R)=1, so 1 not greater than 1. 5*5=25 pairs.

- Q at 1, S at 2: 1 < 2, so not favorable.

- Q at 1, S at 3: 1 < 3, not favorable.

- Q at 2, S at 1: 2 > 1, favorable. So 5*5=25.

- Q at 2, S at 2: 2 not greater than 2.

- Q at 2, S at 3: 2 < 3, not favorable.

- Q at 3, S at 1: 3 > 1, favorable. 1*5=5.

- Q at 3, S at 2: 3 > 2, favorable. 1*5=5.

- Q at 3, S at 3: 3 not greater than 3.

Wait, hold on. Wait, if I count this way:

Total number of ordered pairs (Q, S):

- Q at 1: 5 choices. For each, S can be 10 (excluding Q). The distances for S: 5 at 1, 5 at 2, 1 at 3, but excluding Q. If Q is at 1, then the S's at 1 are 4 (since Q is one of them), S's at 2: 5, S's at 3:1. So total S's: 4 + 5 + 1 = 10. But in terms of distances:

For Q at 1, the number of S with d(S, R) < 1: 0.

But in the above categorization, when Q is at 1, for S:

- S can be at 1 (4 others), 2 (5), 3 (1). So d(S, R) can be 1, 2, 3. So when Q is at 1, the number of S with d(S, R) < 1 is 0, which is correct.

When Q is at 2:

- S can be at 1 (5), 2 (4), 3 (1). So d(S, R) < 2 would be d(S, R)=1. So 5 S's.

When Q is at 3:

- S can be at 1 (5), 2 (5), 3 (0, since Q is at 3). So d(S, R) < 3 would be 5 + 5 = 10.

So total favorable pairs:

- Q at 2: 5 Q's * 5 S's = 25

- Q at 3: 1 Q * 10 S's = 10

Total 35.

But when I first thought about Q at 3, S at 1: 1*5=5, Q at 3, S at 2: 1*5=5. So total 10. So that's correct.

Therefore, 35/110=7/22 is correct.

Therefore, the answer is 7/22, so m + n = 7 + 22 = 29.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{29}
Therefore, the probability that $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$ is $\frac{7}{22}$, so the final answer is $\boxed{29}$.
