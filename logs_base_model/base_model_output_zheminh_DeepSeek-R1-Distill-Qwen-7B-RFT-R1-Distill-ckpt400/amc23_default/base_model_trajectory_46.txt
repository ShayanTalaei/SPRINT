Okay, let's see. The problem is about the polynomial P(x) which is given as the product of factors from (x-1) up to (x-10), each raised to the power of their respective coefficients. So, P(x) = (x-1)^1 (x-2)^2 (x-3)^3 ... (x-10)^10. Then, when the roots of this polynomial are removed from the number line, what remains is 11 disjoint open intervals. The question is asking on how many of these intervals P(x) is positive.

Hmm. So, first, I need to recall that when you remove the roots (which are at x=1, x=2, ..., x=10) from the number line, the number line is split into intervals between these roots. Since there are 10 roots, there are 11 intervals: (-∞, 1), (1,2), (2,3), ..., (9,10), (10, ∞). Each of these intervals is open, so they don't include the endpoints where the roots are.

Now, the question is about the sign of P(x) on each of these intervals. The polynomial changes sign at each root if the multiplicity of that root is odd. If the multiplicity is even, the polynomial does not change sign at that root. So, the sign of P(x) alternates between consecutive intervals if the root there has odd multiplicity, and remains the same if the root has even multiplicity.

Therefore, to determine on how many intervals P(x) is positive, I need to analyze the sign changes across each root. Starting from the leftmost interval (-∞, 1), we can determine the sign there and then track how each root affects the sign.

But first, let's check the sign of P(x) in the interval (-∞, 1). For x < 1, all factors (x - k) are negative since x is less than each k from 1 to 10. Each factor (x - k) is negative, and each is raised to a power equal to its coefficient. The sign of each (x - k)^m is (-1)^m because (negative)^m is negative if m is odd and positive if m is even.

Therefore, for x < 1, each factor (x - k)^m has a sign of (-1)^m. So, the total sign of P(x) is the product of all these individual signs. Since there are 10 factors, each contributing a sign of (-1)^m, the total sign is (-1)^{sum of m's}. The sum of m's is 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 10. Wait, let's compute that.

Sum from 1 to 10 is (10*11)/2 = 55. So, the total sign is (-1)^55. Since 55 is odd, (-1)^55 = -1. Therefore, P(x) is negative in the interval (-∞, 1).

Now, moving from left to right across the roots, we need to check at each root whether the multiplicity is odd or even. If it's odd, the sign of P(x) will flip; if it's even, the sign remains the same.

So, let's list the roots and their multiplicities:

x=1: multiplicity 1 (odd)
x=2: multiplicity 2 (even)
x=3: multiplicity 3 (odd)
x=4: multiplicity 4 (even)
x=5: multiplicity 5 (odd)
x=6: multiplicity 6 (even)
x=7: multiplicity 7 (odd)
x=8: multiplicity 8 (even)
x=9: multiplicity 9 (odd)
x=10: multiplicity 10 (even)

Starting from (-∞,1): negative.

At x=1: multiplicity 1 (odd), so sign flips. Now positive in (1,2).

At x=2: multiplicity 2 (even), sign remains positive. So, (2,3) is positive.

At x=3: multiplicity 3 (odd), sign flips to negative. So, (3,4) is negative.

At x=4: multiplicity 4 (even), sign remains negative. So, (4,5) is negative.

At x=5: multiplicity 5 (odd), sign flips to positive. So, (5,6) is positive.

At x=6: multiplicity 6 (even), sign remains positive. So, (6,7) is positive.

At x=7: multiplicity 7 (odd), sign flips to negative. So, (7,8) is negative.

At x=8: multiplicity 8 (even), sign remains negative. So, (8,9) is negative.

At x=9: multiplicity 9 (odd), sign flips to positive. So, (9,10) is positive.

At x=10: multiplicity 10 (even), sign remains positive. So, (10, ∞) is positive.

Now, let's list the intervals and their signs:

1. (-∞,1): Negative
2. (1,2): Positive
3. (2,3): Positive
4. (3,4): Negative
5. (4,5): Negative
6. (5,6): Positive
7. (6,7): Positive
8. (7,8): Negative
9. (8,9): Negative
10. (9,10): Positive
11. (10, ∞): Positive

Now, count how many intervals are positive. Let's go through each:

1. Negative
2. Positive (count 1)
3. Positive (count 2)
4. Negative
5. Negative
6. Positive (count 3)
7. Positive (count 4)
8. Negative
9. Negative
10. Positive (count 5)
11. Positive (count 6)

So, total of 6 intervals where P(x) is positive.

Wait, but let me double-check. Let's recount:

Intervals 2,3,6,7,10,11 are positive. That's six intervals. Yes.

But let me check if there's another way to compute this. Maybe by considering the number of sign changes.

Alternatively, since starting from the leftmost interval, which is negative, and each time the sign flips when passing through a root with odd multiplicity. The roots with odd multiplicities are x=1,3,5,7,9. That's 5 roots. So, starting from negative, after each odd root, the sign flips. So, starting negative, after x=1: positive; after x=3: negative; after x=5: positive; after x=7: negative; after x=9: positive. Then at x=10, which is even multiplicity, the sign remains positive.

So, the sign alternates between negative and positive at each odd root. So, the number of positive intervals would be: starting negative, then positive, negative, positive, negative, positive. Then after x=10, it remains positive.

Wait, so the sign alternates each time we pass an odd root. There are 5 odd roots (1,3,5,7,9). So, starting from negative, after each odd root, the sign flips. So:

From (-∞,1): Negative

After x=1 (odd): Positive

After x=3 (odd): Negative

After x=5 (odd): Positive

After x=7 (odd): Negative

After x=9 (odd): Positive

Then, after x=10 (even): sign remains Positive.

So, the intervals where the sign is positive are:

(1,2), (3,4)? Wait, no, wait. Wait, maybe I confused the intervals. Let me think.

Wait, the intervals are between the roots. So, each time we pass a root, the sign flips if the multiplicity is odd. So, starting from negative in (-∞,1):

Passing x=1 (odd): sign becomes positive. So, (1,2) is positive.

Passing x=2 (even): sign remains positive. So, (2,3) is positive.

Passing x=3 (odd): sign becomes negative. So, (3,4) is negative.

Passing x=4 (even): sign remains negative. So, (4,5) is negative.

Passing x=5 (odd): sign becomes positive. So, (5,6) is positive.

Passing x=6 (even): sign remains positive. So, (6,7) is positive.

Passing x=7 (odd): sign becomes negative. So, (7,8) is negative.

Passing x=8 (even): sign remains negative. So, (8,9) is negative.

Passing x=9 (odd): sign becomes positive. So, (9,10) is positive.

Passing x=10 (even): sign remains positive. So, (10, ∞) is positive.

So, the positive intervals are (1,2), (2,3), (5,6), (6,7), (9,10), (10, ∞). That's six intervals, as before.

Wait, but (2,3) is positive? Because between x=2 and x=3, the sign is positive. But according to the previous list, (2,3) is positive. So, that's correct. So, even though the root at x=2 has even multiplicity, the sign remains positive. So, the positive intervals are six in total.

But wait, another way to think about this: starting from the leftmost interval, which is negative, each time we cross an odd root, the sign flips. There are 5 odd roots (1,3,5,7,9). So, the sign alternates 5 times. Starting from negative, after 1 flip: positive, after 2 flips: negative, after 3 flips: positive, after 4 flips: negative, after 5 flips: positive. Then, after crossing x=10 (even), sign remains positive.

So, the sign in each interval is as follows:

1. (-∞,1): Negative

2. (1,2): Positive

3. (2,3): Positive (since x=2 is even, sign remains same as previous)

Wait, hold on. Wait, maybe my previous reasoning is conflicting here. Let's clarify.

Each time we pass a root, the sign flips if the multiplicity is odd. So, between (-∞,1): Negative.

Crossing x=1 (odd multiplicity): sign becomes Positive for (1,2).

Crossing x=2 (even multiplicity): sign remains Positive for (2,3).

Crossing x=3 (odd multiplicity): sign becomes Negative for (3,4).

Crossing x=4 (even): sign remains Negative for (4,5).

Crossing x=5 (odd): sign becomes Positive for (5,6).

Crossing x=6 (even): sign remains Positive for (6,7).

Crossing x=7 (odd): sign becomes Negative for (7,8).

Crossing x=8 (even): sign remains Negative for (8,9).

Crossing x=9 (odd): sign becomes Positive for (9,10).

Crossing x=10 (even): sign remains Positive for (10, ∞).

Therefore, the intervals (1,2), (2,3), (5,6), (6,7), (9,10), (10, ∞) are positive. So, six intervals.

Therefore, the answer should be 6.

But let me check once again. Let's take a test point in each interval and see the sign.

For (-∞,1): Let's take x=0. Then, each factor (x - k) is negative. So, (0-1)^1 = -1, (0-2)^2=4, (0-3)^3=-27, ..., (0-10)^10=10^10. So, the sign is (-1)^1 * (-1)^2 * (-1)^3 * ... * (-1)^10. The exponents are 1,2,3,...,10. So, the exponents mod 2: 1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0. So, the product of signs is (-1)^{1+0+1+0+1+0+1+0+1+0} = (-1)^5 = -1. So, negative. Correct.

In (1,2): Let's take x=1.5. Then, (1.5 - 1) = 0.5 (positive), (1.5 - 2) = -0.5 (negative), but raised to even power, so positive. Similarly, (1.5 - 3) = negative, raised to odd power, so negative. Let's compute the sign.

Each (x - k) for k=1: positive, k=2: negative^2=positive, k=3: negative^3=negative, k=4: negative^4=positive, etc.

So, signs: +, +, -, +, -, +, -, +, -, +, +.

Multiply all these: (+) * (+) * (-) * (+) * (-) * (+) * (-) * (+) * (-) * (+) * (+)

Count the number of negatives: positions 3,5,7,9: four negatives. So, (-1)^4 = +1. Therefore, positive. Correct.

Similarly, (2,3): x=2.5.

Factors: (2.5 -1)=1.5 (+), (2.5-2)=0.5 (+), (2.5 -3)= -0.5 (-), etc.

Signs: +, +, -, +, -, +, -, +, -, +, +.

Same as above: four negatives, so positive. Correct.

(3,4): x=3.5.

Factors: (3.5 -1)=2.5 (+), (3.5 -2)=1.5 (+), (3.5 -3)=0.5 (+), (3.5 -4)= -0.5 (-), etc.

Signs: +, +, +, -, +, -, +, -, +, -, +.

Count negatives: positions 4,6,8,10: four negatives. (-1)^4=+1. So, positive? Wait, but according to our previous analysis, (3,4) is negative. Wait, this contradicts.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, x=3.5 is in (3,4). So, factors:

(x-1)=2.5 (+), (x-2)=1.5 (+), (x-3)=0.5 (+), (x-4)= -0.5 (-), (x-5)= -1.5 (-), (x-6)= -2.5 (-), etc.

Wait, let's list all factors:

(x-1): +, since x=3.5>1

(x-2): +, since x=3.5>2

(x-3): +, since x=3.5>3

(x-4): -, since x=3.5<4

(x-5): -, since x=3.5<5

(x-6): -, since x=3.5<6

(x-7): -, since x=3.5<7

(x-8): -, since x=3.5<8

(x-9): -, since x=3.5<9

(x-10): -, since x=3.5<10

So, signs:

+, +, +, -, -, -, -, -, -, -.

So, three positive signs and seven negative signs.

So, total sign is (-1)^7 * product of the other signs. Wait, but each factor's sign is either positive or negative. The sign of the entire product is the product of all the individual signs.

So, the signs are: +, +, +, -, -, -, -, -, -, -.

Therefore, the product is (+)^3 * (-)^7 = (-1)^7 = -1. Therefore, P(x) is negative in (3,4). So, that's correct. So, my previous test point calculation was wrong because I miscounted the number of negative signs.

So, in (3,4), there are seven negative factors (from k=4 to k=10), so the product is negative. Therefore, (3,4) is negative. So, my initial analysis was correct. So, the positive intervals are indeed six.

Therefore, the final answer is 6.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{6}
Therefore, the number of intervals where \(P(x)\) is positive is \(\boxed{6}\).
