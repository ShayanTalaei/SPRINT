Okay, so I need to find the square of the magnitude of a complex number z, given that z⊗z equals z squared plus 40. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.

First, let's recall that a complex number z can be written as a + bi, where a and b are real numbers, and i is the imaginary unit. The magnitude squared of z, denoted |z|², is a² + b². That's straightforward.

The operation given here is u⊗v = ac + bdi, where u = a + bi and v = c + di. Wait, that seems a bit different from standard complex multiplication. Normally, complex multiplication is (a + bi)(c + di) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i. But this operation is defined as ac + bdi. Let me check that again. So u⊗v = ac + bdi. Hmm. Let me parse that. So if u = a + bi and v = c + di, then the real part of u⊗v is ac, and the imaginary part is bd multiplied by i. So it's like taking the real parts and multiplying them, and the imaginary parts multiplied together, but only the product of b and d times i. Interesting. So unlike standard multiplication, the imaginary parts here are being multiplied as bd and then multiplied by i, while the real parts are multiplied directly.

So, for z⊗z, since both u and v are z, which is a + bi, then z⊗z would be (a)(a) + (b)(b)i²? Wait, no. Wait, no, the definition is ac + bdi. So if u and v are both z = a + bi, then c = a and d = b. So substituting, z⊗z = a*a + b*b*i. So that's a² + b²i. Wait, is that right? Wait, hold on. Let me double-check.

Given u = a + bi and v = c + di, then u⊗v is defined as ac + (bd)i. So if both u and v are z = a + bi, then c = a and d = b. Therefore, z⊗z = a*a + (b*b)i, which is a² + b²i. Got it. So the result of the operation is a complex number with real part a² and imaginary part b².

On the other hand, z squared is (a + bi)². Let's compute that. Using standard complex multiplication: (a + bi)² = a² + 2abi + (bi)² = a² + 2abi - b². So that's (a² - b²) + 2abi. Therefore, z² is a complex number with real part (a² - b²) and imaginary part 2ab.

The problem states that z⊗z = z² + 40. So substituting the expressions we have:

Left side: z⊗z = a² + b²i

Right side: z² + 40 = (a² - b² + 40) + 2abi

Therefore, equating the real and imaginary parts:

Real part: a² = a² - b² + 40

Imaginary part: b² = 2ab

So we have two equations:

1. a² = a² - b² + 40

2. b² = 2ab

Let me simplify the first equation. Subtract a² from both sides:

0 = -b² + 40

Which implies that b² = 40.

So from equation 2: b² = 2ab. Since b² = 40, substitute that into equation 2:

40 = 2ab

Therefore, 2ab = 40 => ab = 20 => a = 20/b.

But b² = 40, so b = ±√40 = ±2√10.

Therefore, a = 20 / (±2√10) = ±10 / √10 = ±√10.

So a is either √10 or -√10, and b is either 2√10 or -2√10.

Therefore, the complex number z can be either √10 + 2√10 i or -√10 - 2√10 i, or the other way around? Wait, no. Let me check.

Wait, if b = 2√10, then a = 20 / (2√10) = 10 / √10 = √10. Similarly, if b = -2√10, then a = 20 / (-2√10) = -√10. So z is either √10 + 2√10 i or -√10 - 2√10 i.

Therefore, the magnitude squared |z|² is a² + b². For both cases, a² = (√10)² = 10, and b² = (2√10)² = 4*10 = 40. Therefore, |z|² = 10 + 40 = 50.

Wait, so regardless of the signs of a and b, the squares will be positive, so |z|² is 50. Therefore, the answer is 50.

But let me verify this step by step to ensure there are no mistakes.

First, let's verify the first equation:

From z⊗z = a² + b²i

z² + 40 = (a² - b² + 40) + 2abi

Setting real parts equal: a² = a² - b² + 40 => 0 = -b² + 40 => b² = 40. Correct.

Imaginary parts: b² = 2ab => 40 = 2ab => ab = 20. Correct.

Then solving for a and b:

b² = 40 => b = ±√40 = ±2√10

Then ab = 20 => a = 20 / b = 20 / (±2√10) = ±10 / √10 = ±√10. Correct.

Therefore, a = ±√10, b = ±2√10. So |z|² = (√10)^2 + (2√10)^2 = 10 + 40 = 50. Correct.

Therefore, the answer is 50.

But let me check if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by substituting z = a + bi into the given equation and solving for a and b.

Alternatively, since we have z⊗z = z² + 40, we can write:

z⊗z - z² = 40

Expressed in terms of a and b:

(a² + b²i) - [(a² - b²) + 2abi] = 40

Simplify the left side:

a² + b²i - a² + b² - 2abi = (b²) + (b² - 2ab)i = 40

But 40 is a real number, so the imaginary part must be zero. Therefore:

b² - 2ab = 0 => b² = 2ab, same as before.

And the real part:

b² = 40

Therefore, same equations as before. So |z|² = a² + b² = (from a = 20/b and b²=40) a² + 40. But since a = 20/b, a² = 400 / b² = 400 / 40 = 10. Therefore, |z|² = 10 + 40 = 50. Correct.

Therefore, the answer is 50. All steps check out.

**Final Answer**
The value of \( |z|^2 \) is \boxed{50}.
Therefore, the value of $|z|^2$ is $\boxed{50}$.
