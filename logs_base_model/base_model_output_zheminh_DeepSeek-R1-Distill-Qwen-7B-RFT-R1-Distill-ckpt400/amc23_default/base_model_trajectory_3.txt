Okay, let's see. I need to find the value of the series: 2³ - 1³ + 4³ - 3³ + 6³ - 5³ + ... + 18³ - 17³. Hmm, this looks like a pattern where each term is an even number cubed minus the preceding odd number cubed. Let me try to break it down.

First, let me check how many terms there are. The series starts with 2³ - 1³, then 4³ - 3³, and so on, up to 18³ - 17³. Since the even numbers go from 2 to 18, that's 9 terms (because 18 divided by 2 is 9). So there are 9 pairs here. Each pair is (2n)³ - (2n - 1)³, where n starts from 1 to 9. Wait, let me verify. For n=1: 2³ -1³, n=2:4³-3³,...n=9:18³-17³. Yes, that's correct. So there are 9 terms in total.

Now, maybe I can find a general formula for each pair and then sum them up. Let's consider a general pair: (2n)³ - (2n - 1)³. Let's expand this expression.

First, expand (2n)³: that's 8n³. Then expand (2n - 1)³. Using the binomial expansion, (a - b)³ = a³ - 3a²b + 3ab² - b³. So, (2n -1)³ = (2n)³ - 3*(2n)²*1 + 3*(2n)*1² -1³ = 8n³ - 12n² + 6n -1.

Therefore, the difference (2n)³ - (2n -1)³ is:

8n³ - [8n³ - 12n² + 6n -1] = 8n³ -8n³ +12n² -6n +1 = 12n² -6n +1.

So each pair simplifies to 12n² -6n +1. Therefore, the entire sum is the sum from n=1 to n=9 of (12n² -6n +1).

So now, I can compute this sum by breaking it into three separate sums:

Sum = 12*sum(n²) from 1 to 9 -6*sum(n) from 1 to9 + sum(1) from 1 to9.

I can use the formulas for these sums.

First, sum(n) from 1 to m is m(m+1)/2. For m=9, that's 9*10/2=45.

Sum(n²) from 1 to m is m(m+1)(2m+1)/6. For m=9, that's 9*10*19/6. Let's compute that: 9*10=90, 90*19=1710, 1710 divided by 6 is 285.

Sum(1) from 1 to9 is just 9*1=9.

So plugging these into the expression:

Sum = 12*285 -6*45 +9.

Calculate each term:

12*285: Let's compute 10*285=2850, 2*285=570, so total is 2850+570=3420.

6*45=270.

So Sum = 3420 -270 +9 = 3420 -270 is 3150, plus 9 is 3159.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, sum(n²) from 1 to9:

9*10*19/6 = (9*10*19)/6. 9/3=3, 10/2=5, so 3*5*19=15*19=285. Correct.

Sum(n) from 1 to9 is 45. Correct.

Sum(1) from 1 to9 is 9. Correct.

Then:

12*285: 10*285=2850, 2*285=570. 2850+570=3420. Correct.

6*45=270. Correct.

3420 -270=3150, 3150+9=3159. So the sum is 3159.

But wait, let me check if this is correct. Let's test with a smaller case. Suppose we have only the first two terms: 2³ -1³ +4³ -3³.

Compute manually: 8 -1 +64 -27 = 7 +37 =44.

Using the formula: sum from n=1 to2 of (12n² -6n +1) = [12*(1) -6*1 +1] + [12*(4) -6*2 +1] = (12 -6 +1) + (48 -12 +1) =7 +37=44. Correct. So formula works for n=2.

Similarly, test n=3: 2³-1³ +4³-3³ +6³-5³=8-1+64-27+216-125=7+37+91=135.

Using formula: sum from1 to3: 12*(1+4+9) -6*(1+2+3) +3*1=12*14 -6*6 +3=168 -36 +3=135. Correct. So formula works here too.

Therefore, the formula seems correct. So for n=9, the sum is 3159. Therefore, the answer should be 3159.

But let me just make sure that the original series is indeed 9 terms. The last term is 18³ -17³. Since each pair is even-odd, starting from 2-1, 4-3,...18-17. The even numbers go up to 18, which is 9 terms (2,4,6,...18). So 9 pairs. Correct. So the sum is 3159.

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to compute this. Let's think. The original series can be written as sum_{k=1}^{18} k³ - sum_{k=1}^{17} (2k -1)³. Wait, no. Wait, the original series alternates even and odd. Let's see:

The series is:

2³ -1³ +4³ -3³ +6³ -5³ +... +18³ -17³.

Group the terms as (2³ +4³ +6³ +...+18³) - (1³ +3³ +5³ +...+17³).

So the sum is (sum of even cubes from 2 to18) minus (sum of odd cubes from1 to17).

So perhaps compute each sum separately.

Sum of even cubes from2 to18. The even numbers are 2,4,...18. There are 9 terms. The sum is 2³ +4³ +...+18³. Each term is (2n)³ where n=1 to9. So sum is 8*(1³ +2³ +...+9³). Because (2n)³=8n³.

Sum of odd cubes from1 to17. The odd numbers are1,3,...17. There are9 terms (since 17=2*9 -1). The sum is 1³ +3³ +...+17³. Each term is (2n -1)³, n=1 to9.

So the original sum is 8*(sum n³ from1-9) - sum (2n -1)³ from1-9.

But we already computed sum (2n)³ - (2n -1)³ from1-9 as 3159. Alternatively, maybe compute each sum separately.

But let's compute sum of even cubes:

sum_{k=1}^{9} (2k)^3 =8*sum_{k=1}^9 k³. Sum of cubes from1 to9 is [9*10/2]^2=45²=2025. So 8*2025=16200.

Sum of odd cubes from1 to17: sum_{k=1}^9 (2k-1)^3. Let's compute this.

Alternatively, recall that the sum of cubes of first n odd numbers is [n(2n+1)]^2. Wait, is that correct? Wait, the sum of first n odd cubes: 1³ +3³ +5³ +...+(2n-1)³. The formula is n²(2n² -1). Let me check with n=1: 1=1²(2*1² -1)=1*(2-1)=1. Correct. For n=2:1+27=28. Formula:2²(2*4 -1)=4*(8-1)=4*7=28. Correct. So formula is sum_{k=1}^n (2k-1)^3 =n²(2n² -1).

Therefore, for n=9: sum is 9²*(2*81 -1)=81*(162 -1)=81*161. Compute 81*160=12960, plus 81=13041. So sum of odd cubes from1 to17 is13041.

Therefore, the original sum is even sum - odd sum=16200 -13041=3159. Same result as before. So that confirms it.

Therefore, the answer is 3159. So the value of the series is 3159. So I think that's correct.
Therefore, the value of the series is $\boxed{3159}$.
