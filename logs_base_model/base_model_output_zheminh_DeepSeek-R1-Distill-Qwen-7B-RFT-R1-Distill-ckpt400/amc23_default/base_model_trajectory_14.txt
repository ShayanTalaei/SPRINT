Okay, so I need to find the value of the function f at 2023, where f is defined such that the sum over all divisors d of n of d times f(n/d) equals 1 for every positive integer n. Hmm, this seems like a problem involving multiplicative functions and maybe Möbius inversion. Let me try to recall some number theory concepts.

First, the problem states that for all positive integers n, the sum over divisors d of n of d*f(n/d) is 1. That is, if I denote the sum as Σ_{d|n} d*f(n/d) = 1. I need to find f(2023). 

Since this is given for all n, maybe I can express f in terms of the Möbius function or some kind of inverse. The Möbius inversion formula usually deals with functions defined over divisors. Let me recall that if we have two arithmetic functions F and G such that F(n) = Σ_{d|n} G(d), then G(n) = Σ_{d|n} μ(d) F(n/d), where μ is the Möbius function. But in this case, the situation is a bit different because the sum is over d*f(n/d) multiplied by d. Let me try to manipulate the given equation.

Let me denote the given equation as:

Σ_{d|n} d * f(n/d) = 1 for all n.

Let me make a substitution. Let k = n/d, so that d = n/k. Then the sum becomes Σ_{k|n} (n/k) * f(k) = 1. So:

Σ_{k|n} (n/k) * f(k) = 1.

That's equivalent to:

n * Σ_{k|n} (1/k) * f(k) = 1.

Dividing both sides by n, we get:

Σ_{k|n} (1/k) * f(k) = 1/n.

So now we have:

Σ_{k|n} (1/k) * f(k) = 1/n for all n.

Hmm, this is interesting. Let me denote this as F(n) = 1/n, where F(n) is the sum over k|n of (1/k)*f(k). So, F(n) = Σ_{k|n} (1/k) * f(k) = 1/n. 

This seems like an equation where F(n) is expressed in terms of f(k) for divisors k of n. To solve for f(n), maybe we can use Möbius inversion here. The Möbius inversion formula says that if F(n) = Σ_{d|n} G(d), then G(n) = Σ_{d|n} μ(d) F(n/d). But in our case, the coefficients are different. Let me see.

Wait, in our case, F(n) = Σ_{k|n} (1/k) * f(k). Let me write this as:

F(n) = Σ_{k|n} (1/k) * f(k) = 1/n.

Let me denote G(k) = (1/k) * f(k). Then F(n) = Σ_{k|n} G(k) = 1/n.

Therefore, G(n) is the sum over k|n of G(k) = 1/n. So G is the function such that Σ_{d|n} G(d) = 1/n. Then by Möbius inversion, G(n) = Σ_{d|n} μ(d) * (1/n/d) = Σ_{d|n} μ(d) * d/n.

Wait, let me check that. If F(n) = Σ_{d|n} G(d), then G(n) = Σ_{d|n} μ(d) F(n/d). So substituting F(n/d) = 1/(n/d) = d/n.

Therefore, G(n) = Σ_{d|n} μ(d) * (d/n) = (1/n) Σ_{d|n} μ(d) d.

Therefore, G(n) = (1/n) Σ_{d|n} μ(d) d.

But G(k) = (1/k) f(k), so:

(1/k) f(k) = (1/k) Σ_{d|k} μ(d) d.

Therefore, f(k) = Σ_{d|k} μ(d) d.

Wait, so f(k) is equal to the sum over divisors d of k of μ(d) times d. That would mean f is the arithmetic function defined as the sum of μ(d) * d over all divisors d of k. 

Is that right? Let me verify with a small example. Let's take k=1. Then the divisors of 1 are just 1. So f(1) = μ(1)*1 = 1*1 = 1. Then check the original equation for n=1: Σ_{d|1} d*f(1/d) = 1*1 = 1, which matches the condition. Good.

For n=2, the divisors are 1 and 2. So Σ_{d|2} d*f(2/d) = 1*f(2) + 2*f(1) = f(2) + 2*1. According to the condition, this should equal 1. So f(2) + 2 = 1 => f(2) = -1.

Using our formula, f(2) = Σ_{d|2} μ(d) d. The divisors of 2 are 1 and 2. μ(1)=1, μ(2)=-1. So f(2) = 1*1 + (-1)*2 = 1 - 2 = -1. Correct.

Similarly, check n=3. The divisors are 1 and 3. Then Σ_{d|3} d*f(3/d) = 1*f(3) + 3*f(1) = f(3) + 3*1 = 1. So f(3) = 1 - 3 = -2.

Using the formula, f(3) = Σ_{d|3} μ(d) d. Divisors are 1,3. μ(1)=1, μ(3)=-1. So 1*1 + (-1)*3 = 1 - 3 = -2. Correct.

Another check: n=4. Divisors are 1,2,4. Then Σ_{d|4} d*f(4/d) = 1*f(4) + 2*f(2) + 4*f(1) = f(4) + 2*(-1) + 4*1 = f(4) - 2 + 4 = f(4) + 2. This should equal 1, so f(4) = 1 - 2 = -1.

Using the formula: f(4) = Σ_{d|4} μ(d) d. Divisors are 1,2,4. μ(1)=1, μ(2)=-1, μ(4)=0 (since 4 is divisible by 2^2). So 1*1 + (-1)*2 + 0*4 = 1 - 2 + 0 = -1. Correct.

So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, the function f(n) is given by f(n) = Σ_{d|n} μ(d) d. 

Therefore, to compute f(2023), we need to factorize 2023 first. Let me check if 2023 is a prime or composite. 

2023 divided by 7: 7*289=2023? 7*280=1960, 7*289=2023? Let's check 289*7: 289*7=2023. Wait, 289 is 17^2, so 17^2*7=2023. Therefore, 2023=7*17^2. Let me confirm that 7*17=119, 119*17=2023. 119*10=1190, 119*7=833, so 1190+833=2023. Correct. So 2023 factors into 7*17^2.

Therefore, the divisors of 2023 are 1, 7, 17, 17^2=289, 7*17=119, 7*289=2023. Wait, let me list them properly. The divisors are products of the prime factors. Since 2023=7^1*17^2, the exponents for 7 can be 0 or 1, and for 17 can be 0,1,2. So the divisors are:

- 7^0 *17^0=1

- 7^0 *17^1=17

- 7^0 *17^2=289

- 7^1 *17^0=7

- 7^1 *17^1=119

- 7^1 *17^2=2023

Therefore, the divisors of 2023 are 1,7,17,119,289,2023.

Now, we need to compute f(2023) = Σ_{d|2023} μ(d) * d.

So let's compute μ(d) for each divisor d:

1. d=1: μ(1)=1

2. d=7: 7 is prime, so μ(7)=-1

3. d=17: 17 is prime, μ(17)=-1

4. d=119=7*17: square-free, two distinct primes, μ(119)=1

5. d=289=17^2: not square-free (since 17^2 divides it), μ(289)=0

6. d=2023=7*17^2: also not square-free (17^2 divides it), μ(2023)=0

Therefore, the terms in the sum are:

- For d=1: μ(1)*1 = 1*1=1

- d=7: μ(7)*7 = (-1)*7 = -7

- d=17: μ(17)*17 = (-1)*17 = -17

- d=119: μ(119)*119 = 1*119 = 119

- d=289: μ(289)*289 = 0*289=0

- d=2023: μ(2023)*2023 = 0*2023=0

Therefore, summing these up: 1 -7 -17 +119 +0 +0 = 1 -7= -6; -6 -17= -23; -23 +119=96.

So f(2023)=96.

Wait, let me check the arithmetic again:

1 (from d=1)

-7 (from d=7) → total: -6

-17 (from d=17) → total: -6 -17 = -23

+119 (from d=119) → total: -23 +119 = 96

Yes, that's correct. The other divisors (289 and 2023) contribute 0, so they don't affect the sum. Therefore, f(2023)=96.

But wait, let me verify this with the original definition. Let's test the original condition for n=2023. The sum over d|2023 of d*f(2023/d) should be equal to 1.

Given that f(2023)=96, let's compute the sum:

For each divisor d of 2023, compute d * f(2023/d) and sum them up.

Divisors of 2023 are 1,7,17,119,289,2023.

Compute each term:

1. d=1: 1 * f(2023/1) = 1 * f(2023) = 1 *96=96

2. d=7:7 * f(2023/7)=7 * f(289). Wait, f(289)=?

Wait, f(n) for n=289. Let's compute f(289) using the formula f(n)=Σ_{d|n} μ(d)*d.

n=289=17^2. Divisors are 1,17,289.

Compute μ(1)*1 + μ(17)*17 + μ(289)*289.

μ(1)=1, μ(17)=-1, μ(289)=0. So f(289)=1*1 + (-1)*17 +0=1-17=-16.

Therefore, term for d=7:7*(-16)= -112

3. d=17:17 * f(2023/17)=17 * f(119). Compute f(119).

n=119=7*17. Divisors are 1,7,17,119.

μ(1)=1, μ(7)=-1, μ(17)=-1, μ(119)=1.

Thus, f(119)=1*1 + (-1)*7 + (-1)*17 +1*119=1 -7 -17 +119= (1-7)= -6; (-6 -17)= -23; (-23 +119)=96. So f(119)=96.

Thus, term for d=17:17*96=1632

4. d=119:119 * f(2023/119)=119 * f(17). Compute f(17).

n=17, prime. Divisors are 1,17.

f(17)=μ(1)*1 + μ(17)*17=1*1 + (-1)*17=1 -17=-16.

Thus, term for d=119:119*(-16)= -1904

5. d=289:289 * f(2023/289)=289 * f(7). Compute f(7).

n=7, prime. Divisors are 1,7.

f(7)=μ(1)*1 + μ(7)*7=1*1 + (-1)*7=1 -7=-6.

Thus, term for d=289:289*(-6)= -1734

6. d=2023:2023 * f(2023/2023)=2023 * f(1). f(1)=1, so term is 2023*1=2023

Now sum all terms:

96 (from d=1)

-112 (from d=7) → total: 96 -112 = -16

+1632 (from d=17) → total: -16 +1632 = 1616

-1904 (from d=119) → 1616 -1904 = -288

-1734 (from d=289) → -288 -1734 = -2022

+2023 (from d=2023) → -2022 +2023 =1

Which matches the condition. So yes, the sum is indeed 1. Therefore, f(2023)=96 is correct.

Therefore, the final answer is 96.
Thus, the value of \( f(2023) \) is \boxed{96}.
