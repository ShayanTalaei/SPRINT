Okay, let's see. The problem is asking for how many integers n the given expression is a real number. The expression is a square root, so the inside of the square root needs to be non-negative. Also, the denominator can't be zero because division by zero is undefined. So, first, I need to figure out the conditions under which the fraction inside the square root is non-negative and the denominator isn't zero.

Let me write down the expression again to make sure I have it right:

√[(log(n²) - (log n)²) / (log n - 3)]

First, let's simplify the numerator. The numerator is log(n²) minus (log n) squared. Remember that log(n²) is equal to 2 log n because of logarithm properties. So substituting that in:

Numerator: 2 log n - (log n)²

Denominator: log n - 3

So the expression becomes:

√[ (2 log n - (log n)²) / (log n - 3) ]

Since the square root requires the entire fraction to be greater than or equal to zero, we need:

[ (2 log n - (log n)²) / (log n - 3) ] ≥ 0

Additionally, the denominator log n - 3 cannot be zero, so log n ≠ 3, which means n ≠ 10³ = 1000. So n can't be 1000.

Also, since we have a logarithm, n must be positive. So n > 0. But since n is an integer, n ≥ 1.

So first, let's set log n = x. Then the inequality becomes:

(2x - x²) / (x - 3) ≥ 0

We can solve this inequality for x and then translate back to n.

Let me rewrite the inequality:

( -x² + 2x ) / (x - 3) ≥ 0

Factor the numerator:

- x² + 2x = -x(x - 2) = -x(x - 2)

So the inequality is:

[ -x(x - 2) ] / (x - 3) ≥ 0

Let me factor out the negative sign:

= [ -x(x - 2) ] / (x - 3) ≥ 0

Alternatively, multiply numerator and denominator by -1, which reverses the inequality:

x(x - 2) / (x - 3) ≤ 0

So the inequality becomes:

x(x - 2) / (x - 3) ≤ 0

Now, let's find the critical points where the expression is zero or undefined. The zeros are at x = 0, x = 2, and the denominator is zero at x = 3. So these critical points divide the real line into intervals. We can test each interval to see the sign of the expression.

Intervals:

1. x < 0
2. 0 < x < 2
3. 2 < x < 3
4. x > 3

Let's pick test points in each interval:

1. x = -1: plug into [x(x - 2)] / (x - 3)

Numerator: (-1)(-1 - 2) = (-1)(-3) = 3 (positive)

Denominator: (-1 - 3) = -4 (negative)

So overall: 3 / (-4) = -0.75 < 0

2. x = 1: numerator (1)(1 - 2) = (1)(-1) = -1 (negative)

Denominator (1 - 3) = -2 (negative)

Overall: (-1)/(-2) = 0.5 > 0

3. x = 2.5: numerator (2.5)(2.5 - 2) = (2.5)(0.5) = 1.25 (positive)

Denominator (2.5 - 3) = -0.5 (negative)

Overall: 1.25 / (-0.5) = -2.5 < 0

4. x = 4: numerator (4)(4 - 2) = 4*2 = 8 (positive)

Denominator (4 - 3) = 1 (positive)

Overall: 8 / 1 = 8 > 0

So the expression is:

- Negative when x < 0

- Positive when 0 < x < 2

- Negative when 2 < x < 3

- Positive when x > 3

But the inequality we have is [x(x - 2)] / (x - 3) ≤ 0. So we need the intervals where the expression is negative or zero.

Looking at the intervals:

Negative when x < 0

Negative when 2 < x < 3

Including the zeros at x = 0, x = 2, and x = 3 (but x = 3 is excluded because denominator is zero there).

So the solution set for x is:

x ∈ (-∞, 0] ∪ (2, 3)

But x is log n, and since n is a positive integer, log n is defined for n ≥ 1. Also, log n can be any real number, but n must be an integer, so x can be any real number such that n = 10^x is an integer.

Wait, but x is log n, so x can be any real number, but n must be an integer. However, for our purposes, we can just solve for x in the intervals and then translate back to n.

So first interval: x ≤ 0. But log n ≤ 0 implies n ≤ 10^0 = 1. Since n is a positive integer, n = 1.

Second interval: 2 < x < 3. So log n is between 2 and 3, which implies n is between 10^2 = 100 and 10^3 = 1000. Since n is an integer, n can be 101, 102, ..., 999. But wait, 100 is 10^2, so log 100 = 2, which is excluded because x must be greater than 2. Similarly, 1000 is excluded.

So n can be integers from 101 to 999 inclusive.

Therefore, the possible values of n are:

n = 1 and integers from 101 to 999 inclusive.

Now, let's count how many integers that is.

First, n = 1 is one integer.

Then, from 101 to 999 inclusive. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So 999 - 101 + 1 = 900 - 101 + 1? Wait: 999 - 101 = 898, plus 1 is 899. Wait, let me check:

From 101 to 999 inclusive:

Number of terms is 999 - 101 + 1 = 900 - 100 + 1? Wait, 999 - 101 = 898, then +1 is 899. Wait, 101 to 102 is 2 numbers: 101 and 102. So 102 - 101 +1 = 2. So yes, 999 - 101 +1 = 899.

Therefore, total integers n is 1 + 899 = 900.

But wait, hold on. We need to check if all these values of x satisfy the original inequality. Let me verify.

Wait, in the first interval, x ≤ 0. Then log n ≤ 0 implies n ≤ 1, but n is a positive integer, so n=1.

Then, in the second interval, 2 < x < 3, so log n is between 2 and 3, which gives n between 100 and 1000, exclusive. So n=101 to 999.

But wait, we also need to ensure that the denominator is not zero. The denominator is log n - 3, which is zero when log n = 3, i.e., n=1000. So n=1000 is excluded, which is already accounted for in our second interval (n up to 999).

But also, we need to make sure that the numerator is defined. Since log n is defined for n > 0, which is already satisfied as n is a positive integer.

But hold on, let's check the original expression again. The numerator is [2 log n - (log n)^2], which is defined for all n > 0. The denominator is log n - 3, which is defined for n > 0. So as long as n is a positive integer, other than 1000, the expression is defined. But we have more constraints from the square root.

Wait, the square root requires that the entire fraction is non-negative. So even though the denominator is non-zero (except at n=1000), we need the fraction to be non-negative. So we have to make sure that both numerator and denominator have the same sign (both positive or both negative) or that the numerator is zero.

But in our earlier analysis, we found that x ∈ (-∞, 0] ∪ (2, 3). So translating back to n:

For x ≤ 0, log n ≤ 0, so n=1.

For x ∈ (2, 3), log n ∈ (2,3), so n ∈ (100,1000), which gives integers from 101 to 999 inclusive.

But let's check if there are any other constraints. For example, if the numerator is zero, the square root is zero, which is allowed. The numerator is 2 log n - (log n)^2. Setting this equal to zero:

2 log n - (log n)^2 = 0

log n (2 - log n) = 0

So log n = 0 or log n = 2

Which implies n = 10^0 = 1 or n = 10^2 = 100.

But in our intervals, x=0 is included in the first interval (x ≤ 0), and x=2 is excluded because the second interval is (2,3). Wait, x=2 is excluded because the interval is open at 2. So n=100 is not included. Wait, but log n=2 implies n=100, but our solution set for x is x ≤ 0 or 2 < x <3. So x=2 is not included. Therefore, n=100 is excluded. But when log n=2, numerator is zero, so sqrt(0)=0, which is allowed. Therefore, we need to check if n=100 is allowed.

Wait, because if x=2, then the numerator is zero, so the fraction becomes 0/(2 - 3) = 0/(-1) = 0, which is allowed. So sqrt(0) is 0, which is a real number. Therefore, n=100 should be included.

But in our earlier interval, we had x ∈ (-∞,0] ∪ (2,3). So x=2 is not included, which would imply n=100 is excluded. But that's a problem because n=100 makes the numerator zero, so the expression is zero, which is allowed. Therefore, we need to adjust our intervals.

Wait, let's revisit the inequality:

[ x(x - 2) ] / (x - 3) ≤ 0

We found that the solution set is x ∈ (-∞, 0] ∪ (2, 3)

But when x=2, the numerator becomes zero, so [2(2 - 2)] / (2 - 3) = 0 / (-1) = 0, which is ≤ 0. So x=2 should be included. Therefore, the correct solution set is x ∈ (-∞, 0] ∪ [2, 3)

Wait, because at x=2, the expression is zero, which satisfies the inequality. So earlier, I had written (2,3), but it should be [2,3). Let me check that again.

Original inequality after simplifying:

[ x(x - 2) ] / (x - 3) ≤ 0

Critical points at x=0, x=2, x=3.

Testing intervals:

1. x < 0: expression is positive (as before)

2. 0 < x <2: expression is positive

3. 2 <x <3: expression is negative

4. x>3: expression is positive

But at x=2: numerator is zero, denominator is (2 -3)=-1, so expression is 0/(-1)=0, which is ≤0. So x=2 is included. At x=3: denominator is zero, so undefined. Therefore, the solution set is x ∈ (-∞,0] ∪ [2,3)

Therefore, translating back to n:

x ∈ (-∞,0] ∪ [2,3) => log n ∈ (-∞,0] ∪ [2,3)

Which corresponds to:

log n ≤ 0 => n=1

or

2 ≤ log n <3 => 10^2 ≤ n <10^3 => 100 ≤ n <1000

Since n is an integer, 100 ≤ n ≤999.

Therefore, n=1 and integers from 100 to 999 inclusive.

Therefore, the integers are n=1 and n=100 to 999. So total number of integers is 1 + (999 -100 +1) = 1 + 900 = 901.

Wait, but earlier I thought n=100 is included, so from 100 to 999 inclusive. Let's check that.

But log n=2 gives n=100, which is included in the second interval. So n=100 is included. Then, the second interval is [2,3), so log n ∈ [2,3) translates to n ∈ [100, 1000). Since n is integer, n=100 to 999 inclusive. So that's 999 -100 +1 = 900 numbers. Then n=1, so total 901.

But wait, earlier, the initial calculation was 1 + 899 = 900. But that was when the second interval was (101 to999). But now, with the correction, the second interval includes n=100, so 100 to999 inclusive is 900 numbers. Therefore, total 901. So which is correct?

Wait, let's check with specific numbers.

If n=100, log n=2. Then numerator is 2*2 - (2)^2 = 4 -4 =0. Denominator is 2 -3= -1. So the fraction is 0/-1=0. So sqrt(0)=0, which is allowed. Therefore, n=100 is allowed.

Similarly, n=1000 is log n=3, which is excluded because denominator is zero. So n=1000 is excluded.

Therefore, the second interval is 100 ≤n <1000, but since n is integer, n=100 to999 inclusive. So 999 -100 +1=900 numbers.

Plus n=1, so total 901 numbers.

But wait, in the initial critical points, when solving the inequality [x(x - 2)]/(x -3) ≤0, the solution is x ≤0 or 2 ≤x <3. Therefore, translating back to n, x=log n, so:

n=1 (since log n ≤0 => n=1)

and n such that 2 ≤log n <3 => 100 ≤n <1000. Since n is integer, n=100 to999 inclusive.

Therefore, the total number is 1 + (999 -100 +1)=1 +900=901.

But earlier, when I thought x=2 was excluded, I had 899. But that was incorrect. The correct count is 901.

Wait, but let's check with an example. Let's pick n=100.

Compute numerator: log(100^2) - (log100)^2 = log(10000) - (2)^2 =4 -4=0

Denominator: log100 -3=2-3=-1

So the fraction is 0/-1=0, sqrt(0)=0, which is real. So n=100 is allowed.

Similarly, n=1: log1=0.

Numerator: 2*0 -0^2=0

Denominator:0 -3= -3

Fraction: 0/-3=0, sqrt(0)=0, allowed.

n=999:

log(999^2) - (log999)^2 ≈ log(998001) - (2.999565)^2 ≈ 6.9991 - 8.997 ≈ -1.9979

Denominator: log999 -3≈2.999565 -3≈-0.000435

So the fraction is (-1.9979)/(-0.000435)≈4593.5, which is positive. Therefore, sqrt(4593.5) is real.

Similarly, n=1000 is excluded because denominator is zero.

Therefore, the correct total is 901 integers.

But wait, let's check n=100. The fraction is zero, which is allowed. So included. Then n from 100 to999 inclusive is 900 numbers, plus n=1, total 901.

But let's double-check the count from 100 to999 inclusive.

The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b -a +1.

999 -100 +1=900. Yes, that's correct.

Plus n=1: 1+900=901.

Therefore, the final answer should be 901.

But wait, earlier in the problem statement, the user wrote:

"For how many integers $n$ does the expression [...] represent a real number"

But let's check n=1:

log(1^2)=0, (log1)^2=0, numerator=0-0=0, denominator=0-3=-3. So 0/-3=0, sqrt(0)=0. So allowed.

n=100: as above, allowed.

n=999: allowed.

n=1000: excluded.

So all n=1 and n=100 to999 inclusive.

Therefore, the answer is 901.

But wait, let me check if there are any other possible n that might be excluded.

Wait, the denominator is log n -3. For the denominator to not be zero, log n ≠3, which is n≠1000. So n=1000 is excluded. But we already accounted for that.

Also, the numerator can be zero when log n=0 or log n=2, which is n=1 and n=100. Both are included in the solution set.

Therefore, total integers are 1 + (999 -100 +1)=1 +900=901.

Therefore, the final answer is \boxed{901}

**Final Answer**
\boxed{901}
Therefore, there are $\boxed{901}$ integers $n$ that make the expression real.
