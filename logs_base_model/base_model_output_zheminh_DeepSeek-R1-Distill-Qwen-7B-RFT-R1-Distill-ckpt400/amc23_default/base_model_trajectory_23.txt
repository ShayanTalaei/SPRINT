Okay, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. So Maureen is tracking the mean of her quiz scores. The problem gives two scenarios: one where if she scores 11 on the next quiz, her mean increases by 1. Another scenario where if she scores 11 on each of the next three quizzes, her mean increases by 2. We need to find the current mean of her quiz scores.

First, let's define some variables to make this clearer. Let's say that currently, Maureen has taken 'n' quizzes, and the mean of those scores is 'm'. So the total sum of her current quiz scores would be S = n * m.

Now, the first scenario: she takes one more quiz and scores 11. The new mean becomes m + 1. So the total number of quizzes becomes n + 1, and the total sum becomes S + 11. The new mean is (S + 11)/(n + 1) = m + 1.

Similarly, the second scenario: she takes three more quizzes, each scoring 11. The new mean becomes m + 2. The total number of quizzes becomes n + 3, and the total sum becomes S + 33. The new mean is (S + 33)/(n + 3) = m + 2.

So we have two equations here:

1. (S + 11)/(n + 1) = m + 1
2. (S + 33)/(n + 3) = m + 2

But we also know that S = n * m. So we can substitute S in both equations.

Let's substitute S = n*m into the first equation:

(n*m + 11)/(n + 1) = m + 1

Multiply both sides by (n + 1):

n*m + 11 = (m + 1)(n + 1)

Expanding the right side:

n*m + 11 = m*n + m + n + 1

Subtract n*m from both sides:

11 = m + n + 1

So that simplifies to:

m + n = 10  ...(1)

Now, let's do the same substitution for the second equation:

(n*m + 33)/(n + 3) = m + 2

Multiply both sides by (n + 3):

n*m + 33 = (m + 2)(n + 3)

Expanding the right side:

n*m + 33 = m*n + 3m + 2n + 6

Subtract n*m from both sides:

33 = 3m + 2n + 6

Subtract 6 from both sides:

27 = 3m + 2n  ...(2)

Now we have two equations:

1. m + n = 10
2. 3m + 2n = 27

We can solve this system of equations. Let's use substitution. From equation (1), n = 10 - m. Substitute this into equation (2):

3m + 2(10 - m) = 27

Expand:

3m + 20 - 2m = 27

Combine like terms:

m + 20 = 27

Subtract 20:

m = 7

So the current mean is 7. Let's check if this makes sense.

If m = 7, then n = 10 - 7 = 3. So currently, Maureen has taken 3 quizzes with a total sum of 3*7=21.

First scenario: She scores 11 on the next quiz. Total sum becomes 21 + 11 = 32. Number of quizzes is 4. New mean is 32/4 = 8, which is indeed 1 more than 7. That checks out.

Second scenario: She scores 11 three times. Total sum becomes 21 + 33 = 54. Number of quizzes is 6. New mean is 54/6 = 9, which is 2 more than 7. That also checks out.

So the calculations seem correct. The current mean is 7.
Therefore, the mean of her quiz scores currently is $\boxed{7}$.
