Okay, so Janet is rolling a standard 6-sided die four times, and she keeps a running total of the numbers she rolls. We need to find the probability that at some point, her running total equals 3. The answer should be in the form of m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.

First, let's clarify the problem. Janet rolls the die four times, so the possible outcomes are sequences of four numbers each between 1 and 6. The running total after each roll is the sum of the first, first two, first three, and first four rolls respectively. We need the probability that at least one of these running totals is exactly 3. So, in other words, we need to find all sequences where the sum after the first roll is 3, or the sum after the second roll is 3, or the sum after the third roll is 3, or the sum after the fourth roll is 3. Then, divide that by the total number of possible sequences, which is 6^4, since each die roll is independent.

But calculating this directly might be tricky because the events are not mutually exclusive. For example, a sequence might have a running total of 3 at both the first and third roll. So, we need to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to avoid overcounting.

Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to model this. Let's think about the possible running totals. The running total after the first roll must be between 1 and 6. So, 3 is possible only if the first roll is 3. Then, for the second roll, the running total could be 3 again, which would require the second roll to be 0, which isn't possible. Wait, no. Wait, the running total after the second roll is the sum of the first two rolls. So, if the first roll was 3, then the second roll could be anything, but the total would be 3 + second roll. Since the first roll is 3, the second total would be 3 + something between 1-6, so 4-9. So, the second running total can't be 3 if the first one was 3. So, maybe the events where the running total is 3 at different points are actually mutually exclusive? Wait, no. For example, if the first two rolls are 2 and 1, the running totals after first and second rolls are 2 and 3. So, the running total is 3 at the second roll. But if the first roll is 3, then the second running total is 4-9, so 3 can't be achieved again. Wait, but suppose the first running total is 3, then the second is 3 + something. So, 3 can only be achieved once, right? Because once you have a running total of 3, the next one is 3 plus another die roll (1-6), so the next total can't be 3 again. So, maybe the events where 3 is achieved at different points are mutually exclusive? That would simplify things because then the total number of sequences where 3 is achieved at any point is just the sum of the probabilities of 3 being achieved at the first, second, third, or fourth roll, without worrying about overlaps.

But wait, let's check with an example. Suppose the first two rolls are 2 and 1. Then, the running totals are 2 and 3. So, 3 is achieved at the second roll. But if the first roll is 3, then the running total is 3 at the first roll, and then the second total is 4-9. So, no overlap. Another example: first roll 1, second roll 2. Then running totals are 1, 3. So, 3 at the second roll. If the first two rolls are 3, then 3 at the first roll. So, in this case, 3 can only occur once. Therefore, the events where 3 is achieved at different points are mutually exclusive. Therefore, the total number of sequences where 3 is achieved at some point is equal to the number of sequences where 3 is achieved at the first roll, plus the number of sequences where 3 is achieved at the second roll, plus the number of sequences where 3 is achieved at the third roll, plus the number of sequences where 3 is achieved at the fourth roll.

Therefore, we can compute each of these four cases separately and sum them up. Let's proceed step by step.

First, the probability that the running total is 3 at the first roll. Since the first roll is a single die roll, the only way the running total is 3 is if the first roll is 3. The probability of that is 1/6.

Second, the probability that the running total is 3 at the second roll. For this, the first two rolls must sum to 3. The possible combinations for two dice rolls that sum to 3 are (1,2) and (2,1). So, there are 2 possible outcomes. Since each die roll is independent, the probability here is 2/(6*6) = 2/36 = 1/18.

Third, the probability that the running total is 3 at the third roll. This requires that the sum of the first three rolls is 3. However, since each die roll is at least 1, the minimum sum after three rolls is 3 (1+1+1). So, the only way the sum is 3 is if the first three rolls are all 1s. So, the only possible outcome is (1,1,1). The probability here is 1/(6^3) = 1/216.

Fourth, the probability that the running total is 3 at the fourth roll. This requires that the sum of the first four rolls is 3. But since each die is at least 1, the minimum sum after four rolls is 4. Therefore, it's impossible for the running total to be 3 at the fourth roll. Therefore, the probability here is 0.

Therefore, the total probability is the sum of these four probabilities: 1/6 + 1/18 + 1/216 + 0. Let's compute this.

First, convert all fractions to have a common denominator of 216:

1/6 = 36/216

1/18 = 12/216

1/216 = 1/216

Adding them up: 36 + 12 + 1 = 49. So, 49/216.

But wait, is this correct? Because earlier we assumed that these events are mutually exclusive. But let's verify if this is the case.

Is there a sequence where the running total equals 3 at both the first and second roll? For example, the first roll is 3, and the second roll is 0, but since die rolls are 1-6, that's impossible. So, no, 3 can't be achieved at both the first and second roll. Similarly, if the first two rolls sum to 3, the third total can't be 3 because the third total is the sum of the first three rolls, which is at least 1+1+1=3, but the first two rolls already sum to 3, so the third total would be 3 + third roll, which is at least 4. Therefore, 3 can't be achieved at both the second and third roll. Similarly, if the first three rolls sum to 3, then the fourth total is 3 + fourth roll, which is at least 4. So, 3 can't be achieved at the fourth roll if it was achieved at the third. Therefore, these events are indeed mutually exclusive. Therefore, adding them up is correct.

Therefore, the total probability is 49/216. Then, m is 49, n is 216. Are these coprime? Let's check. The prime factors of 49 are 7^2. The prime factors of 216 are 2^3 * 3^3. No common factors, so yes, they are coprime. Therefore, m + n = 49 + 216 = 265.

Wait, but hold on a second. Let me double-check this. Because sometimes when dealing with probabilities, especially when considering different points, there might be cases where the same sequence is counted multiple times. But in this case, since the events are mutually exclusive (as we established earlier), there's no overlap. So, adding the probabilities should be correct.

But let's test this with an example. Suppose we have a smaller case, say rolling the die twice. What's the probability that the running total equals 3 at some point?

Possible sequences:

First roll: 3, then any second roll. So, sequences like (3,1), (3,2), ..., (3,6). That's 6 sequences.

Second roll: The first two rolls sum to 3. The possible sequences are (1,2), (2,1). So, 2 sequences.

Total sequences where running total is 3: 6 + 2 = 8. Total possible sequences: 6^2 = 36. So, probability is 8/36 = 2/9.

But according to our formula, for two rolls:

First probability: 1/6 (first roll is 3)

Second probability: 2/36 = 1/18

Total probability: 1/6 + 1/18 = 4/18 = 2/9. Which matches. So, that works.

Similarly, for three rolls. Suppose we want the probability that the running total is 3 at some point.

Possible sequences:

First roll: 3, followed by any two rolls. That's 6^2 = 36 sequences.

Second roll: first two rolls sum to 3. The possible sequences are (1,2, anything), (2,1, anything). So, 2 * 6 = 12 sequences.

Third roll: first three rolls sum to 3. Only possible sequence is (1,1,1). So, 1 sequence.

Total sequences: 36 + 12 + 1 = 49. Total possible sequences: 6^3 = 216. Probability: 49/216. Which matches our previous result. So, this seems correct.

Therefore, applying this logic to four rolls, the probability is 49/216, so m + n is 265.

But wait, let me check if there's another approach. For instance, using recursion or dynamic programming.

Alternatively, the problem can be modeled using states where each state represents the current total. We can model the process as a Markov chain where each state is the current sum, and transitions are adding the next die roll. We need to compute the probability of ever reaching 3 in four steps, starting from 0.

But since the number of steps is limited to four, we can compute the number of sequences that reach 3 at each step and sum them up, as we did before.

Alternatively, we can use the reflection principle or inclusion-exclusion, but given that the events are mutually exclusive, the inclusion-exclusion approach simplifies to just adding the probabilities.

Another way to think about it is that the total number of sequences where the running total is 3 at some point is equal to the number of sequences where the first occurrence of the running total being 3 is at the first, second, third, or fourth roll. Since these are mutually exclusive, we can compute each and sum.

Thus, I think the initial approach is correct. Therefore, the probability is 49/216, so m + n is 265.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{265}
Therefore, the probability that at some point Janet's running total will equal $3$ is $\boxed{265}$.
