Okay, so I need to find the number of sequences of subsets A₁, A₂, ..., Aₙ where n is a positive integer up to 10. Each A_i is a subset of {1, 2, ..., 10}, and each A_{i-1} is a subset of A_i. Then, I need to find K modulo 10. 

First, let me understand the problem. Each sequence is a chain of subsets where each is contained within the next. The length of the chain can be from 1 to 10. For each possible n (1 to 10), I need to count how many such chains there are, then sum all those counts for n=1 to n=10, and finally take the result modulo 10.

Hmm, so K is the sum over n=1 to 10 of the number of chains of subsets of length n. For each n, the number of chains is the number of sequences where each subset is contained in the next. 

I remember that for a single set, the number of chains (totally ordered subsets under inclusion) of length k in the power set is equal to the sum over all subsets S of the number of chains from the empty set to S with length k. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for the number of chains of length n in the power set of a 10-element set.

Wait, let me think. Each element in the set {1,2,...,10} can be considered independently in terms of its membership in the subsets A₁, A₂, ..., Aₙ. Since each A_i must be a subset of A_{i+1}, each element can either be added at some step or never added. 

For each element, the possible ways it can be included in the sequence of subsets are: it can be in none of them, or it can be added at exactly one of the steps from 1 to n. So for each element, there are n+1 choices (either never included, or included starting at step 1, step 2, ..., step n). 

Therefore, for each element, there are (n + 1) choices. Since the elements are independent, the total number of chains of length n is (n + 1)^10. Wait, is that correct?

Wait, let's test with small n. For n=1, the number of chains should be 2^10, because each subset is just itself. According to the formula, (1 + 1)^10 = 2^10, which matches. For n=2, each element can be in none, first subset only, or both subsets. That's 3 choices per element, so 3^10. Which would be the number of chains of length 2. That seems correct. So yes, the formula is (n + 1)^10 for each n. 

Therefore, for each n from 1 to 10, the number of chains is (n + 1)^10. So K is the sum from n=1 to n=10 of (n + 1)^10. Then, K mod 10 is the sum of (n + 1)^10 mod 10 for n=1 to 10, each term mod 10, then sum those mod 10.

Alternatively, since K is the sum of (n + 1)^10 for n=1 to 10, which is the same as sum_{m=2}^{11} m^10. So K = sum_{m=2}^{11} m^10. Then, K mod 10 is equal to sum_{m=2}^{11} (m^10 mod 10) mod 10.

Therefore, I need to compute m^10 mod 10 for m from 2 to 11, then sum those up and take mod 10.

Wait, but m from 2 to 11, but m=11 is equivalent to m=1 mod 10, since 11 mod 10 is 1. So m=11 is 1 mod 10. So m=2 to 11 correspond to m=2 to 10, and then m=1. So perhaps compute m^10 mod 10 for m=2 to 10 and m=1, then sum those.

But m=1: 1^10 mod 10 is 1. Then m=2 to 10: compute each m^10 mod 10.

But maybe there's a pattern here. Let's recall that for modulus 10, the last digit of m^10 depends on the last digit of m. Since 10 is composite, Euler's theorem might help. Euler's totient function φ(10)=4. So for m coprime to 10, m^4 ≡1 mod 10, so m^10 = m^(4*2 + 2) = (m^4)^2 * m^2 ≡1^2 * m^2 = m^2 mod 10. So for m coprime to 10, m^10 ≡ m^2 mod 10.

For m not coprime to 10, i.e., m even or divisible by 5, the behavior is different.

Let me list m from 1 to 10 and compute m^10 mod 10:

m=1: 1^10=1 mod10=1

m=2: 2^10. Let's compute 2^10. 2^10=1024. 1024 mod10=4

m=3: 3^10. Since 3 and 10 are coprime. φ(10)=4. So 3^4=81≡1 mod10. So 3^10=3^(4*2 + 2)= (3^4)^2 *3^2 ≡1^2 *9=9 mod10.

m=4: 4 and 10 are not coprime. Let's compute 4^10. 4^2=16≡6 mod10. 4^4=(4^2)^2=6^2=36≡6 mod10. 4^8=(4^4)^2=6^2=36≡6 mod10. Then 4^10=4^8 *4^2=6*6=36≡6 mod10.

m=5: 5^10. Any power of 5 ends with 5 or 25, but mod10, 5^1=5, 5^2=25≡5 mod10. So 5^10≡5 mod10.

m=6: 6 and 10 are not coprime. 6^1=6, 6^2=36≡6 mod10. So 6^10≡6 mod10.

m=7: coprime to 10. φ(10)=4. 7^4≡1 mod10. So 7^10=7^(4*2 +2)=1^2 *7^2=49≡9 mod10.

m=8: 8 and 10 not coprime. 8^1=8, 8^2=64≡4, 8^3=8*4=32≡2, 8^4=8*2=16≡6, 8^5=8*6=48≡8, and then the cycle repeats every 4. 8^10: 10 divided by 4 is 2 with remainder 2. So 8^10≡8^(4*2 + 2)= (8^4)^2 *8^2 ≡6^2 *4=36*4≡6*4=24≡4 mod10.

m=9: coprime to 10. φ(10)=4. 9^4≡1 mod10. So 9^10=9^(4*2 +2)=1^2 *9^2=81≡1 mod10.

m=10: 10^10≡0 mod10.

So compiling these:

m=1: 1

m=2: 4

m=3:9

m=4:6

m=5:5

m=6:6

m=7:9

m=8:4

m=9:1

m=10:0

But wait, in our problem, K is the sum from m=2 to m=11 of m^10 mod10. But m=11 is equivalent to m=1 mod10, so m=11 gives 1^10 mod10=1. So the terms are:

m=2:4

m=3:9

m=4:6

m=5:5

m=6:6

m=7:9

m=8:4

m=9:1

m=10:0

m=11:1

So sum these up:

4 +9 +6 +5 +6 +9 +4 +1 +0 +1.

Let's compute step by step:

Start with 4.

4 +9 =13

13 +6=19

19 +5=24

24 +6=30

30 +9=39

39 +4=43

43 +1=44

44 +0=44

44 +1=45.

So the total sum mod10 is 45 mod10=5.

Therefore, K mod10 is 5.

Wait, but let me verify again, because it's easy to make a mistake in arithmetic.

List of m^10 mod10 for m=2 to 11:

m=2:4

m=3:9

m=4:6

m=5:5

m=6:6

m=7:9

m=8:4

m=9:1

m=10:0

m=11:1

Adding these:

4 +9 =13

13 +6=19

19 +5=24

24 +6=30

30 +9=39

39 +4=43

43 +1=44

44 +0=44

44 +1=45

45 mod10=5.

Yes, that's correct. So the remainder when K is divided by 10 is 5.

But wait, let me check if my initial formula was correct. Because for each n, the number of chains is (n +1)^10. So K is sum_{n=1}^{10} (n +1)^10 = sum_{m=2}^{11} m^10. Then K mod10 is sum_{m=2}^{11} (m^10 mod10). Which we computed as 45, so 5 mod10. 

Yes, that seems right. So the answer is 5.
Therefore, the remainder when $K$ is divided by $10$ is $\boxed{5}$.
