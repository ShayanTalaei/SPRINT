Okay, let's see. I need to find the number of digits in the base-ten representation of the expression 8^5 multiplied by 5^10 multiplied by 15^5. Hmm, digits... So, the number of digits in a number is related to its logarithm, right? Because the number of digits d of a number N is given by d = floor(log10(N)) + 1. So, maybe I can compute the logarithm of the entire expression and then take the floor and add one to get the number of digits. That sounds like a plan.

First, let me write down the expression again to make sure I have it right: 8^5 * 5^10 * 15^5. Let me break this down into prime factors or something more manageable. Let's see, 8 is 2^3, 5 is 5, and 15 is 3*5. Maybe if I factor everything into primes, it will help me combine the exponents.

So, 8^5 is (2^3)^5 = 2^(15). Then 5^10 stays as is. 15^5 is (3*5)^5 = 3^5 * 5^5. So putting it all together, the entire expression becomes:

2^15 * 5^10 * 3^5 * 5^5. Wait, combining the 5s: 5^10 * 5^5 is 5^(15). So now the expression is 2^15 * 5^15 * 3^5. Hmm, 2^15 * 5^15 is (2*5)^15 = 10^15. So then the expression simplifies to 10^15 * 3^5. So that's 3^5 multiplied by 10^15. 

So, 3^5 is 243. Therefore, the entire expression is 243 * 10^15. Now, 243 * 10^15 is just the number 243 followed by 15 zeros. So, how many digits is that? Well, 243 is three digits, and then 15 zeros, so total digits are 3 + 15 = 18. Wait, but let me check that again.

Wait, 10^15 is 1 followed by 15 zeros, so 10^15 is 1,000,000,000,000,000. Then multiplying by 243 would shift that by 15 places, so 243 * 10^15 is 243,000,000,000,000,000. Counting the digits: 243 is three digits, then 15 zeros. So total digits are 3 + 15 = 18. So, the answer should be 18 digits. 

But wait, let me verify this another way using logarithms. Let's compute log10(8^5 * 5^10 * 15^5) and then take the floor and add one. Let's compute each part:

log10(8^5) = 5 * log10(8) = 5 * log10(2^3) = 5 * 3 * log10(2) ≈ 5 * 3 * 0.3010 ≈ 5 * 0.9030 ≈ 4.515.

log10(5^10) = 10 * log10(5) ≈ 10 * 0.69897 ≈ 6.9897.

log10(15^5) = 5 * log10(15) = 5 * (log10(3) + log10(5)) ≈ 5 * (0.4771 + 0.69897) ≈ 5 * 1.17607 ≈ 5.88035.

Adding all these together: 4.515 + 6.9897 + 5.88035 ≈ 17.385. Then take floor(17.385) + 1 = 17 + 1 = 18. So that matches the previous result. So, both methods give 18 digits. Therefore, the answer should be 18.

Wait, but let me check once more to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Let's recompute the logarithm values step by step.

First, log10(2) is approximately 0.3010, log10(3) is approximately 0.4771, log10(5) is approximately 0.69897.

So, log10(8^5) = 5 * log10(8) = 5 * log10(2^3) = 5 * 3 * 0.3010 = 5 * 0.9030 = 4.515. Correct.

log10(5^10) = 10 * log10(5) ≈ 10 * 0.69897 = 6.9897. Correct.

log10(15^5) = 5 * (log10(3) + log10(5)) = 5 * (0.4771 + 0.69897) = 5 * 1.17607 ≈ 5.88035. Correct.

Adding them up: 4.515 + 6.9897 = 11.5047; 11.5047 + 5.88035 ≈ 17.38505. So floor(17.38505) is 17, plus 1 gives 18. Correct.

Alternatively, when I simplified the expression earlier, I saw that 8^5 * 15^5 simplifies to 10^15 * 3^5. Then 3^5 is 243, so 243 * 10^15 is 2.43 * 10^17? Wait, hold on. Wait, 243 * 10^15 is 2.43 * 10^2 * 10^15 = 2.43 * 10^17. Wait, but then log10(2.43 * 10^17) is log10(2.43) + 17 ≈ 0.3856 + 17 = 17.3856, which is approximately the same as before. So floor(17.3856) + 1 = 17 + 1 = 18. So that also gives 18. So all methods confirm that the number of digits is 18.

Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 18 digits.
Therefore, the number of digits in the base-ten representation of $8^5 \cdot 5^{10} \cdot 15^5$ is $\boxed{18}$.
