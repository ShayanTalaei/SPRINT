Okay, so I need to find the area of the region defined by the inequality ||x| - 1| + ||y| - 1| ≤ 1. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated with all the absolute value signs. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that absolute value equations can define regions in the coordinate plane, and when combined with inequalities, they often form shapes like diamonds or squares. But here, there are multiple layers of absolute values, so maybe it's a more complex figure.

Let me start by analyzing the equation ||x| - 1| + ||y| - 1| ≤ 1. Since both x and y are inside absolute value signs, the equation is symmetric with respect to both the x-axis and y-axis. That means the region defined by this inequality will be symmetric in all four quadrants. So, if I can figure out the shape in the first quadrant (where x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0), I can multiply the area by 4 to get the total area. That might simplify things.

So, in the first quadrant, |x| = x and |y| = y. Therefore, the equation becomes |x - 1| + |y - 1| ≤ 1. Wait, that's a bit simpler. Let me write that down:

In the first quadrant: |x - 1| + |y - 1| ≤ 1.

This looks like the equation of a diamond (a square rotated 45 degrees) centered at (1,1) with a certain radius. But let me confirm that.

The general form |x - a| + |y - b| ≤ c defines a diamond centered at (a, b) with its vertices at a distance of c along the axes. So here, a = 1, b = 1, and c = 1. That means the diamond's vertices are at (1 + 1, 1), (1 - 1, 1), (1, 1 + 1), and (1, 1 - 1), which simplifies to (2,1), (0,1), (1,2), and (1,0). But wait, in the first quadrant, x and y are non-negative. So the points (0,1) and (1,0) are on the axes, which are still in the first quadrant. The other two vertices, (2,1) and (1,2), are also in the first quadrant. So this diamond is entirely within the first quadrant? Wait, but (2,1) is at x=2, which is still positive, and (1,2) is y=2, also positive. So yes, the diamond is entirely in the first quadrant.

But wait, let me check if that's correct. Let's take some points. For example, (2,1): |2 - 1| + |1 - 1| = 1 + 0 = 1, which is equal to 1, so it's on the boundary. Similarly, (1,2): same thing. (0,1) and (1,0) are also on the boundary. So the diamond has its four vertices at those points. Therefore, in the first quadrant, the region is a diamond with vertices at (0,1), (1,0), (2,1), (1,2). Wait, but connecting those points, how is the shape?

Let me plot these points mentally. Starting at (0,1), moving to (1,0), then to (2,1), then to (1,2), and back to (0,1). Connecting these in order, the diamond would have four edges. Each edge is a straight line between two consecutive points. So, from (0,1) to (1,0): that's a line with slope -1. From (1,0) to (2,1): slope 1. From (2,1) to (1,2): slope -1. From (1,2) to (0,1): slope 1. So yes, it's a diamond shape with those four vertices.

Now, the area of a diamond (which is a square rotated 45 degrees) can be calculated if we know the lengths of the diagonals. The area is (d1 * d2)/2. Here, the diagonals are the distances between (0,1) and (2,1), which is 2 units, and between (1,0) and (1,2), which is 2 units. So the area would be (2 * 2)/2 = 2. Therefore, the area in the first quadrant is 2.

But wait, let me confirm this. Alternatively, since the diamond is a square with side length sqrt(2), because each edge is the distance between two adjacent vertices. For example, the distance between (0,1) and (1,0) is sqrt((1-0)^2 + (0-1)^2) = sqrt(1 + 1) = sqrt(2). So if the side length is sqrt(2), then the area of a square is (sqrt(2))^2 = 2. So that matches. Alternatively, using the diagonals, since both diagonals are 2 units, area is (2*2)/2 = 2. So that's correct.

Therefore, in the first quadrant, the area is 2. Since the original equation is symmetric across both axes, the entire region is made up of four such diamonds in each quadrant. Wait, no. Wait, actually, when we consider the entire coordinate plane, the original equation is symmetric in x and y, and also symmetric in positive and negative values. So the entire figure would be four times the area of the first quadrant region. But wait, let me check.

Wait, no. Wait, in the first quadrant, we considered x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0. Then, if we mirror that into all four quadrants, the equation would be the same. So each quadrant would have a similar diamond shape. Wait, but in the original equation, the absolute values of x and y are taken first, then subtract 1, then take absolute value again. So the transformations are applied to |x| and |y|, which are always non-negative. So in effect, the equation is symmetric in all four quadrants, so the entire figure is four times the area of the first quadrant region. Therefore, total area would be 4 * 2 = 8. Hmm, but let me verify this again.

Wait, but let me think about the equation again. The original equation is ||x| - 1| + ||y| - 1| ≤ 1. So, if I consider the substitution u = |x|, v = |y|, then the equation becomes |u - 1| + |v - 1| ≤ 1. Since u and v are non-negative, the region defined by this is in the first quadrant of the u-v plane. Then, since u = |x| and v = |y|, each point (u, v) corresponds to four points (±x, ±y) in the original x-y plane. Therefore, the entire region is four times the area in the u-v plane. So if I can find the area in the u-v plane, then multiply by 4 to get the total area.

Wait, but in the u-v plane, the equation |u - 1| + |v - 1| ≤ 1 is the same as the first quadrant region we considered earlier, which has an area of 2. Therefore, the total area in the x-y plane would be 4 * 2 = 8. But wait, but in the u-v plane, each (u, v) corresponds to four points in the x-y plane, so the area is scaled by 4. So if the area in the u-v plane is A, then in the x-y plane it's 4A. Therefore, if the area in the u-v plane is 2, then the total area is 4*2=8.

But wait, let me check this. Let me consider a simple example. Suppose we have the equation |x| + |y| ≤ 1. In the u-v plane, that's u + v ≤ 1, which is a triangle with area 0.5. Then in the x-y plane, each point (u, v) corresponds to four points (±x, ±y), but the area is scaled by 4. So the area in the x-y plane is 4*(0.5) = 2. Which is correct, because the diamond in the x-y plane has an area of 2. So yes, the scaling factor is 4. Therefore, in our problem, if the area in the u-v plane is 2, then the total area is 8.

But wait, but in our case, the equation in the u-v plane is |u - 1| + |v - 1| ≤ 1. Which we found has an area of 2. So then, the total area in the x-y plane is 4*2=8. Therefore, the answer is 8. But let me make sure that this is correct by considering the transformation.

Alternatively, maybe I can approach the problem without substituting u and v. Let's consider the original equation again: ||x| - 1| + ||y| - 1| ≤ 1. Since the equation is symmetric in x and y, and symmetric in positive and negative values, the figure is a union of shapes in each quadrant. But each quadrant's contribution is the same, so we can compute the area in one quadrant and multiply by 4.

So, as we did before, in the first quadrant, x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0, so the equation becomes |x - 1| + |y - 1| ≤ 1. This is a diamond centered at (1,1) with vertices at (0,1), (1,0), (2,1), (1,2). The area of this diamond is 2, as calculated before. Therefore, the total area is 4*2=8.

But wait, let me check if this is correct by considering the entire equation. Let me take some points and see if they satisfy the inequality.

For example, take the point (1,1). Then ||1| -1| + ||1| -1| = |0| + |0| = 0 ≤ 1. So it's inside the region.

Take the point (0,0). Then ||0| -1| + ||0| -1| = | -1 | + | -1 | = 1 + 1 = 2 > 1. So (0,0) is outside the region.

Take the point (2,1). Then ||2| -1| + ||1| -1| = |2 -1| + |1 -1| = 1 + 0 =1 ≤1. So it's on the boundary.

Similarly, (1,2) is on the boundary. So all four vertices of the diamond in the first quadrant are on the boundary, and the center (1,1) is inside. Therefore, the shape in the first quadrant is a diamond with area 2. Therefore, total area is 8.

But wait, let me check another point. For example, (1.5, 1.5). Then ||1.5| -1| + ||1.5| -1| = |0.5| + |0.5| = 1 ≤1. So (1.5,1.5) is on the boundary. Wait, but according to the previous diamond, the diamond in the first quadrant has vertices at (2,1), (1,2), etc., so (1.5,1.5) is inside the diamond. Wait, but according to the equation, (1.5,1.5) would be ||1.5| -1| + ||1.5| -1| = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1, which is equal to 1, so it's on the boundary. But according to the diamond's vertices, (1.5,1.5) is not a vertex, but lies on the edge between (2,1) and (1,2). Wait, but actually, the diamond's edges are between those vertices. So the diamond's edges are from (0,1) to (1,0), (1,0) to (2,1), (2,1) to (1,2), and (1,2) to (0,1). So the center of the diamond is at (1,1). So the point (1.5,1.5) is indeed on the diamond's edge between (2,1) and (1,2). Because moving from (2,1) to (1,2), the line is x + y = 3. But (1.5,1.5) satisfies x + y = 3, so yes, it's on the edge.

Therefore, the diamond in the first quadrant is a square rotated 45 degrees with side length sqrt(2), area 2. So four such diamonds would give 8. Therefore, the total area is 8.

But wait, let me check again. Another way to compute the area is to note that the equation in the u-v plane (u = |x|, v = |y|) is |u -1| + |v -1| ≤1. The area of this region is the same as the area in the first quadrant of the original equation. Then, since each (u, v) corresponds to four points (x, y) except when u=0 or v=0, but since u and v are non-negative, the scaling factor is 4. Therefore, if the area in the u-v plane is 2, then total area is 4*2=8.

But wait, actually, when we do substitution u = |x|, v = |y|, the Jacobian determinant is 4, since each x can be positive or negative, and each y can be positive or negative. Therefore, the area in the x-y plane is 4 times the area in the u-v plane. So if the region defined by |u -1| + |v -1| ≤1 in the u-v plane has area A, then the x-y plane area is 4A. Therefore, if A is 2, then total area is 8.

But let me confirm the area in the u-v plane. The equation is |u -1| + |v -1| ≤1. Let's plot this in the u-v plane. The center is at (1,1), and the shape is a diamond with vertices at (1 +1,1), (1 -1,1), (1,1 +1), (1,1 -1), which are (2,1), (0,1), (1,2), (1,0). So same as before. The area of this diamond is (distance between (0,1) and (2,1)) * (distance between (1,0) and (1,2)) / 2 = (2 * 2)/2 = 2. So area A is 2. Therefore, total area in the x-y plane is 4*2=8. Therefore, the answer is 8.

But let me check another way. Let's consider the original equation without substitution. ||x| -1| + ||y| -1| ≤1. Let's consider different cases based on the values of |x| and |y|.

Case 1: |x| ≥1 and |y| ≥1. Then, ||x| -1| = |x| -1, and ||y| -1| = |y| -1. So the equation becomes (|x| -1) + (|y| -1) ≤1, which simplifies to |x| + |y| ≤3. But since |x| ≥1 and |y| ≥1, this would be the region outside the squares |x| ≤1 and |y| ≤1, but within |x| + |y| ≤3. But wait, this seems complicated. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, let's consider different regions based on |x| and |y| being greater than or equal to 1 or less than 1.

Subcase 1: |x| ≥1 and |y| ≥1.

Then, ||x| -1| = |x| -1 and ||y| -1| = |y| -1. So the equation becomes (|x| -1) + (|y| -1) ≤1 → |x| + |y| ≤3. But since |x| ≥1 and |y| ≥1, this defines a region outside the square |x| ≤1, |y| ≤1, but within |x| + |y| ≤3. However, since |x| and |y| are both ≥1, the intersection of |x| + |y| ≤3 with |x| ≥1 and |y| ≥1 is a polygon. But this might complicate things.

Subcase 2: |x| ≥1 and |y| ≤1.

Then, ||x| -1| = |x| -1, and ||y| -1| = |1 - |y||. So the equation becomes (|x| -1) + (1 - |y|) ≤1 → |x| - |y| ≤1. But since |x| ≥1 and |y| ≤1, |x| - |y| ≤1 implies |x| ≤ |y| +1. Given that |y| ≤1, |x| ≤2. So in this region, we have |x| between 1 and 2, |y| between 0 and 1, and |x| ≤ |y| +1. But since |x| ≥1 and |y| ≤1, the inequality |x| ≤ |y| +1 becomes |x| - |y| ≤1. For example, when |y| is 1, |x| ≤2. When |y| is 0, |x| ≤1. But since |x| ≥1 in this subcase, the region is 1 ≤ |x| ≤ |y| +1, and 0 ≤ |y| ≤1.

Subcase 3: |x| ≤1 and |y| ≥1.

Similar to Subcase 2, the equation becomes (1 - |x|) + (|y| -1) ≤1 → |y| - |x| ≤1. Since |y| ≥1 and |x| ≤1, this implies |y| ≤ |x| +1. Since |x| ≤1, |y| ≤2. So in this region, |y| between 1 and 2, |x| between 0 and1, and |y| ≤ |x| +1.

Subcase 4: |x| ≤1 and |y| ≤1.

Then, ||x| -1| = 1 - |x|, and ||y| -1| = 1 - |y|. So the equation becomes (1 - |x|) + (1 - |y|) ≤1 → 2 - |x| - |y| ≤1 → |x| + |y| ≥1. So in this square |x| ≤1, |y| ≤1, the region is where |x| + |y| ≥1. That is, outside the diamond |x| + |y| ≤1 within the square.

So combining all these subcases, the entire region is a combination of these areas. But this seems complicated. However, since we already found through substitution that the area is 8, and through symmetry, maybe this is the correct answer. But let me check with an example.

Take the point (2, 2). Then ||2| -1| + ||2| -1| = |2 -1| + |2 -1| =1 +1=2 >1. So (2,2) is outside. Take (1,1): ||1| -1| + ||1| -1| =0+0=0 ≤1. Inside. Take (0,0): ||0| -1| + ||0| -1| =1+1=2>1. Outside. Take (1.5,1.5): ||1.5| -1| + ||1.5| -1| =0.5+0.5=1 ≤1. On boundary. Take (0.5,0.5): ||0.5| -1| + ||0.5| -1| =0.5+0.5=1 ≤1. On boundary. Wait, but according to Subcase 4, in |x| ≤1 and |y| ≤1, |x| + |y| ≥1. So (0.5,0.5) is |0.5| + |0.5| =1, which is on the boundary. So that's correct.

But if I take (0.5, 0.5), which is within |x| ≤1 and |y| ≤1, |x| + |y| =1, which is on the boundary. So the region includes the square |x| ≤1, |y| ≤1, but where |x| + |y| ≥1. So that's a square with a diamond cut out from the center.

But when combining all the subcases, the entire region is the combination of four diamonds in each quadrant, each with area 2, totaling 8. Therefore, the answer is 8.

But let me think again. Suppose I didn't use substitution. Let's try to plot the equation in the x-y plane. The original equation is ||x| -1| + ||y| -1| ≤1. Let's consider different cases.

Case 1: |x| ≥1 and |y| ≥1. Then, equation is (|x| -1) + (|y| -1) ≤1 → |x| + |y| ≤3. But since |x| ≥1 and |y| ≥1, this is the region outside the square [1, ∞) x [1, ∞), but within |x| + |y| ≤3. However, since |x| + |y| ≤3 is a diamond with vertices at (3,0), (0,3), (-3,0), (0,-3). But in the region |x| ≥1 and |y| ≥1, the intersection is a polygon bounded by |x| + |y| =3 and |x| ≥1, |y| ≥1. But this seems complex.

Case 2: |x| ≥1 and |y| ≤1. Then, equation is (|x| -1) + (1 - |y|) ≤1 → |x| - |y| ≤1. Since |y| ≤1, |x| ≤ |y| +1. Since |x| ≥1, this becomes 1 ≤ |x| ≤ |y| +1. Since |y| ≤1, |x| can be up to 2. So in this region, the area is between |x| =1 and |x| = |y| +1, with |y| between 0 and1.

Case 3: |x| ≤1 and |y| ≥1. Similar to Case 2, the equation becomes (1 - |x|) + (|y| -1) ≤1 → |y| - |x| ≤1. Since |x| ≤1, |y| ≤ |x| +1. Since |y| ≥1, |y| is between 1 and |x| +1. Since |x| ≤1, |y| can be up to 2. So in this region, the area is between |y| =1 and |y| = |x| +1, with |x| between 0 and1.

Case 4: |x| ≤1 and |y| ≤1. Then, equation is (1 - |x|) + (1 - |y|) ≤1 → |x| + |y| ≥1. So in the square |x| ≤1, |y| ≤1, the region is outside the diamond |x| + |y| =1.

So combining all these cases:

- In the first quadrant:

  - For x ≥1 and y ≥1: region is |x| + |y| ≤3, but since we are in the first quadrant, x + y ≤3. But since x ≥1 and y ≥1, the region is a triangle with vertices at (1,1), (2,1), (1,2). Wait, but in the first quadrant, x and y are positive, so x + y ≤3 intersects the square x ≥1, y ≥1 at (1,2) and (2,1). So the region is a triangle with vertices (1,1), (2,1), (1,2). Area of this triangle is 0.5 * base * height = 0.5 *1 *1=0.5.

  - For x ≥1 and y ≤1: region is x - y ≤1. In the first quadrant, x ≥1, y ≤1. The line x - y =1 intersects x-axis at (1,0) and y-axis at (0,1), but since x ≥1, the relevant intersection is at (1,0). But in first quadrant, y ≤1, so the region is bounded by x - y ≤1, x ≥1, y ≤1. The line x - y =1 in first quadrant is from (1,0) to (2,1). So the area is a quadrilateral with vertices (1,0), (2,1), (1,1), (1,0). Wait, no. Wait, the region is x - y ≤1, x ≥1, y ≤1. So it's the area between x=1 and the line x - y =1, which is x = y +1. For y from 0 to1, x ranges from 1 to y +1. So the area is the integral from y=0 to1 of (y +1 -1) dy = integral from 0 to1 of y dy = 0.5. Similarly, in the first quadrant, the area for x ≥1 and y ≤1 is 0.5.

  - For x ≤1 and y ≥1: similar to above, the equation is y - x ≤1. In first quadrant, x ≤1, y ≥1. The line y - x =1 intersects at (0,1) and (1,2). The region is bounded by y - x ≤1, x ≤1, y ≥1. So the area is a quadrilateral from (0,1) to (1,2) to (1,1) to (0,1). The area is the integral from x=0 to1 of ( (x +1) -1 ) dx = integral from 0 to1 of x dx = 0.5.

  - For x ≤1 and y ≤1: region is x + y ≥1. In first quadrant, x ≤1, y ≤1, x + y ≥1. This is a triangle with vertices at (1,0), (0,1), (1,1). The area is 0.5.

Adding these up in the first quadrant: 0.5 (from x ≥1, y ≥1) + 0.5 (from x ≥1, y ≤1) + 0.5 (from x ≤1, y ≥1) + 0.5 (from x ≤1, y ≤1) = 2. Which matches our previous calculation. Therefore, in the first quadrant, the area is 2, so total area is 4*2=8.

Therefore, the final answer is 8.

But let me check once more with another point. Take (1.5, 1.5), which we know is on the boundary. ||1.5| -1| + ||1.5| -1| =0.5 +0.5=1. So it's on the boundary. So the region includes points up to a certain distance from the center. So the shape is a square rotated 45 degrees, but with vertices at (2,1), (1,2), etc., which are outside the original diamond. Wait, but when we consider the entire equation, the diamond in the u-v plane is the area in the first quadrant, and when we expand to all quadrants, it's four such diamonds. But according to the substitution method, the area is 8. All calculations so far point to 8, so I think that's the correct answer.
Therefore, the area of the region in the coordinate plane defined by $| | x | - 1 | + | | y | - 1 | \le 1$ is $\boxed{8}$.
