But since the apex is at (4,10), each of these lines will divide the triangle into regions. However, the problem states there are eight pieces, each with equal area. So, perhaps each adjacent pair of lines creates a region (a sort of trapezoid or triangle) with equal area.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but if there are nine points (from 0 to 8), and lines drawn from each to the apex, then that would create eight regions between the lines. Each region is a sort of \"slice\" of the triangle. Since the base is divided into eight equal parts, each 1 inch, these slices should each have equal area. That makes sense because when you divide the base of a triangle into equal parts and draw lines from the apex, each resulting region (which are trapezoids except for the first one, which is a smaller triangle) has equal area. That's a property of triangles: if you divide the base into n equal segments and connect each division to the apex, the areas of the resulting regions are equal.

Connecting each division point to the apex divides the original triangle into eight regions. However, in this case, the first region (from the left) is a triangle with base 1 inch, and the last region (on the right) is another triangle with base 1 inch. The regions in between are trapezoids.

If you draw a line from the apex to (1,0), that splits the original triangle into two regions: a smaller triangle on the left with base [0,1] and a quadrilateral. Then drawing a line to (2,0) splits the quadrilateral into another smaller quadrilateral and another region, and so on. Wait, actually, each time you draw a line from the apex to a division point, you're creating a smaller triangle and reducing the remaining area. But in this case, since we need eight equal areas, each subsequent line must be such that the area between two adjacent lines is equal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe each of the eight pieces is a trapezoid, except the first and last ones, which are triangles. Wait, no. If the base is divided into eight equal parts, each 1 inch, then each slice between two adjacent lines would have the same area. But how exactly?\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me recall that in a triangle, if you divide the base into n equal parts and connect those points to the apex, each of the resulting regions will have equal area.

      "\n",
      "Take the first division: from apex (4,10) to (0,0). Wait, but (0,0) is the original left vertex. So the first region is actually the original leftmost triangle, but since we're dividing the base into eight parts, the first line is from apex to (1,0), which would create a small triangle on the left with base [0,1], and the remaining area. Then the next line is from apex to (2,0), creating another region between (1,0) and (2,0), and so on. Each of these regions is a trapezoid with two sides as the lines from the apex and the base segment.\n",

      "Wait, perhaps not. Let me draw it mentally.\n",

      "The original triangle has base 8 inches. Each division is at 1-inch intervals. The first line is from (4,10) to (1,0), creating a triangle with vertices at (0,0), (1,0), and (4,10). Wait, no. If we connect (4,10) to (1,0), then the area to the left of that line is a triangle with vertices (0,0), (1,0), and (4,10). But that area would actually be a quadrilateral, because the original triangle's left side is from (0,0) to (4,10). Wait, hold on. The original triangle is isosceles, so the two equal sides are from (4,10) to (0,0) and (4,10) to (8,0). So, the left side is from (4,10) to (0,0), and the right side is from (4,10) to (8,0). Therefore, when we divide the base into 8 equal parts, each at x = 0,1,2,....,8.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, if we draw lines from (4,10) to each of these division points (1,0), (2,0), etc. , up to (7,0), then each of these lines will divide the original triangle into regions. Each region between two adjacent lines (say from (i,0) to (4,10) and (i+1,0) to (4,10)) will form a quadrilateral. Except for the first and last regions, which are triangles. Wait, actually, the first region is the triangle formed by (0,0), (1,0), and (4,10). Then the next region is the quadrilateral formed by (1,0), (2,0), (4,10), and the line from (1,0) to (4,10). Similarly, all regions except the first and last are quadrilaterals, and the first and last are triangles.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in the Asymptote code, they are drawing from (4,10) to each (i,0) for i from 0 to 8. But since (0,0) and (8,0) are already vertices of the original triangle, those lines are the sides of the original triangle. So the divisions are from (4,10) to each integer division on the base. So, each of the eight regions is between two adjacent lines. The leftmost region is between the line from (4,10) to (0,0) (the original left edge) and (4,10) to (1,0). Similarly, the rightmost region is between (4,10) to (7,0) and (4,10) to (8,0). Each of these regions is a quadrilateral except for the first and last, which are triangles. Wait, actually, even the first region is a quadrilateral? Wait, the original left edge is from (0,0) to (4,10), and the next line is from (1,0) to (4,10). The region between these two lines would have vertices at (0,0), (1,0), (4,10), and the original left edge. Wait, no. If you have two lines: one from (0,0) to (4,10) and another from (1,0) to (4,10). The region between these two lines is actually a quadrilateral with vertices at (0,0), (1,0), intersection point on the left edge? Wait, no. Wait, (0,0) is connected to (4,10), and (1,0) is connected to (4,10). The area between these two lines is actually a triangle with vertices at (0,0), (1,0), and (4,10).

So this means when 100000 is divided by 7, the remainder should be n. But 100000 is a big number. Dividing that directly by 7 would be tedious. There must be a smarter way to do this without having to perform long division on such a large number.\n",
