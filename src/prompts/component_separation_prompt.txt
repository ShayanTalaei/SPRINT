Given below is a math problem and a well-thought out solution to the problem generated by an AI model. The solution contains multiple components (progressing with next steps, verifying past steps, proposing alternative methods, comparing solutions across different methods, etc.). Within each component, there are three phases:
- Planning: Here, the model first thinks out loud and plans what it needs to do. 
- Execution: Here,the model follows the plan and executes it.
- Commenting: Here, the model comments on the execution results with phrases such as "Yes, that seems right", "Both methods lead to the same answer, etc. 

Note that the verification of an execution should be considered as a separate component and not as the commenting phase of the same component.

I am building a new AI system to solve such math problems. This system will consist of two separate AI models -- a planner and an executor. 

The planner will receive all the components of the solution completed so far and will need to think aloud and generate a plan for the next component. Then, it needs to provide a prompt to the executor model to execute a specific task.

The executor will receive all the components of the solution completed so far, the plan for the next component generated by the planner, and the prompt generated by the planner. It will need to execute the specified task.

To train these two AI models, I need to generate training data from the below solution. Hence, you need to break down the solution into separate components. For each component:
- Provide a short description of the component
- Identify the planning phase using line numbers from the solution 
- Provide the prompt to the executor model
- Identify the execution phase using line numbers from the solution
- Identify the commenting phase using line numbers from the solution

Your response MUST follow the format below:

### Component 1 (<Line Number Range>)
- **Description:** <Description>
- **Plan:** Lines <Line Number Range>
- **Prompt:** <Prompt>
- **Execution:** Lines <Line Number Range>
- **Comment:** Lines <Line Number Range>


### Component 2 (<Line Number Range>)
- **Description:** <Description>
- **Plan:** Lines <Line Number Range>
- **Prompt:** <Prompt>
- **Execution:** Lines <Line Number Range>
- **Comment:** Lines <Line Number Range>

... and so on.


Note:
- The planning phase should only include a minimal number of lines required to specify what needs to be done. The remaining lines from the component where the model carries out the plan should be included in the execution phase.
- There MUST be NO overlap between the line numbers of different components. 
- There MUST be NO overlap between the line numbers of the planning and execution phases of the same component.
- All the lines in the solution should be covered by the components.
- Use the line number mentioned at the start and end of each line to identify the line when specifying the line number range.
- The prompt to the executor model must be a very specific instruction that the executor can follow to complete the required task. The executor must not perform more tasks than required. The prompt can refer to the plan for that component by saying "the above plan".
- If the model does not comment on the execution results within a component, the corresponding bullet point can be written as **Comment:** Lines not found
